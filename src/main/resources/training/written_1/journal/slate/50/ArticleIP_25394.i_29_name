Wrap-Up
            

            Even when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forrest Sawyer</ENAMEX> is sitting in, it's still
World <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">News Tonight</ENAMEX> With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Jennings</ENAMEX> . Just because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny</ENAMEX> goes on
vacation, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson</ENAMEX> doesn't suddenly
become <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Tonight Show With Jay Leno</ENAMEX> . The task of a guest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> is
delicate. He has to be familiar (and competent) enough to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX>
satisfied, but also distinct (and flawed) enough that when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> returns,
everyone remembers exactly why they love him so. Similarly, when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> hold
hands in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, all our suspicions are confirmed.

            OK, that's not the least bit similar. These segues
are harder than they look from where you're sitting.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> were simpering
and giggling for the press after their <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90-minute</TIMEX> meeting at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">mansion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>. It was a love fest.

            "He is one of the real hopes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
Party has of regaining control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>," said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> in his
characteristic military style.

            "He's a good tough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">campaigner</ENAMEX>," the governor
reciprocated manfully.

            "I think I might have eaten a bad clam," said
someone, perhaps me.

            Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> would formally endorse the other, but
when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> if he'd specifically urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> to run,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> contorted his arm behind his back and said, "He twisted my ..." Well, you
