            Many of your suggestions
involved actions that, while amusing and cruel, are not illegal but merely
unlikely (Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> would be too scared to lift it while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> was in the
room.), unappetizing (With a human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">femur</ENAMEX>? Not in my copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joy</ENAMEX> of

and on the surface of the moon--but here on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>? I doubt it.). You know who
you are.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menem</ENAMEX> said he'd like to seek re-election, but his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s constitution
forbids <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> consecutive terms. In addition, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> amendment specifically
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prohibits Menem</ENAMEX> from running again. Former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ra√∫l Alfons√</ENAMEX>≠n thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menem</ENAMEX>
is just nuts, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menem</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfons√</ENAMEX>≠n should be ignored because "he couldn't
govern the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>."
