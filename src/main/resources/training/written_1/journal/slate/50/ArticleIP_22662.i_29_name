            Let other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>
travel the world in search of scoops. My story is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> and the living
room--and in the toilet. In researching this piece, I turned my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> into
a paper torture <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> as I compared the wiping power of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> brands of paper
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">towels</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> lines of facial tissues, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> types of toilet paper. Not all my
experiments were successful, and as I mop up the spills I can only hope that my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">landlady</ENAMEX> doesn't read 
                  Slate
               .

            Thanks to late-stage capitalism, the supermarket
shelves sag with scores of brands in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> categories. This is
not as daunting as it sounds, because the market is now dominated by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>: giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bounty, Charmin</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puffs</ENAMEX>), and three
other products of merger mania <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kimberly-Clark</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kleenex</ENAMEX>, and Viva),
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coronet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sparkle</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Angel Soft</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fort James</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brawny</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quilted Northern</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Green Forest</ENAMEX>). In picking the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contestants</ENAMEX> for this
survey I strove to find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> price points--premium,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">middle-of-the-road</ENAMEX>, and generic--and to give recycled and novelty products an
equal opportunity to impress.

            All paper--facial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, writing paper, newsprint--is created equal. What makes "sanitary
wiping paper" (to use the wonderful cadences of marketing-speak) stretchy and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absorbent</ENAMEX> is a process called "creping": A metal blade removes the paper as it
dries from the steel cylinder on which it was formed, lowering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX>. The premium wiping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> are also embossed, which creates pockets to
hold more "moisture." (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kimberly-Clark</ENAMEX>'s Web site boasts that "On the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX> only, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kleenex Cottonelle</ENAMEX> has
been given a unique, patented, gentle texture that is designed to give
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> a clean, fresh feeling." Apparently, we hardy <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">westerners</ENAMEX> don't
deserve such luxury.)

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P aper</ENAMEX> towels contain more
fibrous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pulp</ENAMEX>. This increases their strength, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> usually give
them more pronounced embossing for greater soaking power. Whereas little girls
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> appear on toilet paper wrappers, paper towel packages depict beefy,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brawny</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX>, indicating their toughness. In this category the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contestants</ENAMEX>
were:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Premium</ENAMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Envision Preference</ENAMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural Value</ENAMEX>

            To see if the towels really could provide the
implied strength and security, I tested the ability of a single sheet to hold
the moisture produced when a damp <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> bag was left on it for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two minutes</TIMEX>.
Unfortunately for me and my security deposit, none of my towels succeeded. I
didn't have any of the blue liquid ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> use in commercials to indicate
absorbency, so I gauged the soaking power of individual sheets with tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
Absorbency varied little as I poured <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a quarter-cup</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> onto towel after
towel. Not a single one could hold all the fluid, but even the cheapest towel
stayed solid as it was wrung out and used to wipe up the excess from the
counter.

            These tests convinced me
that while paper towels can't perform miracles, even the lowliest
example of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> can soak up liquid and dry your hands. If you're
faced with a big, messy job, it might be worth spending the extra money for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">premium</ENAMEX> product such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bounty Rinse & Reuse</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kleenex Viva Job Squad</ENAMEX> but,
under normal circumstances, a budget recycled product such as the ones on offer
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural Value</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Nature</ENAMEX> offer good value and provide the desired
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">durability</ENAMEX>.

            
I drew the line at catching a cold for this
story and instead subjected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> brands of facial tissues to a "spray
test." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contestants</ENAMEX> were:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Premium</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purely Cotton</ENAMEX>

            Puffs

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Middle-of-the-Road</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage Hearth</ENAMEX> (my
local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store brand</ENAMEX>)

            
               Recycled
            

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Seventh</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generation 2-Ply Facial Tissue</ENAMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Envision Preference</ENAMEX>
Ultra

            Using a squirt bottle, I simulated a big, soggy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sneeze</ENAMEX> to test their absorbency. To my amazement, all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> survived the
soaking. While absorbency did not vary, the softness factor is significant--the
downright decadence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kleenex ColdCare</ENAMEX> range makes everything else seem
almost abrasive. (And ply--the number of layers of paper in the product--isn't
everything, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Envision Preference Ultra</ENAMEX> is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-ply "premium" product, but it
still feels like a scouring pad after touching a virgin fiber tissue.) Thicker
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> also keep germs off your hands, which is nothing to sneeze at.

            You'll come to no harm
if you use tissues as lavatory paper, but your plumbing might--while the
strengthening cellulose <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> they contain are biodegradable, facial tissues
don't break down as quickly as toilet tissue, so flushing is not recommended.
If you're cold-free, you almost certainly don't need the mattressy softness of
an ultra brand (and you can't clean your spectacles with the aloed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hankies</ENAMEX>).

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are sheet scared of running out of
toilet tissue --the average family stash of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> rolls doesn't even take
Y2K hoarding into account. Scanning the supermarket shelves, there's a vast
price difference between the budget brands and the premium products, but are
the latter worth the extra? The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contestants</ENAMEX> were:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Premium</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ultra Soft Quilted Northern</ENAMEX>

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Seventh</NUMEX> Generation

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novelty Papers</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purely Cotton</ENAMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cottonelle Moist Wipes</ENAMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Label</ENAMEX>

            I didn't conduct any
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fiendish</ENAMEX> experiments on loo paper--I figured that the product's purpose is
specific enough that a trial "in the field" would tell me all I needed to know.
All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contestants</ENAMEX> went through the rotation in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX>. For novelty value, I
also tried <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cottonelle Moist Wipes</ENAMEX>, which offer "a fresher clean than with
bathroom tissue alone." The packaging promised that that I'd "feel cleaner,
more refreshed, and confident," but somehow using the adult equivalent of baby
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wipes</ENAMEX> failed to enhance my self-esteem. In the interests of internationalism, I
imported a package of "smooth" <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Blue Label</ENAMEX> toilet paper--the medicated, waxy
retro-wipe so beloved of government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>--from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>. It's a harsh wipe
and seems completely unsuited for contact with one's soft bits, but drape a
sheet of it over a comb and it makes a wonderful kazoolike musical
instrument.

            The latest marketing angle in toilet tissue is the double
or triple roll. There doesn't appear to be any agreement on what constitutes a
standard roll--so-called double rolls measure anywhere from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">187 square feet</NUMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">280 square feet</NUMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charmin</ENAMEX> triple roll is a giant <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">462 square feet</NUMEX> (though
we're assured it "fits almost all standard dispensers"). The implied economies
don't pan out--in my local supermarket the perfectly adequate single-roll store
brand (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage Hearth</ENAMEX>) was considerably cheaper per square foot than any of
the double or triple rolls (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only half</NUMEX> the price of the most expensive premium
brand I tried, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kleenex Cottonelle Ultrasoft Double Roll</ENAMEX>), and it doesn't take
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up as much</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> in my Y2K <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">storeroom</ENAMEX>.

            Recycled toilet tissues
have improved since the sandpaperlike sheets of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early '80s</TIMEX>, but they just
can't compete on the softness front. The recycled ingredients include rough
stuff like cardboard boxes as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office paper</ENAMEX>. Still, the case for
recycling is persuasive. The packaging for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Seventh Generation</ENAMEX> toilet paper
claims that "[i]f every household in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> replaced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> roll of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>
sheet virgin fiber bathroom tissues with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> recycled ones, we could save:
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">297,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.2 million cubic feet</NUMEX> of landfill space, equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,400</NUMEX> full
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">garbage</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">122 million gallons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>'s supply for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,500</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>." Since most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> get through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 to 55</NUMEX> rolls of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TP</ENAMEX> per
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, that's a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, trash, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.

            The mainstream brands base their sales pitches on
descriptors such as "gentle," "plush," and "cottony softness," but although
names such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cottonelle</ENAMEX> trade on the image of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX>, the products are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wood</ENAMEX>-based, whereas <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative newcomer</ENAMEX> to the market is actually made from
the fluffy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Purely Cotton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX> and facial tissues are made from
"cotton <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linter</ENAMEX>"--what's left over when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> and cottonseed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> have been
harvested. As a byproduct, cotton <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linter</ENAMEX> is considered <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 percent</NUMEX>
recycled/recovered and, although it is bleached to make it snowy white, the
process doesn't produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dioxins</ENAMEX> as with wood pulp <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bleaching</ENAMEX>.

            After my experiments, I'll probably stick with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Purely Cotton</ENAMEX>, which costs no more than the premium brands, is environmentally
sound, acceptably soft, and appropriately absorbent. Even the cheapest toilet
paper gets the job done, so if you want to impress <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> or if you don't want
to keep paper hankies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX>, buy the expensive stuff, but I'll bet
your delicate bits won't notice the difference.
