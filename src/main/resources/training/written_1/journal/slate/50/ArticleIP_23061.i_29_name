            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cowper</ENAMEX>, an <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18 th</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Protestant</ENAMEX>, may be best known for tormented, eloquent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poems</ENAMEX> of religious fervor
and despair. Apparently, he was convinced that he was already damned to
hell.

            This poem about his not
very nice but beloved pet rabbit, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tiney</ENAMEX>, is funny and charming, but those
qualities do not divorce the poem from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cowper</ENAMEX>'s intense melancholy and dread.
The poem is about death and comfort, and it demonstrates the genuineness of its
humility by its careful attention to details. The straightforwardness and
smiling directness are sad, temperate, heartfelt, and moving, as well as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">droll</ENAMEX>.

            Here lies,
whom hound did ne'er pursue,

            Nor swifter greyhound
follow,
Whose foot ne'er tainted, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> dew,

            Nor ear heard huntsman's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hallo'</ENAMEX>,

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Tiney</ENAMEX>, surliest of his kind,

            Who, nursed with tender
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>,
And to domestic bounds confined,

            Was still a wild
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jack</ENAMEX>-hare.

Though duly from my hand he took

            His pittance every
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>,
He did it with a jealous look,

            And, when he could, would
bite.

His diet was of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheaten bread</ENAMEX>,

            And <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oats</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">straw,</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Thistles</ENAMEX>, or lettuces instead,

            With sand to scour his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maw</ENAMEX>.

On twigs of hawthorn he regaled,

            On <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pippins</ENAMEX>' russet
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peel</ENAMEX>;
And when his juicy salads failed,

            Sliced carrot pleased him
well.

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> carpet was his lawn,

            Whereon he loved to
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bound,</ENAMEX>
To skip and gambol like a fawn,

            And swing his rump
around.

His frisking was at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening hours</TIMEX>,

            'For then he lost his
fear;
But most before approaching showers,

            Or when a storm drew
near.

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Eight years</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> round-rolling moons

            He thus saw steal
away,
Dozing out all his idle noons,

            And <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX> at
play,

I kept him for his humor's sake,

            For he would oft
beguile,
My heart of thoughts that made it ache,

            And force me to a
smile.

But now, beneath this walnut-shade

            He finds his long, last
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>,
And waits in snug concealment laid,

            Till gentler <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puss</ENAMEX> shall
come,

He, still more aged, feels the shocks

            From which no care can
save,
And, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> once of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiney</ENAMEX>'s box,

            Must soon partake his
grave.
