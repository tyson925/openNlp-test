            There
are a lot of "chills" about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>, the greatest being the chill between
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>'s massive theft of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> nuclear
secrets. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX> report dominated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> as
they assessed the deteriorating state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> relations. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South China Morning</ENAMEX>
Post implied that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox</ENAMEX> found nothing of importance that wasn't already
known. It has been known for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> has the ability to unleash
nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> and that it regards this as integral to its policy on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> said in an editorial. "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> hopes to regain sovereignty over the
island by peaceful means, but will not rule out invasion as a last resort," it
added. "Under certain circumstances, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX> probably would help to defend
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> rather than let its free-market democracy be taken by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. That is
where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nuclear-armed intercontinental missiles</ENAMEX> come in. This does not
mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> intends to start a nuclear war. But it clearly wants a more
credible missile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. After the alarms die down, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sino</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> relations may
get back on track. However, the changing missile equation will make that more
complicated than ever."

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> wasn't spared criticism in the affair. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sydney Morning Herald</ENAMEX> in an
editorial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> said it was "futile to blame the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> for a problem that
would not be as potentially serious if the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> themselves had been more
careful." "Most of all, it would be disastrous--especially at this time of
undeniably chillier relations between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>--to lose sight of the
larger guarantee of security that comes from the present policy course, of
engagement with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, through trade, diplomacy and dialogue," it added. In
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial</ENAMEX>
Times editorial said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has made itself an easy target
for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>'s ambitious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spies</ENAMEX> because of security failings that "are just the
latest symptoms of a deep muddle over the direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> policy towards
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>." "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX> needs to be straight with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> said. "That means
being consistently tough on security and positive on trade. ...Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
shows precious little sign of the political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> needed for the
task."

            The
Independent
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX> report exposed "an almost inconceivably sloppy attitude"
to security by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and showed "how difficult the West now finds
it to deal with an economically and politically resurgent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>." With <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>'s
acquisition of the latest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> technology, the assumption that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> will remain the world's only superpower "can no longer be so easily
held," it said. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Independent</ENAMEX> concluded that "with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> must
be fair but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> is not to begin with a cold snap."

            
Another chill set in between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, where the newspaper
Dawn led <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s putting its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> on "full alert" and announcing its right to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retaliate</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> launched airstrikes on disputed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kashmir</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
press was more interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonia Gandhi</ENAMEX>'s withdrawal of her resignation from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress Party</ENAMEX>, which she had made when some party
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> attacked her for being <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> born. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> 
               of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>
said her reinstatement has given the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> "a fresh lease of life" and has set
the stage "for what is going to prove a bitter, divisive and issueless
election."

            Yet
another chill was between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muammar Qaddafi</ENAMEX>,
failed to greet <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hosni Mubarak</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> when he flew to
visit him in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Libyan</ENAMEX> coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sirte Monday</TIMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan-Arab</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al-Quds al-Arabi</ENAMEX> described this as a "deliberate" snub linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>'s
refusal to join other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">member states</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization of African Unity</ENAMEX> (OAU)
in defying the air embargo that was in force against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years</TIMEX>
until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> handed over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lockerbie</ENAMEX> bombing suspects
for trial by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaddafi</ENAMEX> sent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenants</ENAMEX> to receive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mubarak</ENAMEX> while he waited for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> in
his tent "not very far from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al-Quds al-Arabi</ENAMEX> noted. Taken
aback by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaddafi</ENAMEX>'s absence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mubarak</ENAMEX> stated that he was on a
"brotherly"--meaning unofficial--visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> said.

            
Another icy chill is between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buckingham Palace</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tabloid</ENAMEX> the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> . There's another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> royal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">wedding next month</TIMEX>--of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward</ENAMEX>,
the Queen's youngest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie Rhys-Jones</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> who looks spookily
similar to both the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jill Dando</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s most
popular TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presenter</ENAMEX>, who was recently murdered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>,
Rhys-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> was portrayed topless in a "world exclusive picture" in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s mass-circulation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tabloid</ENAMEX>. It was a snap taken <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 10 years ago</TIMEX>
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rhys-Jones</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> and working in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> radio station. She was in
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mates</ENAMEX> on their way to an outside broadcast location in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> when the disc jockey beside her pulled up her bikini top and their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">companion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kara Noble</ENAMEX>, a radio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presenter</ENAMEX>, took a picture of her with a breast
exposed.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> called it a
bit of "sexy fun," but the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tabloids</ENAMEX> reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rhys-Jones</ENAMEX> felt
"devastated and betrayed." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Evening</ENAMEX>
Standard splashed the word "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cruelty</ENAMEX>" on its front page, which was how
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buckingham Palace</ENAMEX> has described it, and reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> has paid
Noble a sum "well in excess" of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$160,000</NUMEX> for the photograph, which has been
syndicated throughout the world. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evening Standard</ENAMEX> said in an
editorial that "having an image like this pushed in one's face makes it a bit
harder to keep the stardust sparkling in the prospect of a live televised
fairy-tale wedding at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windsor</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</TIMEX>." Another widely reported royal story
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> was that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diana Memorial Fund</ENAMEX>, set up to support her favorite
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX>, is spending <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $48,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> fighting an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> legal
action--the same sum it receives in donations from the public each month. The
legal case, due to be heard in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next March</TIMEX>, is against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franklin</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mint</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> of a popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Diana</ENAMEX> doll. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fund</ENAMEX> claims that the doll
infringes its intellectual property rights. In an editorial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, the
Times of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> called for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX> to be wound up, since "it is now
little more than a litigating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> exploiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> brand name."
