            The war in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX>
continued to eclipse all other news across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian of London</ENAMEX> leading its front page: "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day 21</TIMEX>: more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bombs</ENAMEX>, more death, more despair." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> said the war "showed ominous signs
of widening" with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serb</ENAMEX> incursion into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Albania</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tabloids</ENAMEX>, though, the dominant war issue was rape. "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rape Factory</ENAMEX>" was the
main front-page headline in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> , which added the rider, "Slobba
sinks to a new evil." "The rape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>" was a headline in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily</ENAMEX>
Mail .

            The reports were based
on a statement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Foreign</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Cook</ENAMEX> that young
ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Albanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are being herded into an army <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> and
subjected to systematic rape by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>. In the London
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evening Standard</ENAMEX> , conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Roberts</ENAMEX>
warned against the demonization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX>, because it would
increase his support among the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX>. He is, of course, "a vicious, ruthless
tyrant, but so are many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the world whom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nato</ENAMEX> has chosen not to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>.
To equate him with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX>, who really did threaten the West in a way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>
never could, can only flatter and strengthen him."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily Express</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> splashed an exclusive report on its front page that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Conservative</ENAMEX>
Party had received "substantial" donations in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> election from a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX>-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> with close links to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two</TIMEX> payments of
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $14,500</NUMEX> each were made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metalchem International</ENAMEX>, "a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>-registered
metal trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> which was under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> sanctions and remains on a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> blacklist because of its financial ties with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX>." In an editorial, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Express</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Conservative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> should "immediately and without
question repay to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metalchem</ENAMEX> or to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> the money they
gave."

            In other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> press
editorials <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, the conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily Mail</ENAMEX> said that "public
opinion is swinging in favor of an invasion" and that "the launch of a ground
offensive seems likelier <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>"; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> "that it may take
ground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>, backed by massive air power, to drive them [the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>]
out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>"; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily Telegraph</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair</ENAMEX> should rapidly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sanction</ENAMEX> "the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nato</ENAMEX> ground offensive that would be required to bring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX> to
heel"; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian</ENAMEX> that the West was sending a signal to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX>
"that ground action is becoming an available option for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nato</ENAMEX>, should the air
campaign bring no acceptable result, but that an opportunity remains for
settlement before a decision on ground action is made." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX> , on the other
hand, devoted an editorial to the argument that "the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> should engage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russia</ENAMEX>
more. That means accepting more than a token <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> presence in the
international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">force</ENAMEX> that may accompany the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>. Failure to
do this risks turning a split over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX> into another cold war."

            Meanwhile, a report in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Independent</ENAMEX> said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> might offer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iraqi</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kurds</ENAMEX> full military protection against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> if they allowed
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> opposition to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> itself in the area they control. The story quoted
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoshyar Zibari</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kurdistan Democratic Party</ENAMEX>, which controls
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">western Kurdistan</ENAMEX>, as saying, "We would need to have a no-fly, no-drive zone
protecting our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> retaliation if we were to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-operate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opposition</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> are "seriously
considering" the matter, he claimed.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iceland</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">daily</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgunbladid</ENAMEX> reported
that a plan to sail an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Icelandic Viking</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> as part of next
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>'s millennium celebrations is in jeopardy because lack of funding has
delayed the preparations. The original plan was for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> people
to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vlkingur</ENAMEX> , a replica of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Viking</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newfoundland</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, and to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> "to commemorate the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> anniversary of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leifur Eir√≠ksson</ENAMEX>'s discovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>." the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> said. But now, if the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">voyage</ENAMEX> goes ahead at all, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> will sail only to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Halifax</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX>. A
final decision will be made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish Times</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX> carried a front-page picture caption,
"The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> God omnipotent raineth on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fishamble Street</ENAMEX>." This was above
a picture of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Our Lady's Choral Society</ENAMEX> in pink raincoats and
waterproof hats trying to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">sing Handel's Messiah outdoors</ENAMEX> in a hail
shower. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> performance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Messiah</ENAMEX> was held in Fishamble
Street in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1742</TIMEX>.
