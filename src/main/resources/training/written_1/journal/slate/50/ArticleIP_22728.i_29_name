force feminist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theologian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Daly</ENAMEX> to admit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> into her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 years</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> has preached her brand of mystical feminism and revolution against the
patriarchy to an all-female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> stayed away, and those who
enrolled were assigned to a special section. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last fall</TIMEX>, a male student
enlisted the support of a conservative law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> and threatened to sue under
discrimination law after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> ejected him and another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> from her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX>.
Rather than admit the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to "Introduction to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feminist Ethics</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> took the
semester off, accused the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of "caving into right-wing pressure," and
refused the retirement package offered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesuit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Institutions</ENAMEX> find
themselves increasingly under legal scrutiny for supporting race and gender
preferences. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dartmouth College</ENAMEX> announced that it will no longer
tolerate single-sex policies at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fraternities</ENAMEX> and sororities, while
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radcliffe College</ENAMEX> said it would encourage more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to apply for its prestigious
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bunting Institute</ENAMEX> fellowships. Meanwhile, federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> continue to debate
whether the National Collegiate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athletic Association</ENAMEX> should be subject to
federal sex discrimination laws.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztlan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano Student Movement</ENAMEX>) took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,500</NUMEX> university <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> books hostage

asking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> to inaugurate a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> studies major, hire more

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia University</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">undergraduates</ENAMEX> wanted an ethnic studies major a couple of

campus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> without a staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> or approved adult in attendance; and
after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> suffered alcohol poisoning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> banned its annual Nude

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> snowfall. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> , the crackdowns represent
the biggest shift in campus social policy since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '60s</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> revolts
ushered in laissez-faire attitudes. Both ends of the political spectrum seem to
favor the trend. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chronicle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Higher Education</ENAMEX> attributes the increase
enrollment at <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX>--up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 percent</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1990 and 1996</TIMEX>--partly
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' concerns about binge drinking and other behaviors at public
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>. Meanwhile, in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> op-ed, libertarian feminist Katie

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony A. Williams</ENAMEX>, wants to move the beleaguered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of the District of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> from its affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northwest Washington</ENAMEX> digs to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anacostia</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">District</ENAMEX>'s poorest and most isolated area. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>'s poor academic record
has made it a frequent target of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> but, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Williams</ENAMEX> still believes it can become a magnet for economic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> in its new location. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UDC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julius Nimmons Jr.</ENAMEX> worries that
the move will demoralize a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, which, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">District</ENAMEX> itself, is just
beginning to recover from a fiscal crisis. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> add that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">university</ENAMEX>'s current presence in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> gives many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Washingtonians</ENAMEX> a valuable
opportunity to leave their troubled neighborhoods behind.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Darnton</ENAMEX>, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> on the history of the book, predicts a long life for the medium in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Review of Books</ENAMEX> . The prophecies of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">'60s</TIMEX> media
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">guru Marshall McLuhan</ENAMEX> have not come to pass. In spite of the rise of television
and the Internet, we do not live in a "post-literate" civilization dominated by
"technological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>." Although the book remains uniquely portable, durable, and
an aesthetically satisfying means of conveying written information, there is
one corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gutenberg</ENAMEX> galaxy where print may be pass√©--the world of
scholarly publishing. The monograph, traditionally the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academic</ENAMEX>'s ticket
to tenure and promotion, has become too expensive for presses to produce or for
libraries to purchase. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darnton</ENAMEX> suggests that electronic publishing can change
not only the way scholarly work is disseminated--online rather than in the
stacks--but also the shape of scholarship itself. The electronic book would
ideally be arranged "in layers, ... like a pyramid." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> could move from
basic information to complex analysis, from primary sources to ongoing debates.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Council of Learned Societies</ENAMEX>
have committed funds to the development of such books.

            Confessing a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>-long pattern of discrimination
against female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> is taking measures to cure
itself. In a report posted on the Web, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institute</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science</ENAMEX> documents entrenched if subtle discrimination against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in almost
every aspect of professional academic life from salaries and promotions to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committee</ENAMEX> work and office size. The report notes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>'s tenure rate
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> has stagnated at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 percent</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades</TIMEX> (the national average is
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26 percent</NUMEX>) and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women faculty</ENAMEX> were required to raise twice as much money
in outside grants as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. "I believe that in no case was this discrimination
conscious or deliberate," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Birgeneau</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dean</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School of Science</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birgeneau</ENAMEX> has promised increases in salary, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lab space</ENAMEX>, and research money to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women faculty</ENAMEX> and vowed to bring the number of tenured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> by
