            In "," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Gottlieb</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clive Crook</ENAMEX> before him,
thinks he has found a flaw in our argument that stocks are undervalued. He has
not. In a 
                  Slate
                "" <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Crook</ENAMEX> claimed that we were
contending that the value of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is the present value of its stream of
future earnings and that such a contention was false. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX>'s piece, in an
easy-to-follow way, demonstrates <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crook</ENAMEX>'s argument that, if you value a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> by
discounting its earnings, and all earnings are not paid out in dividends, then
you are double-counting.

            But the problem with what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crook</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX> are
saying is that we never based our theory on earnings but instead, as we
wrote in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> piece on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 17, 1999</TIMEX>, on the "money
a stock will put in your pockets through the profits generated by the company
that issued it." Neither in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>'s piece nor in our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 30, 1998</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> piece did we claim that all those profits--or
earnings--would go into your pockets. What we said explicitly was that the
proper figure to use to measure the cash generated by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> was somewhere
between the lower bound of the dividend that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> pays and the upper bound of
its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> after-tax earnings. Indeed, in our first piece we explicitly
highlighted the fact that earnings are a problematic measure of cash flow
because of the potential that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> might grow simply through retentions.

            But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crook</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX> are intelligent,
well-intentioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>. What led them astray? They both cite an argument
against our first piece raised by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeremy Siegel</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wharton School</ENAMEX>. He
claimed that it is a "mistake" to assume that dividends per share will post
real growth, as we did in our calculations, because dividends, in theory,
should only just keep up with inflation.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Crook</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX> appear to have been convinced
that real earnings growth only reflects retentions and that real dividend
growth must be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegel</ENAMEX>'s point fits the simplest introductory
economic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, it is contradicted by the facts: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Historical</ENAMEX> data on dividends
reveal significant real growth of dividends per share. For example, in the
latest edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegel</ENAMEX>'s excellent book Stocks for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Run</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-1</ENAMEX> on Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> shows that the growth of real dividends per share has been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX>
percent on average since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1946</TIMEX> and positive since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19 th century</TIMEX>.
(In our calculations, we assume <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.1 percent</NUMEX> real growth in dividends.)

            What <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crook</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX> say can't
happen--dividends growing faster than inflation--has been going on for almost
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">130 years</TIMEX>. Where has all this growth come from? We treat that question at
length in our book, relating the observation to theories at the frontier of the
branch of economics known as "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial Organization</ENAMEX>," but here is a hint: The
simplest textbook model of the perfectly competitive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> doesn't do a great
job of describing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that have driven the market higher and
higher.

            Discounting dividends is uncontroversial, and the
fact that they grow is clear. It is interesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX> says that, on the
strength of dividends alone, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> should be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 14,000</NUMEX> using our theory.
That is a good start. Even sticking with dividends alone, the number is pushed
considerably higher than that if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> accounts for repurchases and the tax
advantage associated with them. So much for the crazy stock market bubble. Dow
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14,000</NUMEX> is clearly a lower-bound estimate. Today, many enormous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> don't pay
dividends at all. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> have value because, ultimately, they will deliver
cash to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Crook</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX> think that all valuation
techniques are out the window for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> that don't pay dividends, but they are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misinformed</ENAMEX>. There is a very large peer-reviewed academic literature on this
topic. The basic idea is simple: You can base a value measure on earnings
instead of dividends if you can identify those things that you are
double-counting and make sure that you only count them once. For example,
earnings themselves are a reasonable measure of the dividend that you use to
construct the value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> if all earnings are paid out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. Such an
example is no pipe dream. Real <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estate Investment Trusts</ENAMEX>, for example, pay out
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 percent</NUMEX> of their earnings, and many of them post earnings growth well above
inflation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year after year</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> alone, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REITs</ENAMEX>, on average, are expected to
increase their earnings by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX>, with inflation at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 2 percent</NUMEX>. When
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> retain lots of earnings it gets more complicated, with the growth of
earnings increasing as more and more cash is retained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>. For those
who can't wait until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall release date</TIMEX> of our book Dow <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36,000</NUMEX> and
want to start thinking through these issues, check out the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Spring 1995</TIMEX> issue of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contemporary Accounting Research</ENAMEX> , which provides a number of
valuable review articles of the some of the relevant academic work.

            It is impossible to
address every conceivable objection in a short article in the Wall Street
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> or 
                  Slate
               , which is one reason we are writing our
book. We look forward to picking up this debate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall</TIMEX> when we lay all our
facts and arguments on the table. Until that time, we have a little homework
assignment for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX> and anyone else at 
                  Slate
                who would like
to try. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s earnings have grown at an average rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 25 percent</NUMEX>
annually over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 10 years</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> pays no dividends. Were all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s earnings consumed in running in place, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX>'s model
suggests? Should <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> be worth nothing since it doesn't pay an actual
dividend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>? Was the price increase over that period justified? What would a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fair</ENAMEX> price for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> be if the risk premium were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>? We look forward to
their answers.

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James K. Glassman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Hassett Washington</ENAMEX>

            
               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Gottlieb</ENAMEX>
replies:
                
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glassman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hassett</ENAMEX> write in to say I have
misrepresented their argument. They do not, they say, value a stock by looking
at future earnings. They even agree that this would be a big mistake. They
claim to look instead at future cash flows to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockholders</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
might want to reread their original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> article, which says: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Assume</ENAMEX>
that after-tax earnings are a reasonable estimate of the cash flow from a
stock." In other words, there is no difference between my description of their
argument and their own.
            

            
               Meanwhile, they have misrepresented my
argument. My article does not say or imply that "real earnings growth only
reflects retentions and that dividend growth must be zero" or that "all
valuation techniques are out the window for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> that don't pay dividends." It
simply asserts that, in calculating a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>'s potential value, you can't assume
that earnings are simultaneously retained and paid out--and that the
Glassman-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hassett</ENAMEX> argument depends on precisely these conflicting assumptions.
The argument is fallacious whether all the earnings are paid out, all are
retained, or anything in between.
            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glassman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hassett</ENAMEX> now claim that they will
sort out the components of retained earnings to avoid double-counting in their
forthcoming book. I look forward to it. But I boldly predict it won't work
unless they have an entirely new thesis, since double-counting of corporate
earnings is the core of their current <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. The thesis is simply wrong and
cannot be refined into sense. What's more, double-counting of all corporate
earnings is how they get the figure in their title-- Dow <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36,000</NUMEX> --so
that will have to go if they even start down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Refinement Road</ENAMEX>.
            

            
               It's obvious that
our discussion must rest until this ambitious book is published. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">right now</TIMEX>,
it is worth noting that this letter is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glassman</ENAMEX> and
Hassett have explicitly admitted that equating earnings and dividends is a
mathematical sin. They refer to it as "double-counting," which indeed it
is.
            

            
               Speaking With the
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Enemy</ENAMEX>"
            

            I've never read a more paranoid piece of writing
then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James J. Cramer</ENAMEX>'s "." At the risk of being lumped into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cramer</ENAMEX>'s "legion of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>," I thought it worth highlighting some of the absurdities in the
piece.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cramer</ENAMEX> writes that "[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TokyoMex</ENAMEX>'s] online following
... is much bigger than mine. And my record of giving good financial guidance,
publicly and privately, is better than his. So why the fuss over me while other
portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> write <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> about their stock picks and get no heat?"
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TokyoMex</ENAMEX>'s activities deserve notice, but it's ridiculous to say that his
following (via his own small Web site and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silicon Investor</ENAMEX> chat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>) is
bigger than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cramer's</ENAMEX> (whose thoughts have been distributed through not only
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TheStreet</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, but also ABCNEWS.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Morning America</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GQ</ENAMEX> ,
Yahoo! <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squawk Box , SmartMoney</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> , and Politically
Incorrect , among other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> properties with vast <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX>). TokyoMex may
be unsavory, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cramer</ENAMEX> just sets him up as a straw <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> to burn him. Just
because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cramer</ENAMEX> is more ethical than an infamous pump-and-dumpster doesn't mean
that his unusual position as both professional money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> and professional
financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX>--and yes, it is unusual--isn't deserving of scrutiny and
criticism. The dual role is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cramer</ENAMEX>'s gimmick, and more power to him for having
the energy to exploit the possibilities inherent in straddling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> worlds. I
find his columns entertaining more often than not. But his situation isn't
common, so the argument of "everyone does it, why pick on me?" isn't
relevant.

            Then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cramer</ENAMEX> says, "I don't write for the money, and
I don't write for the notoriety, so giving them up wouldn't hurt." If it's
true, then give up your <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250,000</NUMEX> salary and your stock options in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TheStreet</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, stop writing about your personal life in your musings, and
remove the iconic projection of yourself from your Web site. You don't have to
stop providing the insights that only you can give to the ignorant investing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> in order to forgo the money and fame that come along with your position.
And, frankly, you shouldn't have to. But do us all the favor of not acting like
you're just being noble.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cramer</ENAMEX> continues, "[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>]here is no difference between
a portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> who recommends stocks in an interview to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> ... and
a portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> who recommends stocks in a column of his own." Say what?
Extending that logic, there's no difference between a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> that promotes
its policies to an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> that runs its own
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> scenarios <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cramer</ENAMEX> describes conflates the
interested role of the portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> with the presumably disinterested role
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX>. Don't tell me there aren't ethical challenges in that beyond
those posed by the first scenario.

            Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cramer</ENAMEX> writes, "The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> who would
stop me are complicit with that ignorance and are willing tools of those that
would like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> to have to rely on those who charge high commissions or
high fees to unknowing, worried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> of finance." This is a low blow. The
general tone of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cramer</ENAMEX>'s piece is dismissive of financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> (or at
least those who would criticize him) as know-nothings or, worse, conspirers
with the dark <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of the finance industry. But I've read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Abelson</ENAMEX> (the
only "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cramer</ENAMEX> refers to by name) off-and-on since I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> got interested
in investing, and whatever else he is, he isn't a "tool" of the industry. Nor
are the vast majority of financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>. Sure, there are some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hacks</ENAMEX>, but
most are intelligent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> who have the interests of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> at the top
of their agenda. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cramer</ENAMEX> notes that if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> don't find his writing worthy,
he will "disappear from the writing firmament." Well, isn't that what would
happen to the "established" business press that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cramer</ENAMEX> so disdains, if his
accusations were even partly true?

            I really do like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TheStreet</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> and 
                  Slate

Morningstar, whose site at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morningstar</ENAMEX>.net is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX> to

reflect well on your publication or his. 
                  Slate
                has been
(unwittingly?) caught in the cross-fire that has been going on for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX>
between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Abelson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James Cramer</ENAMEX>. It would have been better if your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> had dispatched the enviably good <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Surowiecki</ENAMEX> to cover the feud, or
if you had invited the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duke</ENAMEX> it out in a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dialogue</ENAMEX>." Luckily, I don't
have to cancel my subscription to your zine in a fit of pique!

perpetuates an old shibboleth when he mentions <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>'s "safe, legal, and

his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>'s suspicious activities was the right choice. Nonetheless, few of
us would want to face that decision ourselves--even if we are confident that we
would have chosen similarly. Not all moral choices are painless. One can want a
particular practice to be rare just because it is painful, even if it is
morally required (and not just permissible). So there is no contradiction in
wanting abortions to be safe, legal, and rare.

               This rejoinder employs
faulty logic. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> involvement in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> was a good thing and, hopefully,
not rare. I would hope that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> would defend itself every time a

good thing in informing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> of evidence bearing on his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>'s guilt was
also not a rare thing. I would hope that every time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaczynski</ENAMEX>, or anybody else
for that matter, discovers that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> of his is an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalist</ENAMEX>
extremist bent on murdering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, that he will inform the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> of this
evidence. If abortion, like defending oneself against fascists and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalist murderers</ENAMEX>, is a good thing, than it should not be rare. Good
behavior should never be rare. It should be routine.

            I have great respect and admiration for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshall</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loeb</ENAMEX> (that's not a throwaway line; I really do), but his explanation that he
was getting paid by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> , not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX>, is kind of funny (see
"Culturebox: "). Imagine how 
                  Slate
                and others would slice me up
if you found out I was running a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> about journalism--one that some call
a "watchdog"--and was getting paid writing assignments from one of the
organizations I was supposed to be watching and, of course, not disclosing it
on the pages of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> whenever the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> writes about that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>. You'd probably even get a great quote from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> saying how
troubled he is by it. Might they cancel future assignments if a piece in the
magazine really stings them? Might they add on assignments if a piece
celebrates them? Mightn't it all just look bad even if everyone behaves
honestly?

            For you to let that
explanation go uncommented on was surprising. Seems to me that getting paid by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> , as opposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> whom the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Journalism</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review</ENAMEX> is not nearly as likely to be covering, is a bigger issue.
