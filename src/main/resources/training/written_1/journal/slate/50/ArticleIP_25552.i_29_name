Wrap-Up
            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> has rednecks,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> has rubes, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> has vapidity, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> has violence, and
foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz</ENAMEX> has affirmed these truths time and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> again. But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>? Well, there's a heroic fictional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boxer</ENAMEX> and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of less heroic nonfictional baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>. But mostly there are the
Amish, a source of amusement not only because they eschew modern conveniences
(with the exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rollerblades</ENAMEX> and hard <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, if I have that right) but
also because they are so unfathomably beneficent, at least among themselves.
Real <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, of course--whether from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> or, especially,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX>--would rather be dead than altruistic. And even dead, the most
we can promise is we'll consider it.

            Under a new program, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> organ
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> will be eligible to receive <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300</NUMEX> toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>' funeral expenses.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">394</NUMEX> altruistic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennsylvanians</ENAMEX> donated organs; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> needed
them. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> pays for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> of a hardwood casket with your

            As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Sparkman</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware Valley Transplant Program</ENAMEX> notes, the plan is controversial, but
perhaps less so than the one it replaces. You see, I once knew a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who had a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> picked up a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> on a business trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lancaster</ENAMEX>. The next
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> he woke up in a bathtub full of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> surgical scar in his
side. Written in lipstick on the mirror was the message, "Welcome to the world
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>. Now go home." It was signed, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Amish</ENAMEX>."

            Recently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSNBC</ENAMEX> Web

(alleged) <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> war criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arkan</ENAMEX>. In one of those glitches we've come to
expect from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> sites, the two chat sessions got hopelessly jumbled. Or
at least they might have. Here are actual questions posed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX>, paired with
genuine answers to different questions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arkan</ENAMEX>. Both have been edited, but

peace and love, we are not fighting for war.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Q</ENAMEX>: Is Dilbert
idea evolving with time and where is it heading now? I mean what is the
next move you think?

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Q</ENAMEX>: I wish you'd remove
the animal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> and replace them with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, I could relate much
easier.
            

            A: I
really don't give a damn.
