Wrap-Up
            

            Not motivated by what's
to come but by the fear of being left out. Puts me in mind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boswell</ENAMEX>'s
description of what in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18 th century</TIMEX> was called a hypochodriack,
what we'd call a depressive:

            
               His opinion of himself is low and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">desponding</ENAMEX>. His temporary dejection makes his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculties</ENAMEX> seem quite feeble. He
imagines that everybody thinks meanly of him. ... He regrets his having ever
attempted distinction and excellence in any way, because the effect of his
former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exertions</ENAMEX> now serves only to make his insignificance more vexing to him.
... There is a cloud as far as he can perceive, and he supposes it will be
charged with thicker vapour the longer it continues. He is distracted between
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">indolence</ENAMEX> and shame. Every kind of labour is irksome to him. Yet he has not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX> to cease from his accustomed tasks. ... He acts therefore like a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">slave</ENAMEX>, not animated by inclination but goaded by fear.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Kirshbaum</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive</ENAMEX> of Time Warner
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX> publishing, said it about electronic books. He and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have to
deal with them, but they don't yet know what to think about them. (To find out
what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Weisberg</ENAMEX> thinks about them, click to go to his piece in

                  Slate
               .)

            One conflict: What
royalty are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> entitled to? Because electronic publishing eliminates
paper, printing, warehousing, and delivery, costs are lower, say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, so
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publishers</ENAMEX> should take a smaller share of a book's price, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>'s
share should increase. Not so, say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>, who insist they should continue
to take a whopping chunk of the money for no particular reason. Oh, yes:
Because they can.
