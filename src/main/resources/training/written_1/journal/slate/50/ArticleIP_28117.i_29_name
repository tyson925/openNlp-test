            Greetings, pissed-off <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>. It is I, the great
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping Avenger</ENAMEX>, who has toiled without pause <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past month</TIMEX> (all right, I
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paused</ENAMEX>) to right the wrongs inflicted on the buying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> by the dark forces
of turbocharged capitalism.

            Before writing the first installment of this column
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping Avenger</ENAMEX> had no idea that so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would have so
many complaints about so many different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping Avenger</ENAMEX> also
had no idea so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> read 
                  Slate
               . The complaints, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simpson</ENAMEX> would say, have come pouring in over the transom. I received somewhere
around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.7 million</NUMEX> e-mails from 
                  Slate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> asking for help in
the battle against poor customer service. Perhaps it was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 2.7</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX>, but not by much.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> correspondent
was hostile: "You're probably just running a scam to collect a bunch of upscale
e-mail addresses," he wrote, dyspeptically and inaccurately. I checked out his
e-mail address--it's not upscale at all.

            But most of you turned to me in good faith, and for this I
am thankful. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, I am but one superhero, and could not come to the aid of all
who beseeched me. So, for those of you asking highly technical questions
concerning the operation of your personal computers, let it be known across the
land that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping Avenger</ENAMEX> still writes on papyrus. And for those of you
who contributed not complaints but wacky observations, such as "I find it
amazing how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will drive many miles out of their way to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> that is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
cents cheaper," I thank you for your commentary.

            Now, though, a few observations of my own, about the
complaints (the understandable ones) I did receive.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> consumer believes that the telephone
is the instument of the devil.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who answer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-800</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lines</ENAMEX> are spawn of
the devil or, at the very least, incredibly thick.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) The typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> would much rather blow
smoke than actually apologize for doing wrong.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX>
do not yet understand the true power of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shopping Avenger</ENAMEX>.

            As an example of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> phenomena, I refer you now to the
complaint of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.</ENAMEX>, who is chagrined by the errant behavior of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-Haul</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.

            "I signed up a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
weeks hence," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.</ENAMEX> explains. "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A week later</TIMEX>, I called the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> to confirm,
and confirm they did: They confirmed that my reservation was for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>. Not
only was it not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fri</ENAMEX>.-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mon.</ENAMEX>, indeed, it couldn't be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fri</ENAMEX>.-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mon.</ENAMEX>, because
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-Haul</ENAMEX> policy is not to rent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than one weekend day</TIMEX>. ... <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, no
problem, a fine policy. But let's supplement it with: DON'T TELL ME OTHERWISE
WHEN I SIGN UP."

            Though I am not one to endorse the use of CAPITAL
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">LETTERS TO MAKE A POINT</ENAMEX>, I believe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K.</ENAMEX> earned that right here.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.</ENAMEX> goes on to state that he canceled his rental and
sought out a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ryder</ENAMEX>, where the saleswoman, an ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-Haul</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>, told
him that it was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-Haul</ENAMEX>'s policy never to turn down a reservation, no matter
what. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overbooking</ENAMEX> is the norm, she said.

            So, I called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-Haul</ENAMEX> to inquire about its rental
policies. What I got was, in technical terms, a runaround.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-Haul International</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johna Burke</ENAMEX>, told me that her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> would never behave in such a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>. Then she blamed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> for misunderstanding what he heard. This, I
am learning, is standard operating procedure across whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">industries</ENAMEX>: I've
heard variations of "the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> didn't understand our phone prompts" three
times already, leading me to the conclusion that there's a real problem out
there with deliberately obfuscatory phone prompts.

            Then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burke</ENAMEX> yelled at me for having the temerity to even
suggest that the ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-Haul employee K.</ENAMEX> quoted might be right. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenger</ENAMEX> can take the heat, however. I asked her for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-Haul</ENAMEX> policy
concerning weekend rentals, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burke</ENAMEX> said she could not cite policy, because
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individual U-Haul</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> set their own policies. She asked me to identify
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in which the rental was to occur, which I did. Then she suggested
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">that K.</ENAMEX> merely thought he made a reservation but actually only asked about
prices. This seemed a bit of a stretch to me, but I checked with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.</ENAMEX>, who
supplied me with his actual reservation number. He also confirmed that he
placed a deposit for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX>.

            Once again, I called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burke</ENAMEX> to ask whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-Haul</ENAMEX> is
in the habit of changing confirmed reservations behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customer</ENAMEX>'s back, but
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burke</ENAMEX>, even while knowing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping Avenger</ENAMEX>'s deadline approached, did
not call back.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping Avenger</ENAMEX> has himself been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> of
the reservation shuffle, and so he sympathizes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K.</ENAMEX>'s complaint. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K.</ENAMEX>
should know that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping Avenger</ENAMEX> will not rest, except at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">weekends</ENAMEX>, until he shakes an adequate explanation out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-Haul</ENAMEX>.

            But let us turn now to a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping Avenger</ENAMEX> victory.

            Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.</ENAMEX> wrote the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shopping Avenger</ENAMEX> to complain
of his treatment on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ticketmaster</ENAMEX> Web site. As he explained, he had logged
on to the site in order to buy tickets to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dylan-Paul Simon</ENAMEX> show.
Everything was going fine until he clicked to confirm his order. The screen
read, "We will now contact the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ticketmaster</ENAMEX> system to complete your order.
Please wait to see a response from the system with your confirmation."

            "I waited and waited," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.</ENAMEX> wrote me. "Finally, a
message appeared telling me to try later; the gateway was not functioning. ...
So there I was wondering what the hell had happened to my credit card
information. Even worse, the phone number they gave me to call is long
distance. Needless to say, this was frustrating. ... I picked up the phone and
called the long-distance number. It was busy. In fact, it was busy for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEXT</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">THREE</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">HOURS"</ENAMEX>--there are those capital letters again. "Even worse, when I
finally did get through, I was put on hold for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX>. Let me emphasize:
That was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> of my long distance, on MY phone bill, to find out what
they had done to MY credit card number."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX> then writes: "Ironically, while on hold,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ticketmaster</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shamelessly</ENAMEX> plugged its online system, finishing with, 'Buying
tickets has never been easier.' "

            Ironic indeed.

            To add insult to injury, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX> finally spoke to a "live"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> (you will soon see why the word "live" is in quotation marks), he asked
to have the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5.50</NUMEX> "convenience" fee waived for each ticket he planned to buy.
"After all, I was making a long-distance call and they had bungled my initial
attempt at a purchase."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX>, a certain "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nola</ENAMEX>" from the misnamed
"customer service" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>, told him he should have called his local service
provider. Of course, no one had provided <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX> with the local service number. He
eventually bought the tickets anyway, paying the "convenience" charge.

            All this was too much for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shopping Avenger</ENAMEX>, who
swung into action. Actually, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping Avenger</ENAMEX> swung into action even before
he knew of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX>'s plight, since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> had secretly forwarded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping Avenger</ENAMEX> complaint to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ticketmaster</ENAMEX>. Soon after I made inquiries, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX> was
refunded <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$11</NUMEX> in "convenience" charges.

            But <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$11</NUMEX> wasn't enough. I
wanted an explanation and an apology for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX>, which he got, sort of.

            In a letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX>, the executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ticketmaster Multimedia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Perkins</ENAMEX>, explains, semi-grammatically, that
"[w]hen tickets goes on-sale, it operates through telephone lines that may
become busy." He also explains, "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Dozens</NUMEX> of variables may determine the speed
and continuity of your Internet connection are in the hands of your local phone
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perkins</ENAMEX> does say he's sorry, in a fashion: "Please
accept our sincerest apologies and we hope you will continue to offer your
comments as our site evolves in the future."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX> can accept the nonsensical apology, he told me,
because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ticketmaster</ENAMEX> is also offering him a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> gift certificate for his
troubles. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ticketmaster</ENAMEX> has shown the way: When you screw up, apologize, make
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material amends</ENAMEX>, and get the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shopping Avenger</ENAMEX> on your side.

            Score that: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping Avenger</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$111</NUMEX>;
evil-but-contrite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Next month</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping Avenger</ENAMEX> hopes to focus on
the evils of the pest control and airline industries. Don't ask why, it's too
complicated to explain. If you have complaints about these industries--or any
other, for that matter--e-mail the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shopping Avenger</ENAMEX> (with as much detail as
possible) at shoppingavenger@slate.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>.
