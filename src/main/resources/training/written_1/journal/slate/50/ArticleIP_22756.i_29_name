Wrap-Up
            

            The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> coverage of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX> teaches this lesson: It's futile to
read the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>. Salient details are always concealed, key decisions are
always made in private, and the ink gets all over your hands. Review the
dailies from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1942 or 1929 or 1863</TIMEX>, and you'll come away with a similar
impressively false sense of the great events of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>. So why persist in
newspaper reading? For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing, it lets you participate in the ongoing
conversation that is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s culture. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> doesn't wish to stand silently by
while others merrily exchange misinformation about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Albania</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX>, and
computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">viruses</ENAMEX>. (That's why <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of decent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> watch <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Just Shoot</ENAMEX>
Me : It'll be the talk of the schoolyard <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>. Surely not because it is,
in any meaningful sense, good.) For another thing, the news provides a myth
system for a secular age, giving us figures of good and evil, around whom we
can construct tales of ... well, OK, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> of evil and more evil. But perhaps
the utility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>--their ability to provide truth and understanding--is
beside the point. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> buys them for other reasons: for powerful photographs,
now often in color, of underwear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>; for a chance encounter with an
embarrassing detail about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Perelman</ENAMEX>; and perhaps most of all, for that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lovable Marmaduke</ENAMEX> cartoon. At <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">60 cents</NUMEX>, it's a bargain!

            "A letter in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beatrix Potter</ENAMEX> reveals that one
of her best-loved fictional creations, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Squirrel Nutkin</ENAMEX>, was based on a pet
squirrel with behavioural problems is expected to fetch <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to Â£15,000</NUMEX> at
auction," reports <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathy Marks</ENAMEX>.

            Writing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1903</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> before the publication
of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Potter</ENAMEX> notes: "I bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> squirrels,
but the one called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nutkin</ENAMEX>--who was much the handsomest--was so very savage I
was obliged to take him back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>. So I have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> now, called
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twinkleberry</ENAMEX>."

            Some corrections from
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> :

            

               It was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice</ENAMEX>.

               He is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX>, not a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrat</ENAMEX>.

               He was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX>, not a lieutenant.

               It is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silbury Hill</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avebury</ENAMEX>.

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s name is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ninos Con Bombas</ENAMEX>, not Todos
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">los Manos</ENAMEX>.
