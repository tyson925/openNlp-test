            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>'s intervention in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> has made strange bedfellows among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niall Ferguson</ENAMEX> scoffs at the campaign's inadequacy in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">op-ed</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Bleeding Hearts and Bloody Messes</ENAMEX>"). Elsewhere, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> of the

and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noam Chomsky</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Magnus Enzensberger</ENAMEX>, who <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> arming the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kosovo Liberation Army</ENAMEX>, begs to differ: "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> themselves are not merely
capable of intervening [in this conflict], we are morally obligated to do so."
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Novelist GÃ¼nter Grass</ENAMEX> supports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> campaign and regrets only that it did

denounces the hypocrisy he sees in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX> demonstrations against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>
bombs. "In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX>," he writes, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are defiantly dancing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>
while <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 kilometers</NUMEX> to the south, a genocide of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> proportions is taking

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Davis</ENAMEX> has proposed community service as a requirement for graduating from the

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monterey Bay</ENAMEX> already gives <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> course credit for performing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two semesters</TIMEX>
of mandatory public service. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maryland</ENAMEX> was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to require community
service from its high-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, following the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s
emphasis on public service in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early '90s</TIMEX>. Who could object to such
civic-mindedness? In response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>' objections, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayn Rand Institute</ENAMEX>
offers an internship of its own: Participating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> earn their community

               This Class Is
Rated "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>"
            

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Arizona</ENAMEX>
student who enrolled in a class called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Women in Literature</ENAMEX>" was dismayed to
discover that the class addressed gay and lesbian issues. As a result, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX> is now considering warning labels for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> with
potentially "objectionable" content. Says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona Regents</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy</ENAMEX>
Gignac, "The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> are our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> and they are paying to be taught. They
need to know in advance what it is they're paying for." Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> of such
course labels have suggested classes be rated like TV programs--but, Gignac
points out, "that might increase enrollment in some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX>" with particularly
racy ratings.

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Holocaust</ENAMEX>
            

            Is there a difference
between denying the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> scholarship and denying the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX>
itself? One might think so. But when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commentary Senior</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabriel Schoenfeld</ENAMEX> published scathing attacks on the kitschiness and
obscurity of contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> scholarship in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Commentary</ENAMEX> and in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , he found out otherwise. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Feinstein</ENAMEX>, acting
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust and Genocide Studies</ENAMEX> at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Minnesota</ENAMEX>, wrote on an e-mail discussion list that Schoenfeld
"has done as much damage as deniers." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franklin Littell</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizer</ENAMEX>
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> studies conference, accused <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schoenfeld</ENAMEX> of "subtle denial." In
response, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schoenfeld</ENAMEX> says, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Littell</ENAMEX> is not merely using vicious rhetoric

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX>
Revolution
            

            On the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>
anniversary of the liberation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>, we often refer to that event
in shorthand as the "fall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Berlin Wall</ENAMEX>." But should we refer instead to
"the beginning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> round-table negotiations"? The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> thinks so, and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 9</TIMEX>, it gathered an array of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissidents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> to make the case. Most of the conference
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">attendees</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solidarity</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam Michnik</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Kwasniewski</ENAMEX>,
participated in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> talks that led to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solidarity</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. At the
conference, they defended their activities against numerous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solidarity</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> denied they made too many compromises; priests
denied they had been co-opted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX> denied they had
committed treason. "We were not servile to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>," said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>'s
last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX>, "we were helpless before that huge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>."
Several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> had planned to protest the conference, upset
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> was paying to put former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> up in fine
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>. In fact, the protests did not occur.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Mason University</ENAMEX>
has dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star runners</ENAMEX> from the track <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> for the wrongful use of

the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> , assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Showers</ENAMEX> allowed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> members

long-distance personal calls from his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. After a routine audit of the
departmental phone bill, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GMU</ENAMEX> discovered the calls and found them to be in
violation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCAA</ENAMEX> rules intended to curb recruitment abuses. Even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCAA</ENAMEX>
allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> to regain their eligibility by reimbursing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GMU</ENAMEX>'s athletic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> has decided they will not run with the team this

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">philosopher Voltaire</ENAMEX> and declaring his vision of racially segregated societies
to be based on "good science." The endorsement--along with the revelation that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX> has quietly pursued race-based research for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</TIMEX>--has provoked a
furor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSU</ENAMEX>, which has the second-highest number of black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> among the
