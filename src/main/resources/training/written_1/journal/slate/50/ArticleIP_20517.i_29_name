<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aired Juanita Broaddrick</ENAMEX>'s accusation that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> forced himself
on her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 years ago</TIMEX>. The segment examined problems in her story: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) She said
"no" at first but later stopped resisting; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) she didn't report the crime; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
she can't remember when it happened; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) she filed an affidavit in the Paula
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> case denying she had been assaulted. Her explanations: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) she was
"panicky"; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) she was "in denial"; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) she thought "it was my fault"; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) "I
didn't think anyone would believe me." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> denies the allegation,
but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> refuses to say where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> was on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> in question.
The spins: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broaddrick</ENAMEX> has no motive to lie. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) But she ruined her
credibility by changing her story twice. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) Her credibility can't be as bad as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) What's scary is that the allegation is plausible. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>
are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cowards</ENAMEX> for ignoring it. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cowards</ENAMEX> for secretly using it
as a basis for their impeachment votes. (For more on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broaddrick</ENAMEX> spins, see

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> received the death penalty for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chaining</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> Byrd
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jr.</ENAMEX> to a pickup <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> and dragging him to his death. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> would be the first
white executed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> for killing a black since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1850s</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> black rejected the defense's argument that poor conditions in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prisons</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> had served time had caused his racism.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Optimists</ENAMEX> and pessimists debated whether the case showed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the persistence of
racial violence or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2</NUMEX>) a growing resolve to prosecute it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Liberals</ENAMEX> debated
whether the sentence was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) bad because the death penalty is always wrong or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2</NUMEX>)
good because the death penalty has been applied in a racially discriminatory
manner. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2/26/99</NUMEX>)
            

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>,

about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> racial murder . Shock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jock</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tracht</ENAMEX> played a song by a black
hip-hop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> and then joked, "No wonder <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> drag them behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX>."
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Listeners</ENAMEX> and black radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> protested and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tracht</ENAMEX> apologized, but his
station fired him, saying it "cannot be associated with the trivialization of
an unspeakable act of violence." The spins: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) He's a good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ</ENAMEX> who made a "slip
of the tongue." <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) He's a racist who joked on the air in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martin</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luther King Jr.</ENAMEX>'s birthday, "Kill <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> more and we can take a whole week off."
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) The scandal is that only a comment this offensive can get a shock jock
fired. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2/26/99</NUMEX>)
            

            
Radical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">feminist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Daly</ENAMEX> refused to let <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male students</ENAMEX> enroll in

offered to teach male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> separately, but having them in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> would dampen debate among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) one of the male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> was
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservative</ENAMEX> who was just trying to score a political point. The college
administration, citing gender equality law, told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> to admit the male
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> or stop teaching. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> is taking a leave of absence in the hope that
the dispute will blow over. She accuses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> of "caving in to right-wing
pressure and depriving me of my right to teach freely and depriving [female

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Independent Counsel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX> agreed to work together in

recap: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX> decided to launch an inquiry into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s conduct in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> case. Then a conservative legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> asked the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> who had
appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> to intervene. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> to file briefs
on whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX> had authority to launch the inquiry. The conservative spin:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX> is conspiring with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>. The liberal spin: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> is
conspiring with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> and the conservative legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to hide their
conspiracy to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. The cynical spin: Let's get rid of the independent

recessed until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 15</TIMEX>. The scenarios, in order of ascending cynicism: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) The
