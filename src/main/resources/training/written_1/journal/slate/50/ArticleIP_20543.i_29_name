            As I understand it, when
political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologists</ENAMEX> refer to a society as "civil" they are
citing the many important functions that are performed by voluntary,
intermediate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> are intermediate between the
state and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>. They are voluntary in that the performance of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> within these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> is not dictated by the state or by the
exigencies of the market. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Churches</ENAMEX>, trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>, philanthropic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clubs</ENAMEX> are examples of such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>.

            Each of these
intermediate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> is a society in itself, and each of us spends much of
his life in them. Some of these little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> are civil and some are not. I
use the word "civil" here to mean that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> are cooperative and
respectful of the others and their interests. That is different from "polite,"
which is a surface quality. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of a congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> who calls
upon "the gentle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkasota</ENAMEX>," while thinking, "you dumb hillbilly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bitch</ENAMEX>," is polite but not civil in my sense.

            What makes some of these minisocieties civil and some not?
I think of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> in my experience that were especially civil. One was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced Study of the Behavioral Sciences</ENAMEX>, where I spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> as a fellow
more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years ago</TIMEX>. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30</NUMEX> of us <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellows</ENAMEX> at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX>, political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologists</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX>. Most of us knew few--if any--of the others before we met there,
but we immediately became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and enjoyed a pleasant social life together.
More important, we could consult each other and collect candid advice. There
was no feeling of rivalry among us.

            Being happy just to be at
the center had something to do with the pervasive good feelings. Also, each of
us had shed both his ego requirements and drive for status--at least for the
duration of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>'s leave. The fellowship was not part of one's real life,
it was an interlude to be enjoyed and not spoiled by conflict. It was as if we
were on a cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> we had never seen before and would
probably not see again after the cruise was over.

            My second example is the book discussion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I belong to
at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cosmos Club</ENAMEX> (a venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>, which now admits
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> as well). Book discussion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are regularly described as scenes of
rivalry and hostility--of fights over which books to read and who gets to talk
the most. Why is our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> civil? I credit, in part, the physical and
psychological environment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>, which makes for dignified clubbiness.
But what's more important is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. We are all
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>. We are mostly pretty old. And we
have mostly had, and may still be having, some achievement and attention
outside the book discussion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. So nobody feels the need to assert his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individuality</ENAMEX> and importance. We can relax and enjoy the pleasure of civil
behavior to each other.

            These may seem trivial
cases, in which neither the gain from cooperative effort nor the possible gain
from individual assertion is very large. The key is not in the absolute
strength of these gains but in their relative strength. In the cases I have
mentioned, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> are weak, but the need for ego-satisfaction in this
arena is weaker than the gain from cooperation.

            I can give a more serious example. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>, starting
with the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, I worked for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX>
formulating policy statements on issues of economic policy. We were
all--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>--impressed with the failures of policy that caused
the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Depression</ENAMEX> and that may have contributed to the outbreak of war. We thought
we had some insights that would help to avert such failures in the future. At
the same time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> was a major scene in which we might struggle
for self-expression and status. It was where we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> spent most of our
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">waking hours</TIMEX>, derived our incomes, and achieved status internally and to the
rest of the world. But the divisiveness of these interests was outweighed by
our common interest in the program on which we had embarked. So we all worked
together eagerly and happily to try to bring about a change of policy. We were
a civil society.

            But after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 10 years</TIMEX>,
the memories of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Depression</ENAMEX> and war were fading, some of what we thought were
new ideas had become conventional wisdom, and many of the most inspiring
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had gone on to other things or had retired. Then we
gradually sank into bureaucratic rivalry and sparring--into incivility.

            Different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in a society will have different
views of how civil it is. I thought that those of us who worked on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">economics</ENAMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> made up a civil society. We had a
common goal--the success of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> in economics--and felt besieged
by a common enemy, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. I did not covet anyone else's job and did not
feel that anyone coveted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>. I had no ambitions for more status and attention
within that society. But then I read in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Haldeman</ENAMEX>'s diary, which was
published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Connally</ENAMEX> had
complained to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haldeman</ENAMEX> that several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>--including me--were conspiring
against him. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evidently</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connally</ENAMEX> did not regard that society as civil. For him
it was a jungle out there, even though one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predators</ENAMEX> was really a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rabbit</ENAMEX>.

            Civil behavior has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> side is treating
other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with civility. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> side is interpreting the attitude and
behavior of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> toward oneself as civil. For most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> I suppose the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> side is difficult without the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
Connally was not civil in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> sense. That led him to the not-very-civil
act of complaining to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Haldeman</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Civility</ENAMEX> is not one of the major virtues. It is not
like courage or honesty. The friendly cooperation that characterizes civil
societies is a pale shadow of the love that inspires great self-sacrifice. But
to participate in societies that one perceives to be civil adds much to the
pleasure of life.
