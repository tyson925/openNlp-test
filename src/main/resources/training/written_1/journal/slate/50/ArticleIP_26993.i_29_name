               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s
Wrap-Up
            

            Why Even <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bother To Read the Paper II</ENAMEX>: If you've
ever attended an event that was covered in the press--a ball game, a
demonstration, a series of seemingly motiveless break-ins at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Cruise</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX>--you know how little the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> version resembles your experience. Oh,
it often gets the least important things right, the facts, the small <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"t</ENAMEX>" truth.
But the tone, the texture, the feel of the event is never correct, and that's
where you find the capital "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">T</ENAMEX>" truth. Here's how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> put a similar
problem, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 18, 1775</TIMEX>: "We must consider how very little history there is;
I mean real authentick history. That certain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kings</ENAMEX> reigned, and certain battles
were fought, we can depend upon as true; but all the colouring, all the
philosophy, of history is conjecture."

            To more vividly convey that coloring, many
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> encourage their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> to wield the tools of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX>,
opening a story with an evocative detail, such as these leads, both from the
front of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> : "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ana Estela Lopeze</ENAMEX> dreamed of saving
enough money to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Salvador</ENAMEX> to open a clothing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and build a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-bedroom <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>"; and "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rani</ENAMEX>, an illiterate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">washermen</ENAMEX>'s
caste, changed into her prettiest sari <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one recent morning</TIMEX>."

            When this technique
works, you get a powerful story, albeit one whose subject is not revealed until
around the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> paragraph. When it doesn't, you get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Bragg</ENAMEX> and a queasy
feeling in your stomach. And when both news and coloring are avoided, you get
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuwait Times</ENAMEX> and a nice <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> nap.

            
               Unburdened
Answer
            

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">KUWAIT</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts</ENAMEX> have advised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to stick to
their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> timetable and carry only those books needed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> besides
taking extra care to sit straight while studying. This advice is significant
taking into consideration the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> are faced with a
pressing problem--backaches. The culprit here is the school bag which every
student carries to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> crammed with books and they end up with various
back-related problems, such as backaches or backbone injuries. Addressing a
issue of such importance concerning the younger ones of society, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX>
Times met with a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> and sought their opinion."

            My favorite expert
opinion comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dina Al-Refai</ENAMEX>, family medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX>: "All these aches
may instill in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> a hatred towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and finally have a
negative impact on his academic performance, she remarked."

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuwaiti Fun Facts Extra</ENAMEX>
            

            From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department's Annual Human Rights Report</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 26, 1999</TIMEX>:

            

               Amirs, or princes, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al-Sabah</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> have ruled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> in
consultation with prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> figures for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 200 years</TIMEX>.

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX>, adopted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1962</TIMEX> shortly after independence, provides for
an elected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Assembly.</ENAMEX> It also permits the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amir</ENAMEX> to suspend its articles
during periods of martial law.

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amir</ENAMEX> twice suspended constitutional provisions, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976 to 1981</TIMEX> and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1986 to 1992</TIMEX>, and ruled extraconstitutionally during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these</TIMEX> periods.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Citizens</ENAMEX> cannot change their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> bans formal political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> do not have the
right to vote or seek election to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Assembly.</ENAMEX>

               According to government statistics, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92 percent</NUMEX> of the indigenous work force
is employed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Foreigners</ENAMEX> constitute <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98 percent</NUMEX> of the private
sector work force.

               Domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX> are not protected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Law</ENAMEX>, and unskilled foreign
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> suffer from the lack of a minimum wage in the private sector and from
failure to enforce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Law</ENAMEX>.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Males</ENAMEX> must obtain government approval to marry foreign-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> restricts freedom of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>.

               Public gatherings must receive prior government
approval, as must private gatherings of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> that result in
the issuance of a public statement.
