                  Kicking off a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7 million</NUMEX> ad campaign, gospel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evangelists</ENAMEX> poured out of a giant copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Book</ENAMEX> , an updated,
"cool" version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>. But, says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Book</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>,

Wrap-Up
            

            My favorite detail is
the TV commercial where they pour out of the giant <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>. That's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7 million</NUMEX>
worth of cool right there. From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulliver's Travels</ENAMEX> to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scout troop</ENAMEX>'s
walk through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heart Room</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franklin Institute</ENAMEX>, grotesque
shifts in scale have always been funny, particularly when a little thing is
made big enough to walk into. Amusing roadside Americana is basically a bad
restaurant in the shape of a big <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX>. (With an added dash of cruelty--you
sit in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> and eat a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX>. Kind of rubbing it in.) The converse,
however, is not true: A big thing made tiny is not comic; it's cute, a
dollhouse, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">teddy bear</ENAMEX>, a bonny <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wee Boris Yeltsin</ENAMEX> no bigger than your
thumb--he can ride to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duma</ENAMEX> on the back of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, if he's not too drunk.
The distinction blurs a bit in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fantastic Voyage</ENAMEX> , the movie where Raquel
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch</ENAMEX> was part of a medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> shrunk to microscopic size and injected into
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> with a brain tumor. It's more scary than funny, especially
to the brain tumor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> when he finds out that his chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX> is Raquel
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Knox</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tynedale House</ENAMEX>, says,
"The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Book</ENAMEX> looks friendlier than your typical leather <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>. It's got a
cool title, contemporary package design and clear-reading, single-column
type."

            The leather <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>--isn't
that by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Sade</ENAMEX>?

            Official Summary:

            
               This heart
warming true story will reach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> powerful messages: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, save sex
for marriage; secondly, if you have made the mistake of engaging in pre-marital
sex, you can change your ways. The film features <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corey Edelman</ENAMEX>, lead guitarist
for the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIV</ENAMEX>, and his fianc√© <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vorey Secor</ENAMEX>, a full time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corey</ENAMEX>'s goal was to remain a virgin and save sex for marriage. In fact, he
graduated from high school never kissing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> or drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>. But a
snowboarding accident that nearly killed his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mentor</ENAMEX> sent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corey</ENAMEX> into
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rebelliousness</ENAMEX>. At a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> where he got drunk, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corey</ENAMEX> lost his gift of virginity
to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> he didn't even know. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vorey</ENAMEX> had a different past. She became sexually
active at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>, and engaged in a heart breaking cycle of sexual activity. Both,
who hated what they did, resolved to change their ways by embracing SECONDARY
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">VIRGINITY</ENAMEX> ... the practice where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> stop engaging in pre-marital sex, and
wait until marriage. One teen remarked, "I never understood Secondary Virginity
until I saw this film. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corey</ENAMEX>'s really cool, and I related to him."
