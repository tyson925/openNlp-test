            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s redesign brings with it a new Web site and a slick,
decidedly un-wonkish new look. ... The "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">TRB"</ENAMEX> column argues that the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> should use its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cold War-era</ENAMEX> spying apparatus to monitor human rights abuses. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Spooks</ENAMEX> have
generally shied away from such missions because of the moral and political
dilemmas created when an intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> atrocities. ... A
piece describes wartime propaganda on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> TV. The
programming includes nationalistic music videos, scornful expos√©s of Western
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> is gay, as is most of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabinet</ENAMEX>), and
repeated showings of the film <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wag the Dog</ENAMEX> .

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> endorses the deployment of ground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>.
But a separate editorial says that partial defeat (concessions to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serbs</ENAMEX>, failure to repatriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kosovars</ENAMEX>) will be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>'s "price of going to war

refugee crisis, and the subsequent dispersal of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeless</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kosovars</ENAMEX> across the
already shaky <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkan region</ENAMEX> could cause "a potential collapse of terrifying
proportions." ... A piece bemoans <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s inert tourism <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX>.
Government and industry are squabbling over whether to promote the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> as

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> policy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's caustic cover story ("<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War</ENAMEX>, we are shocked to discover, is not a video

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> 
               lambastes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> for "diplomatic errors and missed

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX> a face-saving compromise; when action became

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">airstrikes</ENAMEX> began, they urged planning for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugee</ENAMEX> crisis sure to come. At
every turn, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> failed to heed. A sidebar reports that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early '90s</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> nixed a plot

               piece crudely indicts the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> (they "didn't
need to load <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kosovars</ENAMEX> into boxcars to look bad"). Since losing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1389</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> have been "seasoned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haters</ENAMEX> raised on self-pity." Both
