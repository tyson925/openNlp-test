difference, I'm not sure whether you're going to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> or wind up in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">penitentiary</ENAMEX>." What difference?

Wrap-Up
            

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox TV</ENAMEX> announced the creation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s cable channels: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boyz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Girlz</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rich Cronin</ENAMEX>
called this separate-but-equal programming an effort to "superserve" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>,
adding, "We will not stereotype in any way."

            Which is more than the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz</ENAMEX> can promise about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX>. To judge from your answers, the entire outfit
is nothing more than a dumping ground for lurid videos of anorexic lawyers
attacking pretentious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> of paranormal cartoons, presided over by an
immoral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tycoon</ENAMEX>. Which only proves that sometimes the easiest jokes really are
the most satisfying.

Answer
            

            To celebrate the final episode of Melrose
Place , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> plans to fill <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of plastic vials with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX> swimming pool, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Delfin</ENAMEX> presumably did not know when he
submitted what he thought was a joke (click ). The vials will be used as prizes
in radio station giveaways and other contests, according to TV
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide</ENAMEX> .

            Yeah, I know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX> never
takes his ideas from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TV Guide</ENAMEX> . Nor does he often stoop to the crassness
inherent in the combination of "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox TV</ENAMEX>" and "plastic vials." The truth is this
question could have been yet more vulgar. I refrained from including TV
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide</ENAMEX> 's report that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was initially stored in "giant jugs."
Godspeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heather Locklear</ENAMEX>.

            The bad rap on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorker</ENAMEX> cartoons is that they are inscrutable. The more depressing truth is
that they are often simply mundane. Try to identify which of the following
captions are from urbane <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> cartoons and which are from a
syndicated strip you wouldn't be caught dead reading, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Lockhorns</ENAMEX> .
