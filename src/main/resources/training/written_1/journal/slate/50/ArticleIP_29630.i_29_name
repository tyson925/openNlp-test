which means role models, and they are lay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> taking on responsibilities

Wrap-Up
            

            Few things are more amusing than the national games
of other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. Even the box scores are funny, so comical are the names of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX>. (Although <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> car <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">soccer</ENAMEX> is brilliant: Small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars ram</ENAMEX> a
huge ball into a goal. It looks ultra-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>, like demolition derby with a
higher purpose.) But for sheer tedium, nothing can rival our own national
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pastime</ENAMEX>. When you are in the field, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50 percent</NUMEX> of that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the
inning is spent doing nothing: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX> is simply holding the ball. And when
your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> is hitting, you spend nearly all that time sitting in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dugout</ENAMEX>.
Thus, for any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 percent</NUMEX> of the game is spent doing nothing at all.

            Of course, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12-minute</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarters</TIMEX> of a
professional <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> game take <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two and a half hours</TIMEX> to televise, but at
least in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBA</ENAMEX> they have the decency to call that downtime what it is: a TV
commercial.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Baseball</ENAMEX> is also,
incidentally, the only sport where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> can smoke during the game; you used
to catch appealing glimpses on television of some professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athlete</ENAMEX> puffing
away. It made a welcome change from the spitting. I think a lot more people
would watch figure skating if they let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> smoke. And diving. And
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sumo</ENAMEX>.

Answer
            

            For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 300-year</TIMEX> history of sumo,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigner</ENAMEX> became grand <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX> by defeating another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigner</ENAMEX>.

            Both are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polynesian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samoan</ENAMEX> ancestry. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akebono</ENAMEX> became the first
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">non-Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">yokozuna</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Wrestlers</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX>, and
Mongolia are also currently active. A few foreign
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rikishi</ENAMEX> --<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wrestlers</ENAMEX>--have become popular, but some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> charge that
they prevail through sheer size rather than agility. Musashimaru weighs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">473</NUMEX>
pounds.
