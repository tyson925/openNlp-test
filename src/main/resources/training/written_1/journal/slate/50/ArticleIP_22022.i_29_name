Wrap-Up
               

            

            In a tight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz</ENAMEX> race
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Living National Symbol of Old Age</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> just edged out <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strom</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurmond</ENAMEX>. But the fact is neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> can live forever. Can he? No, no, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">no. Of</ENAMEX>
course not. So it's not too soon to think about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>'s persona
was genial but addlepated old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurmond</ENAMEX>'s was mean-spirited but
concupiscent old racist. Who will be our next cartoon old-timer, and what
particular geriatric qualities will he or she embody? <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Charlton</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heston</ENAMEX>--coldhearted but handsome old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bully</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leni Riefenstahl</ENAMEX>--satanic yet
visually gifted old narcissist? Nominations welcome.

            
               Inventive
Answer
            

            Each was invented by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1790 and 1984</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1.5 percent</NUMEX> of those
receiving patents were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sabra Chartrand</ENAMEX> in the New York
Times . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1984 to 1996</TIMEX>, that increased to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.2 percent</NUMEX>. When they were
more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>-bound, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> inventors devised solutions to domestic problems.
This is no longer the case. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.7 percent</NUMEX> of the scientific and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">engineering</ENAMEX> patents went to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, many of whom won not as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">independents</ENAMEX>, but as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>.
