               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Prudie</ENAMEX>,
            

            
               Here's the scoop.
Our female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> (she's in her <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">40s</NUMEX> like the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gals</ENAMEX> who work for her)
is installing a new, rather large hot tub at her and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s secluded
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> of us have been invited to a picnic/hot tub grand opening <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>,
to use her words. She said, "Of course, nobody will be wearing suits, so don't
bother bringing them." We feel pressured to attend and partake in the nude
socializing in and outside the tub. Some of us are completely comfortable,
others are less sure. Your thoughts?
            

            
-- Wondering
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Won</ENAMEX>,

            Do not naked into that hot tub go. Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> must
have oatmeal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX> for brains as well as a complete lack of judgment.

            It sounds to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> as though you are not the only
one feeling uncomfortable with the birthday-suit event. Luckily, you have
options.You and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> can all agree to bring suits--and so
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">inform Nature Girl</ENAMEX>. If you're not all in agreement, which may be the case
because you say, "Some of us are completely comfortable," then you can decline
... either with an explanation or without <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. If you totally <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> out about
stating your reservations, there is always the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> flu.

            Prudie assures you there
is no need to feel "pressured." There can be no retaliation for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> who
choose not to socialize in the altogether with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aunt</ENAMEX> used to say, "The very idea."

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, resolutely

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Prudie</ENAMEX>,
            

            
               My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> is perfect, but ... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ah</ENAMEX>, it's
always the big but. What's my big but? Fun, smart, beautiful, but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX>
just won't give me any space. If we don't spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">seven evenings</NUMEX> a week together,
if we don't talk on the phone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> during work, if I want to spend any time
alone, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> pouts and gets angry, or cries.
            

            
               We have talked about this over and over again
(and almost broke up over it several times), and she is getting better, but ...
I put my foot down and insisted that there are just times I need to be by
myself, and while she accepts that in principle, I often feel on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX>, as
she often gets extremely upset with little provocation if I don't give her
enough attention.
            

            
               Can this hostile
dependency be cured? Can I, should I, even, expect her to change? I hate the
idea that I love her "except for this one thing I want to change," but really,
she is absolutely wonderful. Except that too much of a good thing is still too
much.
            

            

               --
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sated</ENAMEX> and Then Stuffed
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Sate</ENAMEX>,

            It is interesting that you write Prudie that your
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inamorata</ENAMEX> is demanding and wants to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every minute</TIMEX> together--which is not
what you want--but that she is "absolutely wonderful." This is like saying the
souffl√© is the most delicious one ever, save for the ground glass mixed in.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lovers</ENAMEX> are not reform
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and you will not get your "perfect ... but" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> to change this
aspect of her personality. This leaves you two choices. You can accept her
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">possessiveness</ENAMEX> and kiss time to yourself goodby, or ring off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> and preserve
some autonomy. If you choose the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> option, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> predicts your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hostility</ENAMEX> will build until you wind up choosing the latter. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s
demands suggest an underlying jealousy and immaturity that time will most
likely aggravate. It's your call.

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, honestly

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Prudie</ENAMEX>,
            

            
               I have a very close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> (we were in junior
high together in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>) who seems to have just dropped out of society. He
doesn't look for work, having been let go from his last job. He rarely washes,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">smokes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> too much (amongst other similar vices), and spends the time
he's not watching infomercials until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 a.m.</TIMEX>, pining over a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> who broke up
with him long ago. He's living off unemployment, and that's going to run out
soon. 
               Oh, did I mention? He's living on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couch</ENAMEX>.
            

            
               To his credit, he's not hard to live with. He
cleans up after himself, gives me my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>, and doesn't eat too much of my
food, and when he does he eventually replaces it. Plus, he's great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.
We've got very similar sense of humor and we have great conversations.
            

            
               I guess what kills
me is that he's a talented, smart, able <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> and he's just tossing it away
without a care. He doesn't hit me up for money, but I'm a little worried with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> funds <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ending in a month</TIMEX>. I've tried hints from subtle to overt
that I don't really approve of what he's doing, but I don't want to kick him
out. Any advice?
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friend</ENAMEX> in Need
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Fren</ENAMEX>,

            And you are a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, indeed. You are also clearly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conflicted</ENAMEX>. Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX> is an unemployed, unmotivated, slovenly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vidiot</ENAMEX> who
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">smokes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> while being fixated on a long gone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX>. He is also
depressed. You find him, however, a good-humored <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chap</ENAMEX> who's a great
conversationalist, as well as someone who replenishes the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">groceries</ENAMEX>.When you
say he is "tossing it away without a care," you are telling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> you would
give anything to redo this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>'s thinking. But alas, you can't. We each get a
life to make of it what we will ... and this is what he's doing with his.

            You say you don't want
to kick him out and also mention that his unemployment benefits are soon to
end. Be prepared for this sad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> to become your ward if you don't insist he
get some mental health help and leave your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nest</ENAMEX> to make a life.

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, realistically

            
               Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
            

            
               I'm an 18-year-old
student majoring in psychology. I like psych but don't love it. What I really
want to be is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX>, but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are against it. I know I'll never be as
happy as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> as I would be as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX>. I have the talent but not
the moral support. I have been tempted many times to run away from home because
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are unsupportive of my ambition. I'm embarrassed because I can't
stand up for myself.
            

            

               --Carpe Diem
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Carp</ENAMEX>,

            Prudie, too, is for seizing the diem, so give your
dream a try and go for it. You are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 18</NUMEX>, after all, which gives you a few
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> to play with.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> is taking you at your word that you have
talent -- though sometimes even that isn't enough to achieve your goal. But
forget your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opposition</ENAMEX> and trust your instinct. Whether you make it or
not as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX>, you will not have to look back and regret that you never
tried. And P.S.: It is not considered "running away from home" when one is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>.
That is the age, after all, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> go to college or into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>.

            If good fortune strikes,
send <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> a CD.

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, melodically

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Prudie</ENAMEX>,
            

            
               I think I hate my
job. I must hate my job because I dread getting up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every weekday</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>. I have used all my personal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and my sick <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, which is making me
feel trapped and frantic. What should I do?
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freaked</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Freak</ENAMEX>,

            You've used up all your
sick <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>? Well, you could always call in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dead</ENAMEX>. Then you should quit. Prudie
can imagine nothing more sad-making than to loathe one's job. Use an employment
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>, the want ads, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, anything, but find a more satisfying way to keep
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and soul together.
