            A piece argues that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX> serves as both whipping boy and ghost for the dispirited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
Party. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX> is blamed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>'s sinking popularity, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> still
practice his brand of antagonistic, moralistic politicking. ... New

reminiscent of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Freudian</ENAMEX> notions of the unconscious. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Irrational anxiety</ENAMEX>,

facing charges of pedophilia and sexual abuse.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first lady</ENAMEX> is flirting with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> run, and
the newsweeklies flirt right back with cover stories and ample advice.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> 's ebullient cover story calls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> "the hottest commodity in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> public life," urging her to run because: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) She has sacrificed enough

will eat her alive, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>'s a grind ("you won't fly on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX> or
ride in escorted motorcades"), and she'd eventually make an even better
presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's cover story is more restrained: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudy Giuliani</ENAMEX>
("makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Starr</ENAMEX> look like a patsy") would rip her to shreds, and it's not

sliding, and the cost of supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> could cause a global recession.

            The cover story asserts
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Quayle</ENAMEX> is a seasoned, ideologically consistent, genuinely religious
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> who could restitch the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> of economic and social
