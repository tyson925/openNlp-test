            Their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> was a hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.

            Each <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX> rabbit sprung open

            above the bathroom sink, drip slowed

            by the split pink pods of its ears

            to an intravenous trickle.

            There was the occasional <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>,

            though he had no particular taste

            for venison--too stringy, he said,

            but made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> smoke it up just in case,

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> haunches and the
ribs.

            Summer always ended with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">catfish</ENAMEX>

            large as a grown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s thigh

            severed at the hip, thrashing

            in a tin washtub: a mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, a fish

            who knew the world was to be endured

            between mud and the
shining hook.

            He avoided easy quarry: possum

            and squirrel, complacent carp.

            He wouldn't be caught dead

            bagging coon; coon, he said,

            was fickle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>--tasted like

            chicken <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX>, the next like

            poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lobster</ENAMEX>. He'd never admit

            being reduced to eating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coon</ENAMEX>,

            to be called out of his name

            and into that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cartoon</ENAMEX>.

            It's not surprising they could eat the mess

            he made of their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX>: They watched

            the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> hog gutted with grim fury,

            a kind of love gone wrong, but oh

            they adored each whiskery hock, each

            ham slice brushed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subterranean</ENAMEX> green.

            They were eating his misery

            like bad <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> meant to help them

            grow. They would have done anything

            not to see his hand jerk like that,

            his belt hissing through the loops and

            around that fist working inside the coils

            like an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal gnawing</ENAMEX>, an animal

            who knows freedom's worth anything

            you need to leave behind to get to it--

            even your own flesh and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>.
