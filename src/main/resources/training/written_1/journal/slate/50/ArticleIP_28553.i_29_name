            Those poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souls</ENAMEX> who've been camping out in front
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX>: Who can blame them for saying, "To hell with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>, we know it will be great!"? The doors will open, and they'll race to
grab the best seats and feel a surge of triumph as their butts sink down. We've
made it: Yeeehaww!! They'll cheer when the familiar <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Williams</ENAMEX>
fanfare erupts and the title-- <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom</ENAMEX>
Menace --rises out of the screen and the backward-slanted opening "crawl"
begins: "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ..." Yaaahhhhhhh!!!
Then, their hearts pounding, they'll settle back to read the rest of the
titles: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turmoil</ENAMEX> has engulfed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Galactic Republic</ENAMEX>. The taxation of trade
routes to outlying star systems is in dispute." Taxation of trade routes:
Waaahoooo!!!!
            

            How long will they go with it? At what point will
they realize that what they've heard is, alas, true, that the picture really is
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stiff</ENAMEX>? Maybe they never will. Maybe they'll want to love The

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phantom Menace</ENAMEX> so much--because they have so much emotional energy
invested in loving it, and in buying the books, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>, dolls, cards,
clothes, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soap</ENAMEX>, fast food, etc.--that the realization will never sink in. In
successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypnosis</ENAMEX>, the subject works to enter a state of heightened
susceptibility, to surrender to a higher power. Maybe they'll conclude that
common sense is the enemy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force</ENAMEX> and fight it to the death.

            Look, I wanted to love
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Phantom Menace</ENAMEX> , too. I was an adolescent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> and would enjoy being
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> again for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a couple of hours</TIMEX>. But the movie has a way of deflating all but
the most delusional of hopes. If someone had given <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Wood</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$115 million</NUMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">remake Plan Nine From Outer Space</ENAMEX> it might have looked like this,
although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wood</ENAMEX>'s dialogue would surely have been more memorable.

            The first thing that will strike you is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Lucas</ENAMEX>,
who wrote and directed the movie, has forgotten how to write and direct a
movie. Having spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the two decades</TIMEX> since the original Star Wars (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>)
concocting skeletons of screenplays that other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> flesh out, and overseeing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">productions</ENAMEX> that other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people storyboard</ENAMEX> and stage, he has come to lack what
one might Michelangelistically term "the spark of life." If the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX>
Wars was a box of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cracker Jacks</ENAMEX> that was all prizes, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Phantom</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menace</ENAMEX> is a box of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cracker Jacks</ENAMEX> that's all diagrams of prizes. It's there
on paper, but it's waiting to be filled in and jazzed up.

            Advance word has been
cruel to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX>, but advance word has it only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> right. Yes, they're
terrible, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liam Neeson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ewan McGregor</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Natalie Portman</ENAMEX> are not terrible
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX>, they've just been given scenes that no human could be expected to play.
As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sage Jedi Master</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Qui-Gon Jinn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neeson</ENAMEX> must maintain a Zen-like
detachment from the universe around him--probably not a challenge when that
universe will be added in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> by computers. "I don't sense anything," he
tells his uneasy young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apprentice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Obi-Wan Kenobi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGregor</ENAMEX>), as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sit
waiting to conduct trade negotiations with a bunch of gray, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>-faced
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> who talk like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extras</ENAMEX> in a samurai movie. McGregor furrows
his brow. "There's something ... elusive," he says, working to enunciate like a
young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alec Guinness</ENAMEX> but succeeding only in nullifying his natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Scots</ENAMEX> charm.
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Master</ENAMEX>," he adds, "you said I should be mindful of the future." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neeson</ENAMEX> thinks
a bit. "I do sense an unusual amount of fear for something as trivial as this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX> dispute."

            A hologram of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darth Sidious</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dark Lord</ENAMEX> of the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sith</ENAMEX>,"
commands the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federation</ENAMEX> to sic its battle droids on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Jedi ambassadors</ENAMEX> before
they can apprise <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Amidala</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portman</ENAMEX>) of the imminent invasion of the
peaceful planet of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naboo</ENAMEX>. In come the battle droids and out come the light
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sabers</ENAMEX>, which still hum like faulty fluorescents. Clack, clack, clack. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucas</ENAMEX>
can't edit fight scenes so that they're fluid--he cuts on the clack. You get
the gist, though. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Jedi</ENAMEX> make their getaway, but with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and tolls and droid
destroyers, it takes them over an hour to land on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naboo</ENAMEX>, by which time the
queen and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galactic Senate</ENAMEX> have already got the grim message. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX> have been disrupted: "A communications disruption can mean only
one thing," says someone. "Invasion."

            Queen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amidala</ENAMEX>, done up
like a white-faced <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">empress</ENAMEX> in hanging beads and glass balls and a hat
with curly horns, speaks in tones from which emotion has been expunged, perhaps
on the theory that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> won't argue with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> who puts them to sleep: "I
... will ... not ... condone ... a ... course ... of ... action ... that ...
will ... lead ... us ... to ... war," she drones. Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Jedi whiz</ENAMEX>
through the underwater core of a planet in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>-of-warlike submersible pursued
by 3-D <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dragony beasties</ENAMEX> and a giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">catfish</ENAMEX> with extra movable parts.
Potentially thrilling stuff, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neeson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGregor</ENAMEX> remain peculiarly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unruffled</ENAMEX>. "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force</ENAMEX> will guide us," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neeson</ENAMEX> blandly, and the director
seems to share his lack of urgency. There's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zen</ENAMEX> detachment and there's Quaalude
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detachment</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Phantom</ENAMEX> 
               Menace falls into the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>: It
really does take place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time ago</TIMEX>, in a galaxy far, far away. When R2-D2
showed up, I thought: At last, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> with the potential for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intimacy</ENAMEX>!
            

            Say this for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucas</ENAMEX>, he doesn't whip up a lot of bogus
energy, the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> of such blockbusters as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Mummy</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>) and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armageddon</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>) do. It's as if he conceived <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Phantom Menace</ENAMEX>
as a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> No pageant and has purposely deadened his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX>, directing them
to stand stiffly in the dead center of the screen against matte paintings of
space or some futuristic metropolis and deliver lines alternately formal or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bemusing</ENAMEX>. ("This is an odd move for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade Federation</ENAMEX>.") <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucas</ENAMEX> considers
himself an "independent" filmmaker and an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> of integrity. Had he not been
such a pretentious overlord, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">platoon</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">screenwriters</ENAMEX> would doubtless have
been engaged to rewrite him and make the movie halfway human. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddy</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> would have punched up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Qui-Gon Jinn/Obi-Wan Kenobi</ENAMEX> badinage, and
a black dialogue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> would have given the comic-relief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jar</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jar Binks</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>-size <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaur</ENAMEX> with pop eyes and a vaguely <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">West Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">patois</ENAMEX>,
something fresher than "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ex-squeeze me</ENAMEX>!" and a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Butterfly McQueen</ENAMEX>-style
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">simpering</ENAMEX> and running away from battles. Those of us who complain about the
assembly-line production of "blockbuster" scripts need an occasional reminder
that assembly lines can do much to make empty thrill machines more lively.

            
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phantom</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menace</ENAMEX> didn't need to be barren of feeling, but it took a real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Kasdan</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Big Chill</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>), to draft the best and most
inspiring of the Star Wars movies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Empire Strikes Back</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>), and a real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irvin Kershner</ENAMEX>, to breathe Wagnerian grandeur into
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucas</ENAMEX>' cartoonish fantasies. Having lived with the saga for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">so many years</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> was prepared to set aside some of its narrative expectations here to
plumb the origins of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucas</ENAMEX>' universe. In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Phantom Menace</ENAMEX> , however,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Jedi</ENAMEX> already exist and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force</ENAMEX> is taken for granted--we're still
in the middle of the damn story. The only dramatic interest comes from a young
Tatooine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anakin Skywalker</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jake Lloyd</ENAMEX>), whom we know will grow up
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luke Skywalker</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Hamill</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carrie Fisher</ENAMEX>) and
then surrender to the dark side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force</ENAMEX> and become <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darth Vader</ENAMEX>. But that
transformation won't happen until the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> episode; meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anakin</ENAMEX> is a
conventionally industrious juvenile with a penchant for building droids from
scratch and "pod racing"--an activity that he demonstrates in one of the
movie's most impressive but irrelevant special effects set pieces, a whiplash
hyperdrive permutation of the chariot race in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben-Hur</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX>).

            Later in the film, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anakin</ENAMEX> goes before something called
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jedi Council</ENAMEX> and meets <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel L. Jackson</ENAMEX> (together again!), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucas</ENAMEX>
dramatizes the interrogation so ineptly that you either have to take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yoda</ENAMEX>'s
word that there's something wrong with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> ("Clouded this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>'s future is")
or to conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoda</ENAMEX>, like us, is moving backward through time and has
already seen Episodes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. Anakin, he says smugly, has fear in him, and
fear leads to anger and anger to the dark side--which would mean, as I
interpret it, that only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> without fear (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who don't exist) are
suitable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Jedi knighthood</ENAMEX> (perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoda</ENAMEX> will enlarge his
definition of fear in subsequent episodes). There's also some quasireligious,
quasiscientific blather to the effect that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> was conceived without a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> by "metachorians"--symbiont, microscopic life forms that will speak to
you if you "quiet your mind." In other words, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force</ENAMEX>. So, it's not nebulous,
after all! It can be measured. It can be quantified. It can even, perhaps, be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">merchandised</ENAMEX>.

            Yes, the effects are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">first-rate</ENAMEX>, occasionally breathtaking. But the floating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galactic Senate</ENAMEX> do little to distract you from parliamentary machinations that
play like an especially dull day on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</ENAMEX> . The
final military engagement, in which long-headed attack droids are rolled onto
the field as the spokes of a giant wheel, would be awesome if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucas</ENAMEX> didn't
routinely cut away from the battle just when he seems on the verge of actually
thrilling you. The chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villain</ENAMEX>, bombastically named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darth Maul</ENAMEX>, is a horned,
red, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kabuki</ENAMEX>-style snake demon with orange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pingpong</ENAMEX>-ball eyes who challenges the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Jedi</ENAMEX> to a couple of clackety light-saber battles. His appearances are
underscored by demonic chants; he might as well wear a neon beanie that flashes
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bad Guy</ENAMEX>." Like all revisionist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucas</ENAMEX> cheats like mad. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darth</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vader</ENAMEX> had built <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-3PO</ENAMEX> as a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, how come he never paid much attention to
him in the other movies--and vice versa? As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoda</ENAMEX> himself puts it, in another
context, "See through you we can."

            
Still, it's worth reprinting a blistering
e-mail sent to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> by a relative, after she'd let him know that I hated
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Phantom Menace :</ENAMEX>

            
               Surprise, Surprise. Star Wars was
never reviewed well by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>. Sometimes a basic story that rests on great
special effects and stupid dialogue can be very entertaining--it's called a
cult movie, and no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> can have an effect on the obvious outcome that this
is going to be the highest grossing movie ever. I myself stood in line for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> and already have tickets to see it <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times, and I know I'll enjoy it.
Why? Because it plays on my childhood imagination. And I'm sure it's not as bad
as Return of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Jedi</ENAMEX> , which was the weakest one--but I still liked it
and saw it <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> times. I get tired of being told I'm not going to like it
because it doesn't adhere to certain basic critic criteria. I say bpthhhh
(sticking my tongue out to review)--don't be sending me anything dissing my
movie:):):)
            

            I'll be curious to know whether he sees The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phantom Menace</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> times, or even the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> for which he has paid. (I
could imagine seeing it <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times only if they sold adrenaline shots at the
concession stand.) Or maybe he'll come out of the movie and say: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No</ENAMEX>, you
didn't get it, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snot-Nosed-Criteria Critic Person</ENAMEX>. It's not supposed to be
exciting. It's laying the foundation for the next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anakin</ENAMEX> and
Obi-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wan</ENAMEX> defeat the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mandalorian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Clone Wars and Anakin</ENAMEX> marries
Queen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amidala</ENAMEX>. And listen, I'm getting in line even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> for tickets to
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Episode 2</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force</ENAMEX> is with me, butt-head."
