               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s
Wrap-Up
            

            Judging by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>--and I do--the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> likeliest to express nasal disdain are
film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> and political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX>. This is a disturbing ceding of the field
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>. It is, for instance, the right of every <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> to carp
about his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> (I believe that's in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX>) and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> (the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bible</ENAMEX>). But there is a recent reluctance to fire at certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> unless one
has impressive credentials, a professionalizing of contumely. This is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lamentable</ENAMEX> and unnecessary. Remember (using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ginkoba</ENAMEX> if need be) what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>
said about literary criticism: "You may scold a carpenter who has made you a
bad table, though you cannot make a table. It is not your trade to make
tables." Although as any trained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> can tell you, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Cham</ENAMEX>
clearly did not mean you should criticize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz</ENAMEX> because you're discontent
with the replies selected for Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.

            
               Really, Really
Sorry Answer
            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Lyons</ENAMEX> was describing his theft of the
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250,000</NUMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Anti</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defamation League of B'nai B'rith</ENAMEX> had donated to rebuild
black <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> destroyed by fire.

            The weeping minister
spoke in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Largo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fla.</ENAMEX>, as he was sentenced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a half years</TIMEX> in prison
for swindling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $4 million</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Baptist Convention USA</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s largest black denomination, while serving as its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. "I
cannot shake the feeling that I have let so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> down," he added. Well,
yeah.
