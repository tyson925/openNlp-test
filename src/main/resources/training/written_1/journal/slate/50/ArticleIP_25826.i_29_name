            Ask <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> a question
on any subject, and you'll hear <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> opinions (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">election season</TIMEX>) and
probably start a brawl. And even on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>, a topic you wouldn't think <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX>
could disagree about, they are managing to squabble, revealing a peculiar
ambivalence about this black-and-white issue.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American Jews</ENAMEX> have
uniformly greeted the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> brutality in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> with outrage. They identified
with the displaced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kosovars</ENAMEX>, comparing them to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX>. They
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commended NATO</ENAMEX> for bombing quickly rather than ignoring the brutality as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> did during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> ran newspaper ads
depicting trainloads of bedraggled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kosovars</ENAMEX>, an echo of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> concentration camp
trains. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American Jews</ENAMEX> poured cash into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</NUMEX> relief funds established by
national <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> sent relief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli Jews</ENAMEX>' reaction to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> has been equally intense
but much more complicated. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American Jews</ENAMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli Jews</ENAMEX> view <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> as
a reminder of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> and feel a special obligation to aid <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovars</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> has done more for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kosovar</ENAMEX> relief than any other non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> (as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Netanyahu</ENAMEX> never hesitates to note). <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> sent a field
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macedonia</ENAMEX> and welcomed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">112</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kosovar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX>,
offering them permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> also mobbed a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> benefit
concert.

            But beneath <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX>'
sympathy for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kosovars</ENAMEX> lurk more perplexing reactions that illuminate the
anxieties of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> where a beleaguered ethnic minority seeks independence,
the byzantine nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> electoral politics, and the enduring weight of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>--but not the weight you'd expect.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> doubts about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> begin with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> doubts about
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> have compared the ethnic
cleansing of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> "nakba " of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX>, when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX> fled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> and ended up in permanent refugee <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>. (This
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analogy</ENAMEX> has been endorsed by the likes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economist</ENAMEX> , which called
the flight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX> an unpunished ethnic cleansing.) <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX>
also claim that the West's intervention to preserve <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kosovar</ENAMEX> autonomy confirms
their right to independence. "We will ask the international community to
intervene to end the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">land</ENAMEX> and to expel the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> from it," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed Abdel Rahman</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palestinian Authority</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabinet</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX>, citing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> bombing as exemplar.

            Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> are merely
irritated with this <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> claim, viewing it as an unseemly attempt to
exploit the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> crisis and as a faulty analogy. (An <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX> prompted the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> flight, not an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab</ENAMEX>
territory.) But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s far right has taken the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> claim seriously.
The far right views <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> not as tragedy but as threat, "a dangerous
precedent." Some right-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knesset</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have called for an end to the
airstrikes: If the West intervenes on behalf of an independence-seeking ethnic
minority in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>, one asked, "couldn't it happen here, too, in a different
variation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>?"

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> only exacerbate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">righteousness</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> right-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">paranoia</ENAMEX> by calling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo Serbia</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>." If <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>
is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>, that means that either a) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s hold on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unjustified</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX> argue; or b) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX>'s hold on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> is justified,
as a few fringe-right <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> are now hinting.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> ambivalence has
also become a pawn in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> election. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> left has
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blasted Netanyahu</ENAMEX> for his languorous response to the humanitarian crisis: He
took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX> to decide that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> would help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> and several more
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> to announce support for bombing.

            But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>, particularly hawkish Foreign
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ariel Sharon</ENAMEX>, are using <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> more cleverly. Early in the bombing,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharon</ENAMEX> warned that an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> could become the heart of a "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greater</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Albania</ENAMEX>" that would be a staging ground for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> terrorism. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> quickly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disavowed Sharon</ENAMEX>'s remarks, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharon</ENAMEX> had scored points with the far right,
where <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Muslim</ENAMEX> sentiment abounds. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> have been full of
unsubstantiated reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kosovo Liberation Army</ENAMEX> is funded by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osama Bin Laden</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX>. Calls to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s far-right talk
radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> have demanded that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> send its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim Kosovar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharon</ENAMEX> has especially
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">exploited Kosovo</ENAMEX> to court <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 million</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>, whose
votes are expected to decide the election's outcome. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharon</ENAMEX> has visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few months</TIMEX>, including once in the midst of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>
bombing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharon</ENAMEX> eagerly sucked up to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yevgeny Primakov</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">implicitly</ENAMEX> condemning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> bombing during his most recent trip. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> are not especially pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serb</ENAMEX>, but they definitely want close ties with
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>. So, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharon</ENAMEX> is using <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> to butter up <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>. That, in turn, could
swing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>.

            The final and most beguiling aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ambivalence</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remembrance</ENAMEX> but of a different sort. There is
lingering <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> sympathy for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX> rooted in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX>' supposedly admirable
behavior during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX>. The premise: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> welcomed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> into their
anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> guerilla <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) individual <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> bravely sheltered <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nazis</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> fought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nazis</ENAMEX> harder than anyone; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>
were victimized by brutal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Croats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bosnian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>.

            During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX> has taken advantage of this version of its <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> history to make
common cause with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late '80s</TIMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blessing</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>, a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> organized the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian Jewish</ENAMEX> Friendship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX>,
which has propagandized endlessly about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust decency</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX>
also tried to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> over their shared enmity with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serb</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> made themselves sister <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> was shooting missiles
into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel Aviv</ENAMEX> to
show solidarity. There were rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> even supplied <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX> with
arms.

            This mythology of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> goodness paid off during <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Croatia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX> wars. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> sided with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Croats</ENAMEX>, who
had been truly monstrous toward <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> during the war. And even when it became
clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> were slaughtering <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bosnian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> was largely silent,
and even occasionally sympathetic, about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">misbehavior</ENAMEX>.

            As it happens, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX>'s treatment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> was
not as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> have portrayed it. It's true that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tito</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Partisans</ENAMEX>
welcomed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> into their guerilla <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, and it's true that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> were not
as terrible as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Croats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosnians</ENAMEX>. But, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chetniks</ENAMEX>, who are the
direct ancestors of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationalists</ENAMEX>, were consistently and
violently <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Semitic</ENAMEX>. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chetniks</ENAMEX> also supported the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazis</ENAMEX> for much of the
war, and even turned over <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> to them.) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> collaborationist regime
cooperated eagerly with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazis</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> fared much worse than most
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazis</ENAMEX> exterminated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 90 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> at a camp right outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serbs</ENAMEX> did not resist
or protest this slaughter.

            Even so, vestigial sympathy for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> remains today
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> (and, in a much more limited way, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> has
seen a few small pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serb</ENAMEX> demonstrations during the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> crisis, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> frequently refer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX>' decency during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX>. Such
expressions of solidarity, along with right-wing distaste for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> bombing,
don't begin to outweigh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> sympathy for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kosovars</ENAMEX> and outrage at <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX>. But
God knows they're more than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> deserve.
