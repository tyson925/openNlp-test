               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s
Wrap-Up
            

            With the glorious
exception of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crispin</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day</TIMEX> speech from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry V</ENAMEX> , there is nothing
more demoralizing than an inspirational address. That sort of thing generally
entails a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> or an east regional sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> exhorting you to do something
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pointless</ENAMEX>, painful, or profitable to someone else. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physics</ENAMEX> has few
inspirational speeches: Unify that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Field Theory</ENAMEX>! Writing novels, performing
surgery, preparing a light and elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souffl√©</ENAMEX>--each must be done without
rousing declamation. Sex sometimes includes a heartening oration, but usually
toward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, urging you on to mutual victory; such remarks are rarely
delivered at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">halftime</TIMEX>, when you're lurking in the locker <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, glum and
battered. (The exception here is phone sex, where the inspirational speech
pretty much is the sex.) "For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX>"--that's what
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gladiators</ENAMEX> used to say. Not too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> seek inspiration from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, although a surprising number do seek sex there, frequently for money.
But they think themselves <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accurs'd</ENAMEX> and hold their manhoods cheap. Poor
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bastards</ENAMEX>.
