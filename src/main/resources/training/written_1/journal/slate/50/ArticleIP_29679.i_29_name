            Not content, apparently, with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>'s pioneering
status as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to legalize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>-assisted suicide, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>
state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has decided to be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to offer
financially assisted suicide as well. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX> the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> in charge of
determining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> assistance for the poor included assisted suicide among
the approved uses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s health-care dollars.

            So, how much does it cost to kill yourself, anyway?
Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Oregon Death With Dignity Act</ENAMEX> you must consult with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> and a
psychiatric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counselor</ENAMEX> before imbibing the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$45</NUMEX> cup of hemlock (actually
Phenobarbital <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>). It turns out to be quite hard to get a price quote for this
service over the phone. Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX> I talked to said you would probably
need <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least five</NUMEX> professional visits at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$60</NUMEX> each, for a total bill of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$350</NUMEX> or
more. But the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> for whom claims have been made so far cost the
state a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $99</NUMEX>, which suggests that not a lot of handholding was
going on.

            Since death itself costs
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$45</NUMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-for-<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$99</NUMEX> figure suggests that the poor of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> who claim this
benefit are getting only <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.50</NUMEX> worth of dignity. On the other hand, how many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are there in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> who would like to die but have to go on living
because they can't scrape together <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$49.50</NUMEX>?

            But here's the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">killer</ENAMEX>. Before expanding the definition of
"health services" to include intentional death by overdose, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> was known
for another kind of health-policy sang-froid. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years ago</TIMEX> the state
expanded medical benefits to cover more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> but fewer ailments. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Commission</ENAMEX> was set up to consider all illnesses and the treatments
available and to prioritize them on a cost-benefit basis. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX>'s list
identifies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">743</NUMEX> different conditions and treatments. There was only enough money
to treat the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">574</NUMEX> conditions. Venereal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">warts</ENAMEX> just made the cut. Uninsured
sufferers from condition No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">575</NUMEX>--anal fissures--are out of luck. Ditto Nos.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">576</NUMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">743</ENAMEX>.

            After hearings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> decided that, since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> had approved of
physician-assisted suicide in not one but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> referendums, it was appropriate
to include this service under the category of "comfort care" for the terminally
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ill.</ENAMEX> "Comfort care" entered the chart at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">No. 263</NUMEX> with a bullet, just below
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acute ischemic heart disease</ENAMEX> and delirium tremens, nosing ahead of various
mental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Tourette's syndrome</ENAMEX>, and rectal polyps.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX> is reconsidering all this. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People</ENAMEX>
afflicted with illnesses that have not made the funding cut (particularly a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monty Pythonesque</ENAMEX> name of Not <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dead Yet</ENAMEX>) are irate that a
lifesaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">No. 570</ENAMEX> can depend on the annual
appropriating whims of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX>, while a free barbiturate consolation
prize is safely ensconced at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">No. 263</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Defenders</ENAMEX> of the commission counter that
it would be unconscionable to deny poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> a right as fundamental as
death.

            It sounds like classic
big-spending liberalism. But is that what is really at work here? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aiding</ENAMEX> and
abetting a suicide--even at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$350</NUMEX> per--is cheaper than just about any other
serious medical treatment. Anyone dying in a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> will quickly cost
more by staying alive than by exercising the right to die, dignity and all. The
commission declined to estimate the cost impact of fatal "comfort care." It
could easily be positive, a money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saver</ENAMEX>. If I were an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Plan</ENAMEX> member
who suffered from anal fissures (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">No. 575</ENAMEX>), my first reaction would be
bitterness that by putting assisted suicide at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">No. 263</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> had
bumped me and my suffering off the list. But my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> reaction would be that
the more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who take advantage of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">No. 263</NUMEX>, the more likely it is that there
will be money enough for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">No. 575</NUMEX> after all.

            Given the harrumphing by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>
never intended to fund suicide when they approved the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> referendum, the era
of government-subsidized death will probably soon be over. A federal bill
sponsored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orrin Hatch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>, would forbid the prescription of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>
for assisted suicide, presumably taking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> out of the death-assistance
business for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.

            This is too bad. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> led the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in facing
the health-care rationing issue head-on. And now, perhaps unintentionally, it
has taken the next logical step: bribing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to go early and save the system
a bit of money. To the agonizing issue of health-care costs for the terminally
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> has stumbled onto a kind of answer, heartless though it may be.
Those who attack it will have to come up with something better.
