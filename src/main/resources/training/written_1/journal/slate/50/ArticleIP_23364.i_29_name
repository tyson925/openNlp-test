Wrap-Up
            

            It is instinctive to reject a patriotic list of
Official <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Enemies</ENAMEX>. The more these authorized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villains</ENAMEX> are shot at in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stallone-Schwartzenegger-Willis</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibson</ENAMEX> movies, the more one wants to be a drug
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> or terrorist when he grows up. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> does glamorize everything.
(Except maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Fishburne</ENAMEX>--what was he rambling on about in The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matrix</ENAMEX> ? I dozed a bit there.)

            It is harder to rebuff a national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> list when
bombs are falling, particularly when those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> are implicated in appalling
deeds. It might, however, be possible to resist the grossest forms of jingoism.
Consider how badly certain <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> songs have aged--"I'm <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Going To Slap</ENAMEX>
That <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dirty Little Jap</ENAMEX>." And those wartime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX> cartoons where Bugs
Bunny battles grotesque caricatures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>--they don't quite hold
up.

            So how to prevent outrage
at human suffering from tilting toward vile stereotyping? One guideline: The
more that anchormen get all huffy, the more you must be on your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX>
Rather reaches for the adjectives, be careful out there.
