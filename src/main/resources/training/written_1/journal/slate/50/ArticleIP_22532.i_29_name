            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar Alexander</ENAMEX> intends to
raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $15 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> for his presidential campaign. This raises a
critical question: How? How on earth does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar</ENAMEX> ("<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar</ENAMEX>!") <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX>, who has
been running for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> nonstop since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, convince <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> that his campaign is a reasonable investment?

            Let us stipulate:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> is a serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> who should be taken seriously as a serious
presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> by serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> everywhere. He served <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> successful
terms as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of education. He's
smart, thoughtful, and persistent. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, he has spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">120 days</TIMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>, more time than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prospect</ENAMEX>. For
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> he has dropped the absurd trappings of his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> campaign: A gray suit has
replaced the embarrassing plaid shirt, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar</ENAMEX>!" has become "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX>,"
and he has stopped playing the piano at campaign stops.

            Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> remains, as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> politely puts
it, an "extreme <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underdog</ENAMEX>." Recent polls of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caucus voters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>,
where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> claims to have the best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, show him in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> place
with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.7 percent</NUMEX>, behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Quayle</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, a recent poll found him
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 th</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> field with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 percent</NUMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC/ Wall Street</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> poll taken even before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> became a serious
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> only <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 percent</NUMEX> support among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Dole</ENAMEX>, and (to a lesser extent) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> are eating his lunch,
capturing the mainstream <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> on whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> depends.

            Why, then, would anyone
bother to fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX>'s campaign? (You could ask the same question about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX>.) To answer this riddle, I went to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> who know: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who
are funding his campaign. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX>'s presidential campaign doesn't have
to file contributor lists with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Election Commission</ENAMEX> till <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>, but
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEC</ENAMEX> does keep records for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campaign</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New American Century</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX>'s
main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNAC</ENAMEX> raised and spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $5 million</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996 to 1998</TIMEX>--including
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.7 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> alone--to fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX>'s unofficial presidential
campaign. I downloaded the list of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> CNAC <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> and interviewed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> of
them at random.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> are not exactly campaign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX>, but they
are close. All gave to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNAC</ENAMEX> in order to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX>'s presidential run, and
all but one say they have already donated or will donate to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX>'s
presidential campaign. Most of them are prosperous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businesspeople</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX>
and bordering <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> who can afford to give <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few thousand</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNAC</ENAMEX> and
another grand to the presidential campaign.

            Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexandrians I</ENAMEX>
contacted, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> consider themselves acquaintances of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> call themselves
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> (including an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX>, a godmother to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, and someone who
ate dinner with him the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night before</TIMEX>), and one is his brother-in-law. In other
words, only one of them doesn't know him, and most know him extremely
well. "He's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and I like him, and when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> asks for help, you give
him help," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Flanigan</ENAMEX>, who worked with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNAC</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5,000</NUMEX>. Now I doubt even the congenial <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and acquaintances, but he probably has enough to make a dent in that
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15 million</NUMEX>.

            Obviously, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and acquaintances are not
contributing simply out of affection. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> universally admire
his brains, decency, commitment to public service, and honor. They applaud his
stewardship of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> and his devotion to education. "He has a lot of
experience governing. He has the skills to carry out what he believes in. He
would be a very effective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Pomerantz</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexander</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who contributed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5,000</NUMEX>.

            Which brings us to the
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15 million</NUMEX> question: Do they actually believe he can be elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>?
They are optimistic but also more realistic than you might expect. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Sheffer</ENAMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contributor</ENAMEX>, admits that the odds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar</ENAMEX> winning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>
nomination are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15-to-1</NUMEX> against. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> all recognize that he would be
trounced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> if the primaries were held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. Instead they cling
to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-placism: Their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is the "strongest backup <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>," as one puts
it.

            They all paint me the same scene: "He has the best
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> will narrow it down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, and I think he will be one of them," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marty Connors</ENAMEX>, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist</ENAMEX> who gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNAC</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar</ENAMEX> may not be known
nationwide, but "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> know what he stands for. And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> are going to tell the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> who to vote for," says
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connors</ENAMEX>. Once <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar</ENAMEX> graduates from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>, they say, he will
rise to the top because he's so "electable."

            And how exactly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">will Alexander</ENAMEX> manage to finish <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>? A
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> calamity as well as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> collapse (and perhaps a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> implosion for
good measure). Being loyal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar</ENAMEX>'s contributors talk about such
happenings only obliquely. A few mention a "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> stumble," but most are even
more circumspect. "Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> could have something unfavorable in
their past. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> could get sick," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Van</ENAMEX>, who runs
a financial management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nashville</ENAMEX>.

            "Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> may be sexier at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this hour</TIMEX>, but once we
go through the battering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> it might be a different
story," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connors</ENAMEX>. "I think the subtext of this election will be, 'I will
not embarrass you.' I know with absolute certainty that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar Alexander</ENAMEX> is
without reproach."

            "The press will reveal
things about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> that otherwise would not be revealed," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carole</ENAMEX>
Sergent, a college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmate</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX>'s and godmother to one of his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. "There are no secrets with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar</ENAMEX>. But when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> scrutinize and see
what those front-runners are really about ..."

            Because they are relying on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> fade, the contributors
easily discount <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar</ENAMEX>'s dismal poll numbers. It's too early for the polls to
mean anything, they say. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Voters</ENAMEX> are probably still reacting to "that plaid
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shirt</ENAMEX>," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Black</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nashville</ENAMEX> software <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX>. The Alexandrians
reject the polls in favor of a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1996</ENAMEX> number: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,500</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> repeat this
figure as though it had talismanic power. If only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar</ENAMEX> had won <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,500</NUMEX> more
votes in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> primary, he would have edged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX> for
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, driven <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> out of the race, and cruised to the nomination. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>
near miss allows them to ignore the uglier facts of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>: that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar</ENAMEX> faces a
stronger field and has lower poll numbers.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> contributors
admire the doggedness that has made <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> a figure of fun to the press.
They call his nonstop campaigning since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> evidence of his persistence. "I
don't think you should make fun of anyone who has a strong desire for public
service. It takes hard work, and he will outwork all the others," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX> real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developer</ENAMEX>.

            The endless campaign has "tested" him in ways that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novice</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> can't even imagine. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> believe in
dues paying, say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX>. Over and over, they remind me that the
last <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> who won the presidency in his first campaign was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dwight</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eisenhower</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> lost before he was nominated, as did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>.

            The way the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> figure it, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> is
running against the other veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Buchanan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Forbes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alan</ENAMEX>
Keyes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX>. By that calculus, I suppose, a contribution to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar</ENAMEX> is a
great bet.
