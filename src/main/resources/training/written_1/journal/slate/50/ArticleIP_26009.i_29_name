            He would cut into the
belly
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, at the kitchen
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sink</ENAMEX>, Mother squabbling
in the background, and he'd be
up to his elbows in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>,
blood shining from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">knife</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> smelling of sweat,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boots</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, smoke, and though
I'd been at home,
in bed the whole time, I could
see the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puyallup River</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herons</ENAMEX>
rising, cattails and redwing
blackbirds with their bottlebrush
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shapes</ENAMEX> and streaks of color,
from shore to shore a thick fog,
but rolling up and off like smoke, a reel
singing as the steelhead ran
with the line, the hurry, the thrash
and splashing, feet stumbling
along the shore to keep up,
to keep the line from getting cut.
Surely this was a victory for them,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX> saying it's a female , then
he's pulled out the whole orange clump
to show my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX>.
Yes , he is saying, we'll use the roe
as our next bait , and How about
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday, early</TIMEX>? He holds them up
in front of the window, though I was never
actually there to see it, scales smeared
on the faucet, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hump</ENAMEX> between
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sinks, his forearms
all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> and orange on fire. The guts
and severed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> lay in a mass on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">papertowels</ENAMEX>. Light glinted thick
through the raised orange
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">globes</ENAMEX>. Yes, good thing this was a female.
