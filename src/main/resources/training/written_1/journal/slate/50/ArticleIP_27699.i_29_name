               The bombing campaign--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX> bombs and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> so far--is working,
says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klaus Naumann</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>'s senior military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>. "We will see
how they will feel after a few more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> or what have you of
continuously pounding them into pieces." However, he adds, "We may have one
flaw in our thinking." What?
            

            "What
if they just don't have feelings? (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Music swells ...</ENAMEX>)"-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. Mattick</ENAMEX>
            

            "The
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> won't tell us how to use any of our really good bombs."-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beth</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Sherman</ENAMEX>
            

            "Some
of the pieces we pound them into may still be large enough to commit
genocide."-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg Diamond</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al Petrosky</ENAMEX> had a similar answer.)

            "Oh,
sure, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>, the war may seem funny now, but what if our killing all those
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> inspires a violent video game? What about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>?"-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX>

"Because when you are up in the woods shooting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, you just think, 'Hey,

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert L. Ransome</ENAMEX>'s answer to an entirely different question about what
might inspire his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Manes</ENAMEX>, to sell a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEC-DC9</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minors</ENAMEX>. Still, a

Wrap-Up
            

            There was much less
resistance to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> question than to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbine</ENAMEX> quiz.
Perhaps because <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s has a clear foil, in uniform, speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>. It
doesn't get any comedier than that. Or because rationalization is worth
observing and mocking. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbine</ENAMEX> T-shirts, on the other hand, are a minor
crime; it is unbecoming to chide weeping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of the deceased for not
reacting in a more stylish way. It is appropriate, of course, to attack
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hand-wringing commentators</ENAMEX> who offer lame explanations for teen violence, and
many of you did--target <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX>; not offer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lame</ENAMEX> ... well, you know. (It is
curious how few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> connected <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbine</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stories displayed
side by side on every front page for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>--hmmm, where would these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> get
these violent ideas?) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> tactical problem emerged in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naumann</ENAMEX>'s
discussion. Because the bombing is continuing for longer than had been
anticipated, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> risks running out of targets. This is not a problem for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News</ENAMEX>
Quiz.

            
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flawless</ENAMEX>
Answer
            

            The flaw: Our plan won't
actually work because <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yugoslav</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX> is, like, so
irresponsible. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naumann</ENAMEX> puts it, "This flaw may be that we believe that
no responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who is at the helm of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX> can wish to
run the risk that his entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> will be bombed into rubble before he gives
up."

for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christine Todd Whitman</ENAMEX>, refers either to your ability to

shaking hands with newly arriving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX>.
