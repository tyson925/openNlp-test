            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> hate racism and
they love <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>, so maybe it's not surprising that prejudice among the pugs and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poodles</ENAMEX> is a growing national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>. Actually, the purported prejudice is
among <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>. But increasingly <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are being talked about as if
they had the same civil rights as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and that the same rules of civil
discourse apply to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and his best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> alike. The implied parallel can be
seen as either an insult to the struggle against human racism or a commentary
on its occasional excesses. Or, of course, it can be seen as perfectly
reasonable.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Complete Dog</ENAMEX>
Book was first published by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Kennel Club</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX>. Widely
considered the bible of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> breeding, it is essentially the blue book for dog
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">19 th edition</TIMEX> was released in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> but was recalled in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April of last year</TIMEX> because of an uproar from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeders</ENAMEX> who contended that the
book's "breed profiles" perpetrated pernicious stereotypes. The hottest issue
was that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog breeds</ENAMEX> had been reclassified as "not good" for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.

            Hardest hit by this development were dachshund and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Chihuahua</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeders</ENAMEX>, whose product is often sold to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>--and without warning
labels of any kind. (At least they are ostensibly for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. How many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>
have the guts to buy a dachshund without blaming it on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>?) On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>
News, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Caras</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> emeritus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Society for the</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</ENAMEX>, got right to the point: "To say that all
these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are 'this' and all these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are 'that,' that's racism, canine
racism." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Holder</ENAMEX>, the outraged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dachshund Club of America</ENAMEX>,
told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , "You just can't make such a blanket statement
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about dachshunds</TIMEX>."

            Wait. Why exactly can't
we make blanket statements about these ankle-snapping pipe cleaners with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">feet</NUMEX>?
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dogs</ENAMEX> are not vehicles stamped out of an assembly line," asserted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holder</ENAMEX>, "Each
one is an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>." <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A week</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKC</ENAMEX>'s announcement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vicki Hearne</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Animal Happiness</ENAMEX> , joined the battle in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
op-ed piece, where she raised the specter of genocide, or at least breed
cleansing. To brand dogs such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chihuahuas</ENAMEX> as "not good" with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> "is not
just an insult; it is a dangerous statement in an age when every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> and many
towns have adopted or are considering laws restricting, banning or even
requiring the killing of particular suspect breeds."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Dodman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tufts University Animal Behavior</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinic</ENAMEX> charged that labeling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chihuahuas</ENAMEX> as bad with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> was essentially
blaming the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX>: "It's mainly the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s fault because they're doing really
stupid things with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>." He told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>, "They're pulling on their tails and
pulling on their ears and poking in their eyes, and doing lots of things, and
you know, you have to have a pretty long fuse to tolerate that." The problem,
in other words, is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are bad with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chihuahuas</ENAMEX>. Perhaps the solution
is to ban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.

            Eventually the kennel
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">club</ENAMEX> caved like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denny's</ENAMEX> before a class action suit. The club recalled over
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> copies of its book--at a cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $800,000</NUMEX>--and declared that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">profiles</ENAMEX> had been published with "inadvertently incorrect and controversial
information." Also, "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKC</ENAMEX> sincerely regrets the distress caused to dog
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeders</ENAMEX> by the errors. AKC neither agrees with, nor endorses, the
material." This is a good start. But where, one wonders, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKC</ENAMEX>'s apology
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>?

            Don't ask me whether each of the breeds on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKC</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blacklist</ENAMEX> can accurately be labeled good or bad for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. But the idea that
stereotypes are not valid about breeds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> is ridiculous. While it is true
that all dogs go to heaven, there is a bowl curve when it comes to dog
abilities and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities</ENAMEX>. Basset hounds are sweet and stubborn. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden</ENAMEX>
retrievers are beautiful, joyous, dumb <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">blonds</ENAMEX>. Border collies work hard--even
when they're asleep. Mastiffs are lazy but lovable. Labradors are the kind of
dogs you want to have a beer with. Chihuahuas are snappish and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temperamental</ENAMEX>.

            Judging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> of their skin is different than judging <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> by the texture of their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coats</ENAMEX>. It is different even if you leave aside the question (which I find easy
but some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> find difficult) of whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> have the same moral claims as
human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX> to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Let's say they do.
Even if so, the analogy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog stereotypes</ENAMEX> to human racism is mistaken.

            Racism among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> is overwhelmingly based upon cultural
differences--what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeders</ENAMEX> might call "training." The actual genetic
differences between human "races" are so infinitesimal that making sweeping
statements is rarely useful and often dangerous. Genetic differences between
human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">races</ENAMEX> are literally superficial. But the differences between purebred
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are anything but. That's why they call it breeding. For example, border
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">collies</ENAMEX> instinctively herd anything that moves--without any training. Put a
border collie in the living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> during a cocktail party, and soon you'll find
everybody scrunched into the corner.

            Strong genetic
differences among <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog breeds</ENAMEX> are not just the result of natural selection.
Evolution among <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> has got a big push from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranches</ENAMEX>, border collie
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppies</ENAMEX> are taken from the litter and tested for their instinctual desire to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herd sheep</ENAMEX>. The most fearless and enthusiastic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pups</ENAMEX> are the most likely to be
bred to pass that herding gene on to the next generation.

            Doggy eugenicists sometimes disagree about what traits they
ought to be pushing. Many border <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">collie</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeders</ENAMEX>, for example, take great
exception to the dog industry's emphasis on ideal appearance rather than
behavior. They fear that if border collies are bred for the color of their
coats rather than the content of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>, eventually their herding
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">instinct</ENAMEX> will fade away.

            Another example is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pointers</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> need not be an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> in evolution or zoology to understand that
pointing at dinner rather than catching it is not a successful evolutionary
strategy. But the reason pointers point is not that they are responding to a
capital gains tax cut or any of the other incentives known to affect the
behavior of human beings. It is that pointing has been bred into them. Right
now, something called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Dog</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Genome</ENAMEX> Project is trying to isolate the various
genes for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breed</ENAMEX>-specific behaviors, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">basenji</ENAMEX>'s genetic reluctance
to bark and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">basset</ENAMEX>'s genetic refusal to catch <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Frisbees</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lovers</ENAMEX> of certain breeds readily acknowledge the positive
genetic tendencies of their favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> water
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> want pooches that can swim. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rottweiler</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> want <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts</ENAMEX> that
protect. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> shepherders like a good running <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddy</ENAMEX>. And, basset <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, like
me, want <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> that have the good sense not to do any of those things. But
suggest that negative behavior might be genetic too, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog nuts</ENAMEX>--and,
increasingly, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>--declare that this is like saying <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> are
naturally greedy or that laziness is a genetic trait of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>.

            Take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pit bull</ENAMEX>, the
most "discriminated against" <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. In most breeds, a litter of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppies</ENAMEX> will have one "alpha <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">alpha dog</ENAMEX> is the most aggressive male in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, the one that instinctively wants to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the pack and will
not bow out of a fight. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Pit bull litters</ENAMEX> are nearly all alphas. If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> lets
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pit bull</ENAMEX> gain alpha dominance, watch out: A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> party with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fido</ENAMEX> could turn
into a bloodbath. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pit bull</ENAMEX>'s brain chemistry is the product of selective
breeding too. Unlike, say, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> shepherd, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pit bulls</ENAMEX> were not bred to
protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> but to kill other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>. They are more prone to become addicted
to endorphins, which often translates into a lust for pain. Thus, they don't
quit when their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> is licked or when they are told to go to a neutral
corner. Also, most <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> have an instinctual body language. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> meet on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and they don't want to fight, they bow their heads, exposing their
necks and demonstrating their vulnerability. It's a nice gesture, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pit bulls</ENAMEX>
bow too. But unlike any other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breed</ENAMEX>, they have an instinct for attacking the
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> while he's still bowed.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Koch</ENAMEX> tried to impose strict
rules on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pit bull</ENAMEX> ownership. He called them, "the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great White Sharks</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doggiedom</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> ruled that such laws were prejudicial because of
their disparate impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of different breeds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>. Other cities
trying to curb <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pit bulls</ENAMEX> met with similar rulings. Since then, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> like the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Animal Legal Defense Fund</ENAMEX>--does the name sound familiar?--have been arguing
hard that the issue isn't <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>' rights but <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>' rights. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX> malpractice
cases and other instances of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> deaths, reports <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evan Gahr</ENAMEX> in the Wall
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Street Journal</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> frequently argue that compensation should be
determined by the "intrinsic value" of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> attack cases, animal
behaviorists, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychiatrists</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> try to claim that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> were
simply "misunderstood." But whether they're defending a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> that kills or
eulogizing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> that was killed, the mythology that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are simply products
of their environments holds sway.

            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't realize
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> were not made by God. Rather, God gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> the raw materials--the
ancient offshoot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wolf</ENAMEX>--and said "show me what you can do." Purebred dogs
have been selectively bred for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in some cases. Even a
millennium of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unnatural</ENAMEX> selection still leaves room for some environmental
influence: A cocker spaniel that wears a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Kick Dog for Service</ENAMEX>" sign from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">till 5</ENAMEX> will be a lot more likely to bite than a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rottweiler</ENAMEX> that grew up in a
loving home. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> will be closer than others to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aryan</ENAMEX> ideal of their
particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breed</ENAMEX>. But the worst herding border collie in the world will still
herd better than the most masterful <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> hairless.

            A poodle will bite you for forgetting to put the accent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mark</ENAMEX> over the "e" in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">André.</ENAMEX> But you could use a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bloodhound</ENAMEX>'s tail as a jump
rope and the worst you'd get is a fierce yawn. Yes, it is possible to teach a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bloodhound</ENAMEX> to hate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, just as it is possible to teach poodles to be sled
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>. But this would be conditioning against the grain of the breeds'
personalities. "Canine racism" may be a convenient way to shake down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX>. But it drains the moral currency from a very real and still
unfortunately useful concept in the world of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>.

            There is simply no such thing as canine racism. In
fact, some of my best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shepherds</ENAMEX>.
