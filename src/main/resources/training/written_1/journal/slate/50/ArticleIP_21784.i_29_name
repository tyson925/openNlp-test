            As <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Czech</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX> prepared to join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prague Post</ENAMEX> welcomed the
event <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> with the front-page headline: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dreams</ENAMEX> do come true." The paper
said, "The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Czech Republic</ENAMEX> has come full circle from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underdog</ENAMEX> in the dark days
of fascism and communism to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the world's strongest defense
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alliance</ENAMEX>." The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warsaw Voice</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>'s commitment to its new allies
will be immediately put to the test by the crisis in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>, to which it is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pledging</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> as part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> peacekeeping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">force</ENAMEX>.

            But in the West, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>'s
commitment to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> was looking wobbly. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> papers all led on
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Massimo D'Alema</ENAMEX>'s statement to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parliament</ENAMEX> that the
agreements on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. NATO</ENAMEX> bases in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> would have to be renegotiated if the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> failed to deliver justice for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpine</ENAMEX>
disaster in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skiers</ENAMEX> were killed by an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. A front-page
comment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corriere della</ENAMEX>
Sera of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX> called this "an audacious challenge to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>,
but one full of risks." A revision of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX> agreements will be difficult, it
said, because they were signed by all the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>, and above all it is important
to avoid a new wave of anti-Americanism. "We should not forget how important
the link with the sole superpower still is both to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> and to all of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>,"
it said.

            The other big story in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> was the visit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Khatami</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>, the first by an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> since
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>, which was soured by the coincidental, simultaneous presence in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salman Rushdie</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> condemned to death <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years ago</TIMEX>
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ayatollah Khomeini</ENAMEX> for allegedly blaspheming against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> religion in
his book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Satanic Verses</ENAMEX> . While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khatami</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rushdie</ENAMEX> was in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turin</ENAMEX> receiving an honorary degree from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> there, to the
embarrassment and anger of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, which had not been
informed.

            In an interview <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Repubblica of Rome</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khatami</ENAMEX> said he was "deeply displeased to see that
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who has offended the feelings and the religious beliefs of more than
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> faith throughout the world should be
encouraged in this way, thus perpetuating the conflict between our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">civilizations</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> reiterated that "the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has
explicitly stated that no action will be taken by our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to apply the
fatwa," but also emphasized that that sentence has been "approved and confirmed
by all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> took an even harsher line. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>
News accused the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> of "an incredible insult" and proposed
"a reappraisal of policy towards <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> which had been thought to be
friendly." The supposedly moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">daily</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kar-o-Kargar</ENAMEX> blamed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rushdie</ENAMEX>'s presence on the influence on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> of "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mafiosi</ENAMEX> and of arms <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> linked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>." The
conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jomhuri Islami</ENAMEX> claimed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ministry</ENAMEX>,
under the influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zionists</ENAMEX>, tried to orchestrate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> protests against
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khatami</ENAMEX> during his visit. On <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khatami</ENAMEX>'s meeting with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>'s Italian
papers highlighted an incident at the end of their talks in which an
unidentified mullah, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khatami</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX>, approached the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX> and
said in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Can</ENAMEX> I do something?" When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX> replied, "Of course," the
mullah leaned over and kissed him on the cheek.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> press comment focused <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Defense</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cohen</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> visit and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Libyan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muammar Qaddafi</ENAMEX>'s
views on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lockerbie</ENAMEX> dispute. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al-'Arab</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf</ENAMEX> tour had been successful as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>-selling exercise but a relative flop
politically because he had "failed to obtain the traditional show of collective
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf</ENAMEX> support for the policy of aggression his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> pursues against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>."
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tarek Massarwa</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jordanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentator</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al-Quds al-Arabi</ENAMEX> , blasted
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> for distancing themselves from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> policy in public
while colluding with it in private.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, the
leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">daily</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asharq al-Awsat</ENAMEX> quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Col.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qaddafi</ENAMEX> as snubbing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> over
its efforts to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> an agreement among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tripoli</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> for
the trial to go ahead in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Libyan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspects</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> bombing of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PanAm</ENAMEX> airliner over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Foreign Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amr</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mousa</ENAMEX> stated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lockerbie</ENAMEX> dispute was the main topic in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeklong</TIMEX> talks in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaddafi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hosni Mubarak</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Libyan</ENAMEX> leader
claimed that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> had no role in current efforts to reach a settlement, the
paper said. Talking to a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>, he implied that he
would prefer to rely on the continued mediation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>. He said that
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, as an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, enjoyed uneasy relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>. "Such problems don't exist between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mandela</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mandela</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>," the paper quoted him as saying. "On the contrary, they are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>."

            Interviewed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Soros</ENAMEX>, taking his first public position on the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
currency, the euro, which recently plummeted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
dollar, forecast that it is destined to be a weak currency because of
fundamental flaws in the structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Monetary Union</ENAMEX>. But the
interview was published before the resignation from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> government
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oskar Lafontaine</ENAMEX>, which caused an immediate 2
percent rise in the euro's value. The resignation of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Red Oskar</ENAMEX>," as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> press dubbed him, was warmly welcomed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>,
which reported that champagne bottles had been opened in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Downing Street</ENAMEX>.

            In an editorial, the
Times of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lafontaine</ENAMEX>'s departure "good news for both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>"
offering "some hope of a saner <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> economic policy" but, stressing his
continuing power on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">German Left</ENAMEX>, said he was likely to be "the most unquiet
ghost since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banquo</ENAMEX>." In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le Figaro</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Libération</ENAMEX> played the story as a major setback for socialism
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, as did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El País</ENAMEX> said it put both
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>'s ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> and the integration of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> at risk.
