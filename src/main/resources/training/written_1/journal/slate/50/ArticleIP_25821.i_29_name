            During the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> military action abroad invoked the domino theory: If
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> was allowed to fall to communism, many others would follow. In the
debate over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> military action (including many of
those former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX>) invoke a sort of reverse domino theory: If we save
anyone from mass murder or humanitarian disaster, we'll find ourselves doing it
again and again. Moral consistency requires us to do nothing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> because
we can't intervene every time a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thug</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yugoslav</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX>
decides to start slaughtering his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>.

            That's not the only
argument against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> intervention. But is it true? Would it really be an
impossible burden to stop every moral outrage on the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>?
Isolationist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> give the impression that the world outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> is a boiling cauldron of centuries-old ethnic rivalries, in which mass
slaughters are everyday occurrences. In fact, attempts at genocide are fairly
rare.

            The term "genocide" is often invoked rather wildly. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> love to talk about the "genocide" against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Baltic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, for example, while <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX> like to accuse
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> of committing "cultural genocide." But genocide has a precise and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">universally</ENAMEX> accepted definition: "acts committed with intent to destroy, in
whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>," according
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1951 Genocide Convention</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has
been using the term genocide cynically. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> studiously avoided the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G</ENAMEX>
word" in describing the killings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rwanda</ENAMEX>, where it clearly applied. By
contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Rubin</ENAMEX> has been tossing it around
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liberally</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few weeks</TIMEX>, even though human rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> say they
haven't yet been able to document that genocide is underway in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>.

            Suppose the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, along with its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>, put the
horse before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cart</ENAMEX> again and committed itself to stopping genocide wherever
it occurred. How many military actions would that have required in, say, the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past 10 years</TIMEX> (before <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>)? Answer: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> definites and one maybe. The
definites are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rwanda</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, while the maybe is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX>.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX>, genocide was
arguably underway <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as the summer of 1992</TIMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> did not
take military action until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. In the interim, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of lightly armed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> stumbled around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">blue helmets</ENAMEX>,
trying to feed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> and stay out of harm's way. This was a gruesome farce,
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> should have acted much earlier, with substantial
firepower, to overwhelm the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bosnian Serb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>.

            Unfortunately, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> have tended to explain genocides
as the spontaneous action of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> group motivated by insatiable hatred of
another. But that's not how genocides work. Yes, ethnic hatred runs deep in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balkans</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> had to deliberately fan it in order to start the war,
and the genocide, like all genocides, was planned and executed by a relatively
small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of extremely evil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rwanda</ENAMEX> is an even more
salient example of this. Perhaps because Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> knew so little
about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, their reporting suggested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hutu</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tutsi</ENAMEX> conflict was
so deeply rooted, it was unstoppable. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> hears it endlessly from "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>" on
TV talk shows: "These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have been killing each other for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, and there's nothing we can do about it." (Even if you know nothing about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hutu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tutsi</ENAMEX>, this argument has no logic. The point is that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ethnic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have been living in peace for a long period, and something happened to
destabilize that peace. That's why it's in the news, and that's why you, you
ignorant windbag, have been invited on television to discuss it.)

            In fact, a relatively small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hutu</ENAMEX> planned and
executed the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rwandan</ENAMEX> genocide. They had to coerce and intimidate many of their
fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hutu</ENAMEX> to go along with them--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hutu</ENAMEX> were also slaughtered in
the genocide for failing to join in. They used the mass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, especially
radio, to broadcast their bloody exhortations. And they used the silence of the
outside world--especially <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgium</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nations</ENAMEX>--to justify their actions.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX>'s gassing
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kurdish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> falls outside the arbitrary <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-year</TIMEX> rule.
From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1988</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> seized every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kurd</ENAMEX> in a vast
"prohibited area" and carted off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> for execution; it
also used chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kurdish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The outside world
did not know the full extent of the killing until reports after the fact. But
those reports established <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> as a genocidal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. So, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kurds</ENAMEX>
came under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> attack again, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, there was good reason to fear that
another genocide was in the offing (although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s real motivation
was defending the stability of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kurds</ENAMEX> were fleeing).

            Somalia technically was not a genocide. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992-93</TIMEX> famine
lacked the central direction of a genocide, and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> were not murdered
on the basis of race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion. But it was a
massive, politically inspired slaughter, which certainly justified foreign
intervention.

            The fact that I can't
resist including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX> shows the difficulty of maintaining any clear line
between situations that justify intervention and those that don't. No doubt
there would be other occasions that clearly met the standard where intervention
was unrealistic. For example, no reasonable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> would expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> to invade or bomb <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> to stop genocide against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kurds</ENAMEX>.

            But even a fuzzy and occasionally failed standard would be
an improvement on the ad hoc and random decisions we make now. A standard for
intervention that was universally accepted and regularly if not uniformly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> might even reduce the number of occasions when intervention would be
needed. If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> knew with reasonable certainty that ethnic cleansing
would be prevented and punished, he might not attempt it.

            The main point, though, is that there aren't
actually all that many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Milosevics</ENAMEX> in the world. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three and a half</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genocides</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and others actually did
intervene--albeit too late or ineptly--in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two and a half</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX>. Only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rwanda</ENAMEX> did the West stand by and do nothing. A cleaner
conscience is not an impossibly ambitious goal.
