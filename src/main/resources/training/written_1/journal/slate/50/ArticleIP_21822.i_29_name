            There's a well-known online
stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maven</ENAMEX> who calls himself <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TokyoMex</ENAMEX>. Like me, he manages money for clients
and also writes publicly about stocks. As we reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TheStreet</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TokyoMex</ENAMEX> is concerned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> is
building a case against him for "pump and dump." That means hyping a stock he
owns so the price goes up, and then dumping his shares on the public.

            Unlike me, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TokyoMex</ENAMEX> has
no formal disclosure policy about stocks he is writing about. In other ways--in
my opinion, based on press reports--he is clearly less responsible than I am
about the hazards of writing about small-capitalization stocks, which he can
move. Yet not a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, or broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> picked up
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TheStreet</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>'s scoop that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> is investigating him. His online following,
judging from press accounts, is much bigger than mine. And my record of giving
good financial guidance, publicly and privately, is better than his. So why the
fuss over me while other portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> write <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> about their stock
picks and get no heat?

            Let's establish some things up front. First, there is no
difference between a portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> who recommends stocks in an interview to
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>--which is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX> of financial journalism--and a
portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> who recommends stocks in a column of his own--which is
considered controversial--except that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> reveals his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">holdings</ENAMEX> while the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one doesn't have to.

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> would much rather hear from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> with real money on the line than it would from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> who are
trying to talk about a market that they are actually forbidden to invest in.
The success of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squawk Box on CNBC</ENAMEX>--the top-rated business show, which
has real live <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> co-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>--tells us this.

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> who
take an oath never to invest can't possibly be as good about the inner workings
of the market as those who do invest. I am in the trenches <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Journalists</ENAMEX> aren't allowed in the trenches. If you think the trenches matter
and, believe me, they matter as much in business as they do in war and in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX>, then you want me to write. You aren't going to get it another way.

            On the Net there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> writing
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>. But in the off-line press there are very few. Why? The heat, the
intense anger felt by the traditional off-line press as we invade their turf,
is searing. One look at the horrible press I get from other business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>
who are not portfolio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> would scare off almost anybody.

            The off-line writers
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sincerely</ENAMEX> want to see me fail. They want to drive a wedge between my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>
and me. They write with glee about my poor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year last year</TIMEX>--I was up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 percent</NUMEX>
vs. much higher <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S&P</TIMEX> results. What can I say? For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</TIMEX> I trounce the
averages and I blow it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX>. But I can tell you this: They don't take your
previous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>' gains away, and that is where my credibility comes from. I
wasn't the only hedge fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> who did poorly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, I was just the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> who was out front about it, constantly writing about how I blew the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> bottom in an endless series in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TheStreet</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>.

            The off-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> want me to stop writing and
trading. OK, let's say I stop trading. Would I be as good at writing about the
market as I am now? No way. I would just be another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> scrounging info.
To these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>, the fact that I was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> in chief of my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college paper</ENAMEX> more
than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades ago</TIMEX> might be considered a plus, but the fact that I am
actually doing this stuff is a big minus. Especially because in the third
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter of 1998</TIMEX> I lost money! Holy cow!!

            OK, then how about if I
stop writing? My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> would like it. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> would love
it because it would leave them the playing field to themselves. Ah, but there
is a problem. I don't write for the money, and I don't write for the notoriety,
so giving them up wouldn't hurt. So why not?

            Because I believe that the public needs to know more about
its own money. Because, until recently with online trading, the whole industry
I work in was predicated on the ignorance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX>. The industry wants
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to be kept in the dark so it can charge more for its services. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> who would stop me are complicit with that ignorance and are willing
tools of those that would like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> to have to rely on those who charge
high commissions or high fees to unknowing, worried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> of finance. I
want to use my successful background as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insider</ENAMEX> to change that. In other
words, I write because I think it is right.

            Unless the established business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> wants to repeal my <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> rights, they are stuck with me. I
am not going away on my own accord. Ultimately, what I say in my defense is
completely meaningless. If my comments or reports from the trenches are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">worthless</ENAMEX>, nobody will read them and I will disappear from the writing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">firmament</ENAMEX>.

            So then, what's behind
all the brouhaha about my writings? (See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Abelson</ENAMEX>'s column in the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barron's</ENAMEX> .) I believe
it is because of their popularity that I draw such heat and it is the fear of
the marketplace that drives my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist opponents</ENAMEX> to such distorted attacks
against me. They could care less about my ethics.
