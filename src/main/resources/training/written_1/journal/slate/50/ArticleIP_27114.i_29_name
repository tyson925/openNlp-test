            In
recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Rifle Association</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> have argued that
additional gun laws would not have helped avert the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 20</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>
high-school massacre, because gun laws already on the books proved useless. Why
propose "more gun laws" since the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killers</ENAMEX> had broken "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> laws" anyway,
asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conference</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.C. Watts Jr.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Okla.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX>
presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Bauer</ENAMEX> ("<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> laws were violated") and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>
Majority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miss.</ENAMEX>, ("<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 to 19</TIMEX> laws ... We have lots of laws
on the books") echoed this construction. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRA</ENAMEX>'s latest tally, provided to

                  Slate
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, lists <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> laws allegedly violated in the massacre.
But on closer inspection, the list evaporates.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A. Distractions</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> laws cited by the NRA concern
bombs.

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Possession of a
"destructive device" (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>).
            

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Manufacturing a
"destructive device" (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>).
            

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Use of an explosive
or incendiary device in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> of a felony.
            

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
Setting a device designed to cause an explosion upon being triggered.
            

            What
do bomb laws have to do with gun laws? According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRA</ENAMEX>, nothing.
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Incredibly</ENAMEX>, we've been asked if we would support an instant check on
explosives purchases," <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wayne LaPierre</ENAMEX> noted with disgust in
a speech at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRA</ENAMEX> convention. "Well, I don't have to tell you, we're
not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Explosives Association</ENAMEX>." So, why does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRA</ENAMEX> include bomb
laws on its list? To pad the total.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tautologies</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX> other laws on the list
concern the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> to commit the massacre.

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. Use of a firearm or
"destructive device" (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>) to commit a murder that is prosecutable in a
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>.
            

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. Possession of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">firearm</ENAMEX> or "destructive device" (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>) in furtherance of a crime of
violence that is prosecutable in a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>.
            

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. Brandishing a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">firearm</ENAMEX> or "destructive device" (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>) in furtherance of a crime of
violence that may be prosecuted in a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>.
            

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. Discharging a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">firearm</ENAMEX> or "destructive device" (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>) in furtherance of a crime of
violence that may be prosecuted in a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>.
            

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>. Conspiracy to
commit a crime of violence prosecutable in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>.
            

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>. Possession of a
firearm on school property.
            

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>. Discharge of a
firearm on school property, with a reckless disregard for another's
safety.
            

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>. Intentionally
aiming a firearm at another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>.
            

            

               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>. Displaying a firearm in a public place in a manner calculated to
alarm.
            

            The
salient feature of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> laws is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killers</ENAMEX> violated them
during the massacre, not beforehand. To say that these laws were
violated is merely to say that the massacre happened, i.e., that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
walked into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and brandished, aimed, and discharged firearms in a manner
calculated to alarm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, endanger the safety of others, and further a crime
of violence. It is meaningless to bring up these laws in a discussion of
prevention. Like murder laws, they are designed to prevent a killer's second
crime, not his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> 
               Laws not violated or not known to have been
violated.
            

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>. Possession of a
handgun by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under age 18</TIMEX>.
            

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>. Providing a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">handgun</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under age 18</TIMEX>.
            

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>. Licensed dealers
may sell <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX> and shotguns only to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 18</TIMEX> or over, and handguns to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 21</TIMEX> or over. ... <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Persons</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under age 18</TIMEX> are prohibited from possessing
handguns from anyone (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> or not).
            

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Possession,</ENAMEX>
interstate transportation, sale, etc., of a stolen firearm.
            

            

               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>. Possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.
            

            "It is
not known, however, whether the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perpetrator</ENAMEX> possessed the handgun
used in the crime," concedes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRA</ENAMEX>. The other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perpetrator</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 years old</TIMEX>.
According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who evidently bought the gun
and passed it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killers</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 years old</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> don't know
whether he "sold, gave or lent the gun or which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gunman</ENAMEX> ... was the recipient."
As for the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> says the 17-year-old
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">perpetrator</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> "has admitted buying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> shotguns and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rifle</ENAMEX> for him. But she was not charged because it is legal in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> for a
minor to own shotguns and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX>." There is no evidence that any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>
was stolen. Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRA</ENAMEX> concedes that it has only been "suggested that at
least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">firearms</ENAMEX> used in the crime had an obliterated serial
number."

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.</ENAMEX> 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duplicates</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> statutes on the list ban
possession of certain kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, essentially duplicating other statutes
on the list that ban acquisition of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>.

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>. Possession of a
short-barreled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun</ENAMEX>.
            

            

               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>. Possession of a handgun by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under age 18</TIMEX>.
            

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. Formalities</ENAMEX>. So the list of relevant laws known to have
been violated boils down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>:

            

               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>. Manufacturing a "sawed-off" <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun</ENAMEX>.
            

            This
law prohibited the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perpetrators</ENAMEX> from making a sawed-off <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun</ENAMEX>. However,
no law prohibited them from acquiring both a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun</ENAMEX> and a saw. So this law
means nothing.

            Would
the additional laws proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> have made any
difference? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of them would prohibit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18- to 20-year-olds</TIMEX> from possessing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">handguns</ENAMEX>. If that law had been passed and effectively enforced, it would have
prevented the elder <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gunman</ENAMEX> from acquiring the handgun used in the massacre.
Another of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s proposals would hold negligent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> liable for crimes
committed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. This law might or might not have prompted
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killers</ENAMEX> to intervene before the massacre.

            It is
always possible that more gun laws would not have helped. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRA</ENAMEX>'s bogus
list proves nothing.
