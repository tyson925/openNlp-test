Face
            

            What is especially enjoyable about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
Party's agony over abortion is that the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> lights are almost
surely pro-choice in their hearts. Not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Buchanan</ENAMEX> and not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Bauer</ENAMEX>, but
they're not the ones doing the agonizing. The agonizers are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Dole</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>, and their agony isn't moral, goodness knows.
It's political: How to prevent the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>'s hard-line pro-life stance from
driving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> away.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Forbes</ENAMEX> and the rest all claim to share the
hard-line anti-abortion view, as they must in order to be leading <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX>
lights in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place. But who believes them? Does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liddy Dole</ENAMEX> really think
abortion is equivalent to infanticide? Is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. mourning</ENAMEX> over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of
murdered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>? Not likely. So they must pretend to a deep moral
belief they probably don't have, then pretend to have come up with a reason
this deep moral belief shouldn't really matter. Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> might have
trouble executing this double-reverse flip-flop fib off the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>. Are
lesser <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pols</ENAMEX> up to it?

            The official <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> position on abortion, as expressed
in the past <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX>, is so extreme that if it were taken seriously,
no <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> could be elected to any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> except, perhaps, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX>. Fortunately
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>, few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> are aware of it, fewer still understand it, and those
who do understand it assume correctly that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> doesn't really mean
it.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> reads: "The
unborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> has a fundamental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> right to life which cannot be
infringed. We support a human life amendment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> and we endorse
legislation to make clear that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fourteenth Amendment</ENAMEX>'s protections apply to
unborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">14 th Amendment</ENAMEX> guarantees all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> "the
equal protection of the laws." If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> under the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">14 th Amendment</ENAMEX>, an abortion must be treated exactly like the
premeditated killing of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX>--that is, like <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-degree murder. There can
be no exceptions for rape or incest. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who procures an abortion is
guilty of murder just as if she had hired a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gunman</ENAMEX> to kill her born offspring.
In a death penalty <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>--and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> platform favors the death penalty,
naturally--she must pay with her life.

            The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> platform goes
on to say, "we have only compassion" for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who procure abortions and "our
pro-life agenda does not include punitive action" against them. Which only
shows that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> does not even believe itself, since that stuff about
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">14 th Amendment</ENAMEX> can have no other meaning.

            But the current <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> position is logically
consistent. If full human life begins at conception, then full human rights do
too, including the right to equal protection of the laws. It is a concept that
does not easily lend itself to compromise, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> presidential
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contenders</ENAMEX> are demonstrating. Their search for a way out has led most of them
to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rhetorical strategies.

            One is the notion the
late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Atwater</ENAMEX> called "the big tent." There's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> for everybody. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX>
says about the abortion issue, "I believe we are an inclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> and we can
be so without changing our principles." What does this mean? Does it mean that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> should feel free to vote <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> even if they disagree with what the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Party</ENAMEX> stands for? A nice offer, though I wouldn't expect many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">takers</ENAMEX>. Or does it mean that because there are so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to divvy up, the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> needn't stand for anything in particular? Not a big vote-getter
either.

            Asked about abortion <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Nicholson</ENAMEX> also invoked what is apparently the
party-line phrase: "inclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>." He elaborated, "We want to reach out and
grow this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>. ...We're recognizing that there are differences. This is a
huge <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. It's a continent really. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">270 million</NUMEX> of us, and there
are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>. So why wouldn't we have some differences?"

            It's surely true that it
would be suicidal for a party to demand agreement on all issues from either its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> or its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>. The tricky question is what are the core values that
really define you and what are the fringe issues on which differences are not
crucial. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> would prefer not to be defined by their position on
abortion. But if you take it seriously, the anti-abortion position is
definitive by definition. How can you make the capital gains tax a litmus test
issue but say that the slaughter of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> is something
about which you have only a mild preference and don't care much if people
disagree? The truth is that most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> don't actually take their
alleged position on abortion seriously. But they can't admit this.

            The other rhetorical way out for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> is
to say that you yourself are as hard-core as ever, but since a majority of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> apparently disagrees, there's no point in trying to do anything about
it it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Dole</ENAMEX> goes further: There's no point in even discussing it.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX> she called on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to "set an example" and "refuse to be
drawn into dead-end debates" about something that is "not going to happen."
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W.</ENAMEX>, sounding like a very promising cross between his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX>, explained in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> why he opposes pushing for a constitutional
amendment, although he favors one himself: "There are a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> who
don't view the abortion issue as a matter of life. I do. That's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason why
I'm a pro-life <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>."

            This is an imaginative
attempt to dress craven pragmatism as high principle, but it makes no sense.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> are littered with proposals that are
"not going to happen." Almost nothing is going to happen if a majority must
already favor it before any political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> will speak out in its favor. If
she actually believed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of human lives were at stake, the former
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Cross</ENAMEX> surely wouldn't try to build a holy crusade around
refusal to discuss the matter. Nor would she blame the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> for an "inordinate
focus" on the issue.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar Alexander</ENAMEX>'s way out is worth noting, though it
doesn't rise to the level of illogic. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar</ENAMEX> says that we should "move
state-by-state to change laws and culture so there will be fewer abortions,"
and therefore "I do not support a constitutional amendment that would overturn
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Roe vs. Wade</ENAMEX> ." Well, you see, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Roe vs. Wade</ENAMEX> held that state
anti-abortion laws are unconstitutional. That's what it was all about!
Maybe--to give him the extreme benefit of the doubt--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar</ENAMEX> means that he favors
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overturning Roe</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> decision rather than by constitutional
amendment. This is an unlikely occurrence and, combined with the state-by-state
business, a rather leisurely approach if you honestly believe that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">slaughter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">innocents</ENAMEX> is going on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>.

            Finally, since the subject is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>, logic,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jurisprudence</ENAMEX>, and advanced metaphysical speculation, you're probably wondering
where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Quayle</ENAMEX> comes down. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX> agrees with everybody else that a
constitutional amendment is not going to happen. "But that's not
important . The important issue is where you stand on this
important debate. I have always been pro-life." In other words, as long as you
profess to believe that human life begins at conception and that abortion is
murder, it's not important whether you actually do anything about it.

            This is, of course, a truer statement of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> position on abortion than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>'s. But it is more than
that. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX> may actually have produced a compromise in what seemed to be a war
of moral absolutes. Speaking, if I may, for the pro-choice side of the debate:
Pro-lifers may profess any principles they care to, as long as they agree not
to act on them. They can actually believe what they say, for all I care. Though
I doubt, in the case of most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, that this last
concession will be necessary.
