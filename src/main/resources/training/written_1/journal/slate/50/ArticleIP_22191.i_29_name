            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A year ago</TIMEX> I was living in
a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$150,000</NUMEX> apartment, which I owned. It was a small, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-room <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>. Now I
am living in a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$175,000</NUMEX> apartment, which I own. It is also a small <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-room
apartment. In fact, it is the same apartment, although a little shabbier. A
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year ago</TIMEX> I could have sold the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$150,000</NUMEX>. Now I can sell it for
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$175,000</NUMEX>.

            Am I richer? I would
have <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25,000</NUMEX> more in cash if I sold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> vs. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX>. But money is a
sterile thing, good only for what it will buy. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$175,000</NUMEX> will buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62,724</NUMEX>
packages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Product</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>, whereas <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$150,000</NUMEX> would have bought only
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53,763</NUMEX> packages, so I am richer in Product <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>. I do not, however, live on
Product <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> alone.

            We are accustomed to the idea that we should convert all
dollar amounts to "real" values by adjusting with the consumer price index.
Because the CPI rose by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January to January</TIMEX>), the
value of my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> rose by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 14.7 percent</NUMEX> in terms of the goods and
services included in the CPI, rather than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.6 percent</NUMEX> by which it rose in
terms of dollars.

            But if I sell my
apartment, I probably won't use the proceeds to buy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that month</TIMEX>'s assortment of
stuff that's in the CPI. I will probably want to buy some other asset that will
yield a stream of income into the future. I could, for example, buy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30-year</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1998</TIMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$150,000</NUMEX> from my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> sale would have
bought bonds with a total yield of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8,925</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1999</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$175,000</NUMEX> I
can buy such bonds with a yield of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$9,730</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. In those terms I have got
richer.

            But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds are not what make everyone feel richer
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>. I might want to be more venturesome in the hope of getting a
larger--though riskier--income stream. Suppose I buy shares in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX> 500
Index. The price of that index rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21.3 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX> (to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>). Since the price of my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> rose by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 16.6 percent</NUMEX>, I can buy only
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96.1 percent</NUMEX> as much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">S&P 500</ENAMEX> as I could have bought <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX>. But
what I care about is how much future income I will get. If the future income
from the stocks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">S&P 500</ENAMEX> has risen by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 percent</NUMEX> per share, I would be
getting as much future income from buying in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> as I would have got from
buying in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. But I really don't know whether it has risen that much. So, I
don't know whether the shares of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">S&P 500</ENAMEX> I can buy for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$175,000</NUMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1999</TIMEX> are worth more than the shares I could have bought in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1998</TIMEX> I could
have bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,859</NUMEX> shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$150,000</NUMEX> price of my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1999</TIMEX> I can buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,084</NUMEX> shares. Am I richer or poorer in terms of the
opportunity to earn income from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>? Possibly the probable income from
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,084</NUMEX> shares is greater than the probable income from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,859</NUMEX> shares was.
But I don't know.

            So am I richer than I was? The rise in the price tag of my
apartment, combined with the changes in prices of other things, changes the
opportunities I face. I have an opportunity to get more cash, more Product <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>,
and more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> income from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds. In those terms I have become
richer. In terms of opportunity to enjoy living in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>, I am neither
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">richer</ENAMEX> nor poorer. I have become poorer in terms of my opportunity to buy the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S&P 500</ENAMEX> and even poorer in terms of my opportunity to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>.
Whether I have become richer or poorer in opportunity to earn income from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S&P 500</ENAMEX> or from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> I don't know, and neither does anyone else.

            I suppose we do know
something about who has got richer or poorer relative to others in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who owned shares in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> has got richer relative to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who owned the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">S&P 500</ENAMEX>, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> has got richer relative to
me, and I have got richer relative to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who produced the stuff that
went into the CPI, and they have got richer relative to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who had
cash. I guess I am richer relative to the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> who wants to earn the
cost of my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> by writing essays for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1</NUMEX> a word.

            The wealth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> is its future stream of national
income. That stream is almost certainly a rising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Year</TIMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, and little
by little, we are as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>--taking us all together--getting richer. But that
has little to do with, and is much less than, the surge in asset prices in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past two years</TIMEX>. Wealth is not wealth that alters when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> speaks.

            And yet, and yet, despite these uncertainties I
feel richer when the price tag on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> I live in goes up. That may be
an illusion, but illusions are facts of life.
