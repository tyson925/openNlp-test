            Do the supermarket tabloids
need a serotonin reuptake inhibitor? In the post-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flytrap</ENAMEX> world they seem to be
too depressed to get out of bed and find themselves dwelling instead on the
details of their unhappy relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, brooding about
mortality, and fixating on the sad lives of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who can only be called
obscure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX>.

            The tabs never liked the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> story all that much: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> is not their natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milieu</ENAMEX>, and in
general the mainstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> had better <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and reported more explicit
details. The tabs found themselves usurped in this scandal-enriched world, and
it showed in declining circulation. But now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Enquirer</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> are about to enter a new phase. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</TIMEX> the sister
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications</ENAMEX> were bought for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300 million</NUMEX> by an investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> headed by
former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Altman</ENAMEX>. Does this
mean tab <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> can expect a lot more monetary policy and a lot less <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Monica</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pulkes</ENAMEX> ?

            Like discarded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> who keep driving past their ex's
imagining the lurid scenes that are taking place inside, the tabs can't quite
let go of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>. Forget running for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> or being
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX>'s
real goal after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s term ends is "to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill</ENAMEX> under her thumb for the
rest of his life as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">'payback</ENAMEX>.' " While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> alleges his post-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> goal is to get a divorce, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> will refuse, threatening to "reveal
secrets about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> that would leave him utterly humiliated." The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> doesn't speculate as to what these might be, but what's left?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bestiality</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cannibalism</ENAMEX>? That's possible compared with what the publication
goes on to report--that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> insisted that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of them watch the
broadcast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>'s videotaped testimony, during which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> mumbled,
"Poor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>, I'm sorry she had to go through this." It is much more likely
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> would simultaneously send ground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX> than
mumble something like that in front of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> has come
up with its own bizarre denouement for this drama. It reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> would
like to talk to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> to plead forgiveness. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> she longs to
tell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> ... 'I'll do anything to make things right with you.' " Probably
the only thing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> can do that would bring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> any satisfaction is to
keep the feed bag tied on. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> also alleges that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> got so far
as to call the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first lady</ENAMEX> on her private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> line but lost the nerve to
speak when she heard <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX>'s voice. However, it does seem more likely that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> is a cannibal than that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> has been receiving
annoying hang-up calls from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Star</ENAMEX> at least emerges as the engine behind the
latest story--that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rapist</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> it published a quite
accurate account of what has emerged as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juanita Broaddrick</ENAMEX>'s story. It also
reported that there were rumors during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1992</TIMEX> presidential campaign that the
reason <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broaddrick</ENAMEX> didn't come forward with her story of being sexually
assaulted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX> was that her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> had cut a deal with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clintons</ENAMEX>. Broaddrick was furious when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> showed her the charge, and she
decided that it was time to tell the truth. But none of the tabs, including the
Star , has anything to add to the now public story--.

            If the tabs haven't
really been able to move on, neither has <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>, reports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> .
Her new plan is to win Bill back by starring on her own TV talk show. An
"insider" says, "She honestly believes that some day when she's a huge success
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> will want her back in his life." According to the story, one reason
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> decided to do her first interview with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Walters</ENAMEX> is because
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walters</ENAMEX> promised to introduce <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the industry. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Psst</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>,
don't forget that at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time, while she was trying to get the interview with
you, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walters</ENAMEX> was also the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of your erstwhile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ginsberg</ENAMEX>.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> acknowledges she's a sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addict</ENAMEX>
and as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step to get control of her compulsion "has thrown away all her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sexy</ENAMEX>, seductive lingerie." It's terrible to think of that great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">artifact</ENAMEX>, the thong of thongs, ending up in the dumpster.

            With the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> sex scandal now fading into embers, the
tabs have entered a dark, morbid phase. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This week</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> has a
story about the "deathbed vigil" for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Fortensky</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Taylor</ENAMEX>'s most
recent former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, the one-time construction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> she met when they were
both in rehab. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortensky</ENAMEX> suffered severe brain damage in a fall down a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staircase</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> , it was a drunken fall.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> has alleged it was a suicide bid. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> believes it
may have been a murder attempt. A caption on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> 's horrifying
picture of the critically injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fortensky</ENAMEX> is "touching family photo." Ah,
yes, there's nothing more moving than family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> "sharing" their
photographs of comatose loved ones for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>.

            The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-year old</TIMEX> murder of
child beauty pageant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JonBenet Ramsey</ENAMEX> returns to the covers of the tabs.
Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe and the Enquirer</ENAMEX> now point the finger at her
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patsy</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> promising, "indictments are imminent against
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JonBenet</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patsy</ENAMEX> for murder and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> for his role in a cover-up.
The conclusion the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">grand jury</ENAMEX> is considering is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patsy</ENAMEX> slammed a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bed-wetting JonBenet</ENAMEX> over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. ... It was a fatal wound. All the rest--the
strangling, sexual abuse, the ransom note--is cover-up."

            And not even a counseling session with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elizabeth</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kübler-Ross</ENAMEX> would help the tabs get over the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX>
weighs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> with its theory that her death was the result of an
assassination conspiracy among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Agency</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MI6</NUMEX> to keep
her from marrying department store <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heir</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dodi Fayed</ENAMEX>.

            Finally, the tabs have been wallowing recently in
the misery of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you can't remember or never heard of. Take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dana Plato</ENAMEX>.
Drawing a blank? She was a child star on the old sitcom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diff</ENAMEX>'rent
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Strokes</ENAMEX> . Since then she's been arrested on robbery and drug charges. Now,
in a "heartfelt exclusive interview," in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> , a lesbian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX>
of hers has announced that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plato</ENAMEX> has vanished after stealing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$700</NUMEX> from her.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plato</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> is worried the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> "is on a downward spiral to
death."

            And can anybody remember <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Renee Richards</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transsexual</ENAMEX> tennis-playing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richards</ENAMEX>, now <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> and a successful
pediatric ophthalmologist, advises other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who want, as she did, to change
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genders</ENAMEX> in middle age not to do it, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> . "You better
get on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thorazine</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zoloft</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prozac</ENAMEX>," she advises. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richards</ENAMEX>, can you write
a prescription for the tabloids?
