Wrap-Up
               

            

            By rights, this story should have taken place in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, the most cuteness-loving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> on earth and, coincidentally, the most
pornography-laden <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> on the planet and hence a popular destination for
vacationing animated space monsters. With perky breasts. And huge, adorable
eyes. Whose crazy adventures are recounted in comic books available in vending
machines on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> of every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> train <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. So what are we to make
of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Hello Kitty</ENAMEX>-porn juxtaposition?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty Boop</ENAMEX>. That was the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> manifestation of a big-eyed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>-talking erotic ideal, a sexual
fashion that's come and gone. (It is gone, right? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poppin' Fresh</ENAMEX>--he's a whole
other thing, right?) Perhaps in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> the cute and the concupiscent do not
coincide but coexist as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct phenomena. Like here in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
with sex and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza</ENAMEX>. Still separate, right? Could I have that with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pepperoni</ENAMEX>?

Answer
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bubbly Chubbies</ENAMEX> must be destroyed because they're a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">knock-off of Teletubbies</ENAMEX>.

            The suspiciously cuddly and maybe just a little too
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">adorable</ENAMEX> dolls, on sale in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,435</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, threaten the
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$800-million</NUMEX>-a-year business generated by the originals. Even the name was
chosen "deliberately to rhyme with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teletubbies</ENAMEX>," charged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> for the Itsy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bitsy Entertainment Company</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teletubbies</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>.

            "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> would never
knowingly infringe anyone's copyright," said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Maher</ENAMEX>.
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Can</ENAMEX> I offer you a drink--a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Croaka-Cola</ENAMEX>, or maybe something stronger, like a
shot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Spaniels</ENAMEX>?" he didn't add.
