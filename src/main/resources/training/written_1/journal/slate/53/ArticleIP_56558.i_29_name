            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Levinson</ENAMEX> has said
that his new movie, 
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberty Heights</ENAMEX>
               , was born when a magazine
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> made a breezily derisive reference to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewishness</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dustin Hoffman</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levinson</ENAMEX>'s dud sci-fi picture <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sphere</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>). Why, he asked,
make an issue out of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>'s ethnicity? The barbs of that (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>) critic
don't seem like such a big deal to this (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX>, but in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levinson</ENAMEX> they
clearly touched a nerve. Trounced a nerve, even. He has responded the way his
teen-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alter ego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Kurtzman</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Foster</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> respond in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberty</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Heights</ENAMEX> when they defy a sign on a local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pool</ENAMEX> that reads, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No Jews, Dogs</ENAMEX>,
or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coloreds Allowed</ENAMEX>." He's saying, "You got a problem with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>? I'll show
you <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>!"

            Does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levinson</ENAMEX> fully understand what teed him off?
The charismatic young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Diner</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>), his first autobiographical
work (and his masterpiece), weren't labeled as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>, and its most memorable
turns were by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mickey</ENAMEX>. In his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> on-screen visit to
his native <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avalon</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>), the milieu finally was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> was more interested in making sweeping points about
the cultural fragmentation of the central <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant family</ENAMEX>--and, by extension,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>--than in exploring his tribal or religious roots. (That
family was impersonated by those <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hebrews Aidan Quinn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Perkins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Armin</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mueller-Stahl</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Plowright</ENAMEX>.) The point is: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levinson</ENAMEX> airbrushed the
Jewishness out of his movie memoirs, and that review must on some level have
shamed him--made him feel as if he'd been dodging the issue.

            The problem, I think, is
that he's still dodging the issue. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levinson</ENAMEX> might be so assimilated by now that
he barely remembers what would impel someone to filter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewishness</ENAMEX> out of
his or her autobiographical alter egos. On the basis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> depicted in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberty Heights</ENAMEX> , he hardly seems to remember what a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX> is--only what a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jew</ENAMEX> is not. It's not a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WASP</ENAMEX>. It's not an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX>. As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">exclusively Jewish Liberty Heights</ENAMEX> section of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX>, being <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> was just
being ; it was when he perceived his "otherness," the movie suggests,
that a more complicated relationship to the world began.

            That's what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Liberty Heights</ENAMEX> attempts to recapture.
The movie opens in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</TIMEX>, when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX> first pokes his head out of his
neighborhood and when desegregation is starting to bring together disparate
ethnic and racial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> are not only interacting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WASPs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>;
in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX> and his older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adrien Brody</ENAMEX>), they're falling
for them--much to the horror of the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>, both white and black. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX>
takes a shine to a "colored" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rebekah Johnson</ENAMEX>), who sneaks him into her
(upper-middle-class) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and introduces him to rock 'n' roll and to comedians
who make fun of white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Van</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddies</ENAMEX> crash a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Halloween</TIMEX>
party on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WASP</ENAMEX> side of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van</ENAMEX> goes gaga for a chill blonde goddess
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carolyn Murphy</ENAMEX>) in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fairy-godmother</ENAMEX> ensemble--the supreme <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shiksa</ENAMEX>. Even their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Mantegna</ENAMEX>), is forced to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> himself with non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of
a dying burlesque <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> whose side business, the illegal numbers racket, has
become his lone source of income, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nate</ENAMEX> loses a fortune to a small-time black
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Melvin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orlando Jones</ENAMEX>)--a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loose cannon</ENAMEX> who ultimately
threatens his livelihood and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levinson</ENAMEX>'s remarks about
the review of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sphere</ENAMEX> --which was released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only last year</TIMEX>--suggest
something else about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Liberty Heights</ENAMEX> : that it was written fast.  That
might not be a problem if its canvas weren't so broad, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levinson</ENAMEX> doesn't
work simply anymore. He wants to make an epic. So he spreads the narrative
thin, and the script plays like a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> draft. It's full of wonderful bits that
don't mesh (some of them could be spun off into their own movies) and with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> conceived either too coarsely or too vaguely. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Melvin</ENAMEX> is a
flaming racist outrage, and I can't make any sense out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trey</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justin</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers</ENAMEX>), a glamorous, rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">WASP</ENAMEX> who's fond of crashing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and who takes
such a liking to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Van</ENAMEX> that he appears to be foisting his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX>--the blonde
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">goddess</ENAMEX>--on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX>. Is this Aryan guilt, or does he really want to jump <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bones</ENAMEX>? No clue from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX>, who look uniformly marooned.

            The crosscutting among the movie's various strands is even
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">weirder</ENAMEX>. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Van</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddies comb</ENAMEX> wealthy neighborhoods for a glimpse of
his shiksa, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nate</ENAMEX> auditions a stripper whose costume doesn't arrive and who ends
up doffing her conservative street clothes on stage to wild acclaim. Is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levinson</ENAMEX> drawing a parallel here--saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> are turned on by WASPs
because they're so buttoned-up? (I think, alas, he is.) And when he crosscuts
between a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Brown</ENAMEX> concert and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WASP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> is he saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> are
turned on by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> are so unbuttoned--because they shake,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rattle</ENAMEX>, and roll? (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ditto</ENAMEX>.) Is he saying that coming of age as a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX> means
learning to embrace both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate</ENAMEX> and vanilla?

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX>, retreats into
generic memory-play mode: "If I'd known things would no longer be, I'd have
tried harder to remember them." Loss of the past--that's a universal theme, a
"gentile" theme. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> has backed away from what appears to be his real,
more local, theme, which is the tug of war within <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American Jews</ENAMEX> of his
generation between a compulsion to embrace other cultures and a feeling of
superiority toward them. That idea is hilariously embodied by his best
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">character, Van</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yussel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Krumholtz</ENAMEX>), who starts a brawl when he
gets his nose rubbed in his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Jewishness</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WASP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> and shows up for the
next with his hair dyed blond and with a tale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nordic</ENAMEX> ancestry. I wish there
were more of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yussel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ben</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van</ENAMEX>, who are both unforgivably wide-eyed and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marshmallowy</ENAMEX>. Their blandness neuters what should be the movie's reason for
being.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberty Heights</ENAMEX>
is less gaseous than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avalon</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>' exploration of life among
the "other kind" is often wryly funny, and when they show up at the familiar
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX> diner to compare notes, time stops and we bask in their banter. If I
sound sour compared with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>, it's because I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levinson</ENAMEX> missed a
chance to get something unique and audacious on screen: the story of a
thin-skinned <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> who'd grow up to make autobiographical movies that
somehow leave out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewishness</ENAMEX> and then get so enraged by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX>'s offhand
projection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewishness</ENAMEX> into a big WASPy sci-fi picture that he vows to go
back and remake his other films with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> instead of gentiles. That would be
something to see.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> have been falling all over themselves to announce
that 
                  All About My 
                  Mother
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marks</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro Almodóvar</ENAMEX>'s arrival
as a mature, world-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>. Not to take anything away from his
movie--it's a lovely work--but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Almodóvar</ENAMEX> arrived as a world-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> 15
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, when his silly, campy, and impassioned melodramas were like joyous
dances on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>. His new work is his most sober, maybe because his
alter ego--an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-year-old</TIMEX> devoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, aspiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, and worshipper of
flamboyant actresses--gets run over by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> while chasing an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> (who'd
just played <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blanche DuBois</ENAMEX>) for her autograph. This shocking act of
self-effacement paves the way for a film suffused by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>'s loss. His
grief-stricken <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cecilia Roth</ENAMEX>) goes off in search of the father the boy
never met--now an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>-ridden transvestite in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX>--and ends up at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> of a benign matriarchal society that includes the very <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> (Marisa
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paredes</ENAMEX>) that her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> was pursuing.

            The film has been consciously devised as the flip
side of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">All About Eve</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>)--as a tale of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> not bitchily at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
another's throats but holding one another together through life's most
senseless tragedies. (The definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> here is broad enough to include
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transvestites</ENAMEX> and transsexuals.) Things that might once have been screamingly
campy are now played "straight": <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> dramatize their emotions but rarely
overdramatize them. And even though the film is full of laughs, the jokes hover
on the edge of the abyss: This is a world in which lurid colors and extravagant
gestures are means of filling the void.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almodóvar</ENAMEX>'s movies are
the transparent reveries of a gay, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>-struck adolescent. Most of us have
equivalent fantasies, but we'd be ashamed to expose ourselves by putting them
out there. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almodóvar</ENAMEX>--even here, in his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Sirk</ENAMEX> mode--gives them
the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX> that banishes embarrassment.

            I'm embarrassed to admit it, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce Brosnan</ENAMEX> is growing
on me. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ian Fleming</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Bond</ENAMEX> was a snob and a lightweight. It was only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sean</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connery</ENAMEX>'s peculiar combination of traits--he could seem rugged and snooty at
once--that made us think <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">007</NUMEX> a more interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> than he was. In

                  The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">World Is Not Enough</ENAMEX>
               , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brosnan</ENAMEX> brings the right Flemingesque
irritation to the opening chase. Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Moore</ENAMEX>, who seemed detached from
the action (as well as from his stunt double), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Dalton</ENAMEX>, who seemed
above it, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brosnan</ENAMEX> makes you believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond</ENAMEX>'s absurd feats are the plausible
upshot of his refusal to be bested by social or sexual inferiors. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> is
still sleek, but the touch of crepe paper around his face has eliminated the
plastic, department-store-mannequin look that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Remington Steele</ENAMEX> exploited
so shrewdly. He's vulnerable now: You don't want his sewn-on suit to get
wrinkled, because fine tailoring appears to be all this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> has. He even winces
in pain a couple of times, and in the climax lets out a grunt that takes the
Bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> (the dire <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denise Richards</ENAMEX>) aback.

            The movie is better than
you've heard, although that's not saying a lot. I confess I always want to like
the latest Bond flick. I have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pavlovian</ENAMEX> reaction to the pre-title
black-white-and-red bit with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monty Norman</ENAMEX>'s theme and the gun site roving over
the latest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">007</NUMEX> as he saunters to the center of the frame--I go, "Kill 'em,
Bond!"

            Much has been made of hiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Apted</ENAMEX> to bring a more
human touch to the series. There's only so much a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> can do with the most
ironclad formula in movies, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apted's</ENAMEX> documentary instincts give the eastern
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> locations more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality</ENAMEX>, and the dialogue scenes aren't as choppy
as usual: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brosnan</ENAMEX> and his co-stars actually get a rhythm going. There's even a
rare performance from one of the "Bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie Marceau</ENAMEX>, as a damsel in
distress who turns out to be very distressed--psychologically--by a
previous kidnapping attempt. Plus, she has a long, rounded chin that I find
mysteriously intoxicating.

            The filmmakers drop the ball, though, on their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master villain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Renard</ENAMEX>, who has a bullet in his brain that renders him
impervious to physical pain. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Carlyle</ENAMEX> is a wonderful (and frightening)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX>, but the movie pumps him up to be such a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terminator</ENAMEX>--"his only goal is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chaos</ENAMEX>, and he grows stronger <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> until he dies"--that when this little
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guy</ENAMEX> comes shambling on and turns out to be such a soulful twit, the movie loses
all its credibility. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apted</ENAMEX> might be too much of a humanist for a Bond picture.
It's not so bad that the blows aren't heavily amplified, but when the bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX>
get it there isn't that extra sadistic beat to let you know how surprised they
are that their aura of invincibility has been punctured. I kept thinking, "Kill
'em again, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX>!"
