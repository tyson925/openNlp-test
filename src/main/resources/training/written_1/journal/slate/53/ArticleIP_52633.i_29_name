                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and I regularly read your column and
just love it! Shameless flattery aside, we do have an issue and hope you can
help us. My brother-in-law is in a serious relationship with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine.
I actually introduced them at my wedding. The problem is that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> treats
my brother-in-law (and everyone else, for that matter) like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX>. She yells at
him, tells him what to do, what to wear, where to go, and how to spend his free
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. She is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moody</ENAMEX> and extremely unpleasant to everyone. Needless to say, I
don't see much of her anymore. Anyway, we are afraid that my poor
brother-in-law, who does not have the benefit of very much experience in
relationships, will ask her to marry him.
            

            
               My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> cannot stand her and dread having her at
family gatherings--to the point where we are all trying to figure out how not
to invite her to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>. In short, we want to say something
to him because we know that there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> out there who will treat him with
respect, courtesy, and affection. How can we tell him how we feel without
making him feel totally alienated?
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hopeful</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va.</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Hope</ENAMEX>,

            Perhaps your brother-in-law views being emotionally
slapped around as foreplay? The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> you describe sounds like a cross between
a harridan and a dominatrix. However, even an inexperienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> knows when he
is being treated like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> in obedience <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. Prudie wonders why he thinks
this is all right. The loose thread here is that you say you don't see much of
her anymore, but she was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>. Did her behavior change?

            In any case, since your
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brother-in-law</ENAMEX>'s nearest and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dearest</ENAMEX> want to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss Congeniality</ENAMEX> away from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">holiday</ENAMEX> gatherings, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> suggests you and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coterie</ENAMEX> of concerned friends
decide on a designated yenta (which is how it may be perceived) and that person
must tell him flat out that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who care about him do not like the way he is
being treated, and they see <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dark</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> ahead. He will either respond with a
defense of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMS</ENAMEX> poster <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>, or confess that he is trying to end the
relationship. Either way, he will be made aware of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>, which is really
all that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsiders</ENAMEX> can do. If he chooses to stay in the relationship and the
next gathering is a nightmare, simply tell him the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> makes for too much
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discomfort</ENAMEX> and, although you will miss his presence, the greater good of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> takes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">precedence</ENAMEX> and not to plan on further get-togethers. Worst case
scenario is that he will feel alienated, and his relationship with all
of you will be strained ... but just as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> don't let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> drive drunk,
neither do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> watch in silence as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> hook up with bitches.

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, directly

            
               
                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, who is a charming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> in almost
all other respects, appears to have a grave problem staying employed. There is
a definite pattern afoot here: At <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, the new job is wonderful, the people
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scintillating</ENAMEX> and fabulous, the work enticing and exciting. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</TIMEX>,
trouble begins to brew--invariably with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>. What follows is less a
slide down a slippery slope than a professional avalanche that results in
either a dismissal or a narrow escape to the next "dream job," where, of
course, the cycle repeats yet again.
            

            
               It is screamingly obvious to everyone who knows
and loves her that the trouble lies with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and not, as she would have
it, with the parade of horrible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bosses</ENAMEX> fate has saddled her with. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Needles</ENAMEX> to
say, as I write this letter, she is about to lose another job. She is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX>. I
have tried gently to suggest therapy. I've sympathized and logged <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> and
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> on the telephone listening to every sordid detail of every office slight,
all to no avail. I have even considered appealing to her current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> (with
whom I have a warm acquaintance) to overlook her nuttiness and keep her on
because, despite her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sturm und Drang</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> manner, she really is very
good at what she does.
            

            
               I admit a good deal
of my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> is self-motivated. With a modest income of my own and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to provide for, I fear if she loses this job, it will be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">her last</NUMEX>,
leaving me to support her--and I know in advance that I can't let her end up in
a welfare <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>. But her chances for finding a replacement gig dwindle with
every lost job and every looming birthday. I would prefer to be my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> than my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, but my resentment is building <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>.
Prudie, what to do?
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Distraught Daughter</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Dis</ENAMEX>,

            What a thoughtful, insightful letter. While at some
point all grown-up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> become, to a greater or lesser degree, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, your situation is complicated by, at best, a personality
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disorder</ENAMEX>, and at worst, mental illness. Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s repeated manic initial
response to a job, then making a mess of it, is legitimate cause for concern.
What you must do now is confront your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> with the truth as tactfully and
forcefully as possible. Make clear that you are willing to be emotionally
supportive if she makes efforts to help herself but that financially you are
unable to have her as a dependent.

            For your own emotional
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">well-being</ENAMEX>, know that the worst case scenario may involve distancing yourself
if she will not acknowledge her problem. If she winds up "in the system,"
getting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> or state supervised housing and therapy that may not be a bad
thing. This is sometimes the mental-health equivalent of an alcoholic hitting
bottom. You should also know that your evaluation of the situation is humane
and loving, and that, however things play out, you will have been a good and
caring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>.

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, supportively

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> may
disagree with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX>-fisted way in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> were evicted from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like me with sensitive noses appreciate the result. It took
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> for me to work up the courage to ask someone not to smoke near me, and
now I don't have to do that anymore. But a new terror has arisen. Recently, in
a crowded but fancy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> in the middle of the delicious main course, the
empty table next to ours was occupied by a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> including a woman
wearing far too much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">perfume</ENAMEX>. It was overwhelming and made it literally
impossible to taste the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>: Everything tasted like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">perfume</ENAMEX>. And then my nose
started to run. The expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> was ruined, but I didn't say a word. Should
I have? And to whom?
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allergic</ENAMEX> and Sniffly
            

            Dear All,

            In the particular situation you write about, you
could have asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maitre d'</ENAMEX> to give you another table, assuming one was
available. In the big picture, however, overpowering scents are a burgeoning
problem, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> shares your discomfort. Since there is no way to instruct a
strange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> to please hightail it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and wash off all that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chanel No. 5</ENAMEX> or to inform <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that the scent they have chosen to pour all
over themselves is retch-inducing, those of us who are knocked out by perfume
are basically stuck. Moving one's location or leaving an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> is about
as far as an offended <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> can go. Some places, however, have designated
themselves "scent-free zones," but certainly a small number. This may be the
wave of the future, however, because who would have thought, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years ago</TIMEX>, that
you couldn't light up in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> problem with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perfumes</ENAMEX> and colognes is that the wearer, for some strange reason, is not able
to smell when she or he has overdone it. And, surprise, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> can be as guilty as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Also some ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> tend to go in for excessive eau de whatever,
sometimes instead of bathing. And of course there are the tchotchke <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> in
which one is overcome by potpourri, incense, scented candles, and sachet. Being
assaulted by smells unfortunately is an issue we can often do little about.
Maybe nose plugs?

                  Prudie,
               
            

            
               Regarding the letter
from "," I can tell you from experience that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> do not take kindly to ANY
advice given them about raising their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Sitting down and having a frank
discussion is asking to start <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War III</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Better your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX> should be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> can go to for advice, support,
kind words, etc. Better she should do everything in her power to be a role
model of acceptance and love and build up these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>' self-esteem at every
opportunity. If they spend time alone with her, so much the better. As for her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>, mm could express her understanding of how difficult it must be to raise
these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, give her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> a chance to vent, mention classes or books that
might be helpful, but never, never make it personal. No finger-pointing or
superior attitudes, please. It never has a happy ending.
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Four Sisters of My Own</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Four</ENAMEX>,

            Thank you for adding
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immeasurably</ENAMEX> to the discussion. You have firsthand knowledge of a situation
which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>, as an only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, could not have ... proving, again, that
experience has great value.
