            In his raucous,
vaudevillian allegory 
                  Dogma
               , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Smith</ENAMEX> concocts a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">scenario</ENAMEX> in
which the will of God comes apocalyptically into conflict with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic</ENAMEX>
doctrine. To wholly relate how that happens--the plot involves a missionary New
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jersey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Carlin</ENAMEX>), the devil, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fallen, somewhat insane
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">angels</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Damon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Affleck</ENAMEX>)--would not only ruin the surprise, it would
ruin this review, since there are nearly as many convolutions in the narrative
as there are in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scripture</ENAMEX>. I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> wrote about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dogma</ENAMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s edgy
press conference) when the movie had its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> premiere in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Film Festival</ENAMEX> amid demonstrations by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic League</ENAMEX> and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Click to read that account. Then I'll tell you a few things that I wish
I'd said, regret saying, and might have said better.

            Some additional hosannas
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. The angels' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wings</ENAMEX> are cool. They look like genuine flesh, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cartilage</ENAMEX>, especially when they're clipped, and they literally add texture to
effects that might have seemed, well, featherweight. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dogma</ENAMEX> is the first
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>--whose clunky direction in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chasing Amy</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>) did his
skillful script no favors--seems interested in moving the camera, composing the
frame, editing, etc. The mixture of slacker small-talk, goofy slapstick, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Guignol</ENAMEX> horror works better than anyone could have imagined. What holds
it all together is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer-director</ENAMEX>'s fervid conviction. A hint of cynicism
would have turned <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dogma</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>, but the movie--in spite of its rubber
poop monsters and splattery gore and smutty jokes--has the resonance of
belief.

            On reflection, however, I think that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> was being a tad
disingenuous when he said at his press conference that he wasn't expecting an
angry reaction. Yes, he's a good <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>, but he's also schooled in the
works of that very bad <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Waters</ENAMEX>. Yes, he wanted to affirm his
reverence for God and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>, but he also wanted to give a hot<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-foot</NUMEX> to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Church</ENAMEX>. Like a lot of good comics, he wanted to be "outrageous"--but
he didn't necessarily want to outrage . He was truly shocked when
homicidally <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Semitic</ENAMEX> letters poured into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bob</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinstein</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miramax</ENAMEX>. (Its parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX>, ultimately decided not to
distribute the film.) And he's legitimately terrified of death threats--who
wouldn't be? He wanted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to talk--and laugh and argue--about his movie,
but he had no intention of courting martyrdom.

            Let's go further and admit that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> is not merely
"kicking the tires of his faith"--he's slashing them. He's saying that
organized religion needs a better tread. He's blaming the indifferent status of
a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholics</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> itself. (His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">churchgoing heroine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bethany</ENAMEX>,
played by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Fiorentino</ENAMEX>, has become so desensitized to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican</ENAMEX> teachings
that she works in an abortion clinic.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> has written a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>--the
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13 th apostle</NUMEX>, played by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chris Rock</ENAMEX>--whose view of organized religion
is akin to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Ventura</ENAMEX>'s: He believes it has lost touch with the
fundamental religious impulse. In the film, there is no counterweight to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rock</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apostle</ENAMEX>--no substantial or sane <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> who speaks on the rightness of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> dogma. There isn't even a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dostoevskian Grand Inquisitor</ENAMEX> to tell us why
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> need so many rules and regulations to keep from following their animal
natures into despair and anarchy. The tone of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dogma</ENAMEX> might be searching,
but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> already has his answers. Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Scorsese</ENAMEX>, whose solemn <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>
adaptation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikos Kazantzakis</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Last Temptation of</ENAMEX> 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Christ</ENAMEX>
set off a similar firestorm, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> has earned the wrath. He should just say: "I
meant to piss you off, just don't start any pogroms or shoot me."

            There's another aspect of
Dogma that rattles peoples' cages. Most millennial apocalypse fantasies
have been promulgated by the religious right, which wants to frighten people
into repenting their liberal attitudes toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scripture</ENAMEX>. Outside of weird
fringe pictures such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Cohen</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">God Told Me To</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>),
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dogma</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> truly countercultural apocalypse fantasy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> is
fighting the end-of-the-world <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mavens</ENAMEX> on their own turf, appropriating their
rhetoric and their symbols for his own, decidedly less <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Moral Majoritarian ends</ENAMEX>.
You can imagine the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doomsayers</ENAMEX> storming out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> and fuming, "Whose
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armageddon</ENAMEX> is it, anyway<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>"

            The camera is at eye level for 
                  Rosetta
               . In
the tumultuous opening, it hurtles down a staircase behind the teen-age title
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emilie Dequenne</ENAMEX>) as she tries to elude the factory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> who has just
fired her. It swerves left then right as she pulls on locked doors in a vain
attempt to evade the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>'s security. It's sickeningly in the thick of things
as she claws at her pursuers and shrieks that it's unfair, she's a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>,
she doesn't deserve to be let go. Throughout this terse, entertaining parable
(it won the grand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prize</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cannes Film Festival</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Belgian</ENAMEX>-born
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">writer-directors Luc</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Pierre Dardenne</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Promesse</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>)
immerse you in the sensations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosetta</ENAMEX>'s life: her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>, roundabout slog
through the woods to reach the trailer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> where she lives with her alcoholic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX> (she's too ashamed to go through the front entrance); her frustrating
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">treks</ENAMEX> to find employment, however menial; and, most of all, her countless rages
at a society that refuses to grant her a "normal" (her word) existence.

            By confining the movie's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosetta</ENAMEX> and her rituals, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dardennes</ENAMEX> suggest the ways in which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> lose the big picture and so have no insight into their own corruption.
All they know is what they need--and what will happen if someone else beats
them out. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dequenne</ENAMEX>, the filmmakers have found a somewhat lumpen girl
with just a trace of prettiness, especially when she opens her eyes and lets
the world see in. She mostly doesn't, though, which is the point. She tromps
around dull-eyed in a gray skirt and thick, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mustard</ENAMEX>-colored stockings--a sullen
bottom-feeder. When a generous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riquet</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fabrizio Rongione</ENAMEX>)--the only one
she has ever had, the film implies--falls into quicksand and screams for help,
you can see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosetta</ENAMEX>'s thought processes: If he dies, his job will open up,
she'll get it, and she'll be "normal."

            As in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Promesse</ENAMEX> , the point is to show how
capitalism is fundamentally at odds with human decency. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are good, but
they're driven to victimize others by the fear that what they have will be
taken away. At best, they turn into machines; at worst (most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bosses</ENAMEX>),
they become casual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exploiters</ENAMEX>. You can't land a job without being raked by the
angry gaze of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> you've unfairly replaced, and once you have it there
are no guarantees that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> you won't be raking someone else with your own
angry gaze. Change the way things work and you will change <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX>, is the
implicit message--although it's crucial to add that there are no
explicit messages, no Brechtian/<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Marxist</ENAMEX> exhortations. Both
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosetta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Promesse</ENAMEX> end at the point when their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protagonist</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">consciousness</ENAMEX> begins. The next step is anyone's guess.

            I fear I've made
Rosetta sound programmatic. Well, it is, but the thing you come away
with isn't the program but the rhythm and texture of a young, working-class
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">woman</ENAMEX>'s life. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dardennes</ENAMEX> are peerless at staging and shooting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rituals</ENAMEX>, such
as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosetta</ENAMEX>'s day selling waffles and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> from a truck: taking an order,
plucking a waffle from the iron, grabbing a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> from the shelf, counting
money, making change, saying thank you, taking another order … It's easy to
dismiss films that make grandiose statements about how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ought to live but
never convincingly portray how they do. The utterly believable capitalist
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ecosystems of the Dardennes</ENAMEX> are harder to shake off.

            Most of the good stuff in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Trevor</ENAMEX>'s novel

                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Felicia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Journey</ENAMEX>
                takes place behind the eyes of its central
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>: a young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Felicia</ENAMEX>, who crosses the sea to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> in a
hopeful quest to find the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of her unborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>; and the fat, middle-aged
catering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiditch</ENAMEX>, who takes a paternal interest in the lass when it
becomes clear that her young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> has caddishly given her the slip. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> is
a naive, but her mixture of optimism and spooky prescience gives her
perceptions weight, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hiditch</ENAMEX> has a subterranean existence that's constantly
at odds with his pleasantries: He might well be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychopath</ENAMEX> who has preyed
on--and dispatched--other young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atom Egoyan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> director
( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exotica</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>; The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Sweet Hereafter</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>) who adapted and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> the book, does tender, morbidly evocative work. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felicia</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coltish Elaine Cassidy</ENAMEX> manages to look both luminous and unformed, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bob</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoskins</ENAMEX> gives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hiditch</ENAMEX>'s bland homilies so much subtext he made me think of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Opera House</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Phantom of the Opera</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> under basement
under basement down to the dungeons. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Handing Felicia</ENAMEX> a cup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>, he says,
"The goodness is in the warmth, they say," and I half expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">maggots</ENAMEX> to swarm
out of his mouth.

            The movie doesn't come to much, though. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egoyan</ENAMEX>'s
best films have tricky textures: They double and triple back on themselves in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> that play against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>' bland visages and the often sterile
settings. Here, apart from a few choice flashbacks, the action is crawlingly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX>--and opaque. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egoyan</ENAMEX> has invented a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">delicious character</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hiditch</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">celebrity French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chef mom</ENAMEX>--for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, the marvelous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arsinée Khanjian</ENAMEX>, and
she gives the movie a jolt of energy whenever she pops up on TV screens or in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hiditch</ENAMEX>'s memory. But the rest is just a cat-and-mouse game for a rather
slow-witted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> and an even slower-witted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quaaludes</ENAMEX>. Under water
