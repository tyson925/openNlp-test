               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            Many responses raged
against aviation--the cramped seats, the awful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, the plummeting. When air
disasters occur, there is an investigation to determine the cause, much as, at
the end of a relationship, we try to understand why it failed, but without the
advantage of voice recording, so we're left to squabble endlessly over who said
what. There is a theory that this search for a cause is an essentially
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superstitious</ENAMEX> act, an almost mystical hope that to name the cause is to ensure
that disaster won't recur. But in anything as complicated as aviation or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">romance</ENAMEX>, there are infinite possibilities for debacle. That's why there is much
to be said for rail travel. Not even the most depressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> can steer a
locomotive off the rails. You can get on and off right in the middle of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, avoiding the hassles of that trip to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>. Railroads provide the
happy erotic metaphor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> going into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX>; air travel offers the
grim symbolism of "crash and burn." On a train you're not trapped in your seat;
you can stroll the aisles or amble to the bar <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and meet an attractive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX> with whom to initiate what is certain to be a disastrous relationship.
Just like the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tawakilt ala Allah</ENAMEX>.
            

            Heard on the cockpit voice recorder of EgyptAir
Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">990</NUMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> sentence--in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, "I put my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> in God"--was
uttered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gamil al-Batouti</ENAMEX>, the relief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-pilot</ENAMEX>, just before the autopilot was
shut off and the flaps adjusted to send the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> into a dive.

            It might be a prayer before dying, as Batouti
deliberately plunged the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> into the sea. And then again, it might be just
an ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> of speech, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> "Oh my God" or the New York
"Fuck you"--said many times during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> with no real theological or erotic
significance.

            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Cornell</ENAMEX>, an associate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of religion at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke University</ENAMEX>, "It's typically used to initiate
something, if you're embarking on a situation where you don't know the
outcome."

            "I say it as soon as I
get into my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to pick my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> up from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hala Arafa</ENAMEX>, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voice of America</ENAMEX>. "I also say it when I start cooking in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> and when I arrive at work and start my assignments."
