                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
       
               I would appreciate your views about an experience I had recently. I
was at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarket</ENAMEX> buying bulk <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candy</ENAMEX> (a confection called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Hokey Pokey</ENAMEX>").
It's in a bin, you scoop it into a bag, write the bin number on the twist-tie,
and pay for it by the pound at the checkout. As I was writing the bin number on
the tie, I noticed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> politely waiting for me to finish. I moved out of
the way, then she--I know you see this coming--scooped up a handful of Hokey
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pokey</ENAMEX> and popped it in her mouth. I didn't say or do anything, and now I wish I
had.
            

            
               It's irritating
enough that I and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> have to cover the cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">in-store snacks</ENAMEX> for
her and others. But I have recently become a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> and wonder how I should
react to this type of situation if I were with an inquisitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. Do you
think I should have said something to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>? Should I have told the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>? I'm interested in your opinion.
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Paul</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minn.</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear R.</ENAMEX>,

            This is one of those public issues where the act
seems minor, but the collective price is significant. It is of course, as you
perceived, an ethical lapse. As for the questions you raise, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> thinks you
were correct not to say anything because that would have undoubtedly led to a
brouhaha in the aisle--perhaps with some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hokey Pokey</ENAMEX> being lobbed. It would
also have seemed petty to go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> and tattle--mostly because he would
probably have been disinclined to approach her and say, "I was informed you've
been eating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hokey Pokey</ENAMEX>." Arrests at candy bins are probably rare.

            Had Prudie been there,
in lieu of saying anything, she might have made eye contact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> and
then raised an eyebrow, the message being "My dear, what behavior!" If your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> was old enough to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> the candy bin caper and wondered why the woman
was eating from the bin, you would have been perfectly within the bounds of
propriety to say, "You are quite right. What the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> is doing is dishonest,
but we are not in charge of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>." If the transgressor were to hear
this, you'd be in the clear because you would not have been talking to her ...
and she would be just as embarrassed as if you had been. In sum, what you
witnessed was petty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thievery</ENAMEX>, not someone poisoning the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> water supply, and
no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> was being harmed. You did the correct thing by not trying to be a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX>. The key to the question: To intervene or not to intervene, is
judgment. That's what it's all about.

                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               I have a situation.
I have a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of the opposite sex who I've known for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX>.
Although he was initially attracted to me, the feeling wasn't mutual, so we
became platonic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>. He even got married recently. The thing is, we've
become closer--and now I'm attracted to him. We haven't had sex, but a frolic
or two has occurred. Since I've never thought of myself as "the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>"
type, we are not hanging out again until this goes away. His friendship is
important to me, and I take those duties seriously. Do you think we can go back
to being really good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> sans frolic? Or does my wish to be a good friend
require severing the relationship? Help!!!!
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Where the Hell Did This Come From</ENAMEX>?
            

            Dear Where,

            It is quite likely that
you are suffering from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Grass-Is-Greener Syndrome</ENAMEX>. And, oh, to know what a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frolic</ENAMEX> is! The image it suggests to your steadfast <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> is of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
dancing in a meadow ... though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> knows this can't be what you mean. And
when you say the friendship is on hold "until this goes away," what, exactly,
is "this"? The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>? The marriage? The attraction? Perhaps what needs to go
away is you; that is, put the kibosh on the get-togethers. The electricity is
not going to diminish, because most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> like to ... frolic. If you are sincere
about being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, you will save him from himself by keeping your distance.
Not entirely unmarried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are seldom worth the trouble.

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, definitively

            
               
                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               Having read many cases in which you handled
tricky situations very adeptly, I am hoping you can help me do the same with
mine. I have known a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years now</TIMEX> (we are both graduate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> within a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>), and we've always gotten along very well.
However, I have noticed that there is a great turnover in her circle of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> inevitably get dropped. To compensate, she always seems to
turn to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> (usually new arrivals in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>) about whom she is
wild for a while, until the ardor cools. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have noticed that she
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pursues people</ENAMEX> to add to her collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, and she takes great pride
in bragging about all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> she knows. She is intelligent, attractive, and
friendly, but it seems to me she turns on the extroversion to hide
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insecurity</ENAMEX>.
            

            
               Having been her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and watched this happen again and again, I had thought I was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX>. But alas, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last months</TIMEX> I seem to have been increasingly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blacklisted</ENAMEX>. She still refers to me as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, but I feel I am treated quite
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coldly</ENAMEX> now. I hate to see this hurtful pattern continue. Prudie, work your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">magic</ENAMEX>!
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Newest Odd Man Out</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Dear New,</ENAMEX>

            OK, abracadabra: Clap
your hands together <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times and say, "All right, I'm out of this game." The
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>" sounds like the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> we used to call "a user" in junior
high, or "a narcissist" in grown-up psychological circles. At best, this
soi-disant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen bee</ENAMEX> is fickle, so what is there about the friendship
that is of value? Since it's easier to change one's own behavior than that of
another, you might want to consider why this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is important to you. There
is perhaps an element of your having felt like the chosen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>--someone so
marvelous that even a notoriously picky <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> could not discard you. This is
not what friendship is about. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> is sympathetic, however, because
narcissistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are often attractive. The problem is that they're not worth
it.

                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               My dilemma has to do
with one-upmanship. A close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX>, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>, has a terrible
habit of having "the worst case the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> ever saw," or "the worst (whatever)
the mechanic ever dealt with." No matter what difficulties anyone else present
has, hers are always worse. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> get-togethers seem more like a meeting
of pathologists, each trying to dredge up more horrific experiences. How can I
keep this from happening at our upcoming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> reunion? (I am hosting it.) I
am aware that this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> is very emotionally <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">needy</ENAMEX>, but it's all getting to be
too much.
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.D.</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear B.</ENAMEX>,

            Where is your sense of
humor? The battle of the calamities is really kind of funny--and if you're onto
it, so must everyone else be. Actually, it sounds like a nice change from the
more common, "My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologist</ENAMEX> is the best in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>." Those who truck in
superlatives are recognized by thinking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loose talkers</ENAMEX> and are not
taken very seriously. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> doesn't see what the harm is, and perhaps some
light joshing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Auntie</ENAMEX>'s direction--since she seems to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> on everyone
else--might advance your goal of diminishing the family game of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Can You Top</ENAMEX>
This?"
