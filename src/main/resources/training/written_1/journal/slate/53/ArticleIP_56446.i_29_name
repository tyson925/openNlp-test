<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo University of Agriculture</ENAMEX> have drawn the ire of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> for their aggressive cloning experiments. The team
transplanted the nuclei of human white blood cells into the egg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cows</ENAMEX>
and applied electric shocks to fuse them. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> began segmenting but
stopped after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>. Had the cells continued segmenting, as normal cells
do, they could have (theoretically) been implanted into a human uterus and
potentially produced a human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clone</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan Economic Newswire</ENAMEX> reports that
the experiment may have violated a government policy that forbids university
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ministry</ENAMEX>-related research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> from creating human clones and
transplanting nuclei into human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg cells</ENAMEX>.

            "Organ
Watch" has been formed to monitor what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UC Berkeley</ENAMEX> anthropologist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy</ENAMEX>
Scheper-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> calls "modern cannibalism"--the theft of body parts from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corpses</ENAMEX>--which occurs predominantly in impoverished <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> around the globe.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia University</ENAMEX> will investigate the global
distribution of human organs and look into urban legends, such as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in
which a drugged party-goer wakes up in a bath of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice water</ENAMEX> with his kidneys
extracted. Next to them is a phone and a note that says, "Call <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> immediately
or you will die."

Letters sent to the imprisoned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Kaczynski</ENAMEX>--from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">admirers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foes</ENAMEX> alike--are
bound for the anarchist papers collection at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Michigan</ENAMEX>.
Photocopies of letters and other writings by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unabomber</ENAMEX> himself will also
join the archive (all slightly abridged for the protection of privacy, that
is). A university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesperson</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan Daily</ENAMEX> that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> is also interested in acquiring evidence from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaczynski</ENAMEX>'s trial but
that it won't be available until after he "has exhausted his appeals
options."

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hillsdale College</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Roche III</ENAMEX>, nationally known for decrying a moral crisis in
higher education, resigned from his <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$188,000</NUMEX> post. According to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chronicle of Higher Education</ENAMEX> , the precipitating event was the suicide
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche</ENAMEX>'s daughter-in-law amid rumors of an affair between her and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche</ENAMEX>.
After resigning, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche</ENAMEX> only said, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chronicle</ENAMEX> , "I am
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly 65 years of age</TIMEX> and have no wish to continue." Hillsdale, located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 miles</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX>, held an all-school convocation to discuss the future
direction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX>.

            The
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last time</TIMEX> Goddard
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College</ENAMEX> went shopping for a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, its advertising copy quipped,
"We need someone who is prepared to lead us through a process that questions
the necessity of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place." Questioning the necessity of
the current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> is the newly unionized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX>, which recently filed a
vote of "no confidence" in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara C. Mossberg</ENAMEX> over her management
style. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goddard's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trustees</ENAMEX> dismissed the faculty wrath
as "labor negotiations tactics" and described the call for a new president
consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goddard College</ENAMEX> tradition: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> has had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX> in
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last decade</TIMEX>.

University <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> cleaned off their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">porches</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last February</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>, city council outlawed the use of indoor furniture out-of-doors. But
today, the couches are back. Led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OU</ENAMEX> neurobiology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Hooper</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> beat back the law with a referendum that won by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>-vote margin
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,506</NUMEX> in favor, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,460</NUMEX> against). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OU</ENAMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer Ciganko</ENAMEX> saluted the return
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> decorating tradition. "My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> went here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years ago</TIMEX> and there
were couches on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">porches</ENAMEX>," she said.

the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX>, will take the reins at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>. (Current
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Floyd S. Bloom</ENAMEX> will return to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scripps Research Institute</ENAMEX>.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>
resigned from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> after reports circulated that he had acquired
extravagant personal items at the expense of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.

            The
government wants to bust the drug policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Health</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Services</ENAMEX> awarded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John Jay College of Criminal Justice</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.6</NUMEX>
million grant in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> to support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ansley Hamid</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year</TIMEX> study of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX> use in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>'s toughest neighborhoods. But a federal complaint,
filed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late October</TIMEX>, accused the much-celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamid</ENAMEX> of misappropriating
grant funds for personal use--to take trips, buy CDs, and work on an unrelated
book manuscript--and to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX> for his research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamid</ENAMEX> faces <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250,000</NUMEX> fine, and losing his job, all over what he calls
"really trumped-up charges." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joy Settembrino</ENAMEX>, who refused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamid</ENAMEX>'s requests to
purchase items unrelated to the research, says of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamid</ENAMEX>: "It almost seemed that
he acted as if the check for the full <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.6 million</NUMEX> was written out to him to do
as he pleased."

            The
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">100 best</TIMEX> spiritual books of the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100 years</TIMEX> were
announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>. Compiled for the new<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">-agey</ENAMEX> publisher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harper San Francisco</ENAMEX>
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith College</ENAMEX> religion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Zaleski</ENAMEX>, the list includes books
from all major religious traditions as well as novels, essay collections,
letters, and confessions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm X</ENAMEX>, Mother <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Teresa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franz Kafka</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jack</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerouac</ENAMEX> made the cut. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Teilhard de Chardin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Phenomenon of Man</ENAMEX>
received the most votes from the nominating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zaleski</ENAMEX> thought people
might be surprised that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Lord of the Rings</ENAMEX> made the list. "I do think
it's the quintessential tale of good and evil, a deeply moral tale. And that
seems to be a spiritual subject," he told the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dallas Morning News</ENAMEX> .

understand the concepts and theories underlying their number crunching. "I want
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to think--and that's not what we get out of our math programs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>,"
