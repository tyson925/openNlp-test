               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> approved a final budget bill. The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$385 billion</NUMEX>
compromise measure, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has agreed to sign, passed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">296</NUMEX>-135.
It faces opposition in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> because of changes to dairy protections and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">satellite TV</ENAMEX> regulations. In the final deal, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> gained: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) additional
funding for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) environmental protections; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) money for
international relief and foreign relations. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> won: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.38</NUMEX>
percent across-the-board budget cut; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) increased spending on defense and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">veterans</ENAMEX>' health; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) the ability to claim to have protected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
Security surplus. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Optimists</ENAMEX> hailed it as a restrained and responsible measure that "limits spending in a booming economy ." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Skeptics</ENAMEX> called it a
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork-ridden sham</ENAMEX> , based on bookkeeping gimmicks.

            

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> remains in charge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EgyptAir</ENAMEX> Flight 990
investigation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> had planned to relinquish the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> for a criminal investigation into whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-pilot</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gamil al-Batouti</ENAMEX>
intentionally downed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> requested more
time to analyze the flight data and cockpit voice recordings. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Batouti</ENAMEX> is
suspected because: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) he uttered a prayer immediately before disengaging the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autopilot</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) his controls were in the "nose down" position, while the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">captain's</ENAMEX> were in "nose up"; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> pleaded with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Batouti</ENAMEX> to help
him pull the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> out of its dive. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> spin: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX> are
"rushing to judgment" based on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Muslim</ENAMEX> bias. The American spin: There's
no evidence of any other cause.

            

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> raised short-term interest rates. The
quarter-point boost, to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.5 percent</NUMEX>, was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> increase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> in the
rate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> charge each other on loans. Despite evidence of slowing growth, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> said the move was necessary to prevent future inflation as unemployment
declines. Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> debated whether the announcement was: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
bad news, since it curtails business growth; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) good news, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>
signaled that this would be the last increase of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>; or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3</NUMEX>) a non-event,
since the move was widely anticipated. (

               A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> was found guilty of murder.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathaniel Abraham</ENAMEX>, who was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> at the time of the crime, is believed to be the
youngest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> ever convicted of murder as a non-juvenile offense. He could
face life in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> will likely ask that he be detained in a
juvenile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> until his sentence is reassessed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 21</TIMEX>. Juvenile justice
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> said the case revealed the inhumanity of trying ever younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>, who have fought for stricter punishment of
juveniles, hailed it as a victory for justice and safety.

            

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> tentatively compromised on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> debts and
abortion restrictions. Congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> agreed to approve
nearly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 billion</NUMEX> in back payments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>. In return, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> agreed to prohibit government-funded relief
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> from performing abortions or promoting abortion rights. If
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> waives the ban, funding for overseas family planning will be decreased
by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 percent</NUMEX>. Abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> from both sides called the deal the biggest
anti-abortion
victory since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> took office. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> termed it a
huge win for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>, "who walked away with a disturbingly large
share of what they wanted." But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concessions</ENAMEX> were
"largely
symbolic" and would "not interfere with family planning programs around the
world."

            

               A federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> suspended <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> restrictions on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX> fees.
