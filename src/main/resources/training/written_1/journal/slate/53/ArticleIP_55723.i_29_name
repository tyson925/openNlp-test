            Forget
retailing. On the Net, the next hot online business is politics. Consider: On
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voter</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, a site that launched
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> can fill out e-questionnaires and search for the candidates
with whom they most often agree. On <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Politics</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, another new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> can plug in their ZIP
codes to search <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Election Commission</ENAMEX> filings to see who their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>
donated to. On Vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, a site
run by ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Morris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> can answer a poll and have
e-mails stating their positions automatically shipped to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX>.

            On the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eve</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> presidential election, the world of politics has shown it can
embrace the Internet by offering a slew of for-profit Web sites. These and
other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are arming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> with tools that they have never had before to
find information and express views. As a host of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> chase the
Internet gravy train, the question is whether politics can form the basis of a
real <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. Can a political Web site go public and raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions</NUMEX>?

            "It's
not like selling books on the Internet," concedes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Anderson</ENAMEX>, a partner
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skywood Ventures</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sand Hill Road VC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> that is funding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voter</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com,</ENAMEX>
which proposes to make revenue via personalization and advertising. "This is
new and different and no one has done this before. ... We believe that lots of
other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have made a business out of providing these messages and providing
the medium. We don't see any reason why it won't be the same for the
Internet."

            
Already, there are political content sites sponsored by major news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>,
such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OnPolitics</ENAMEX> feature, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can
search for information via their ZIP code. There are party sites. And there are
nonprofit sites that have made names for themselves by providing quality
political information. One such site is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democracy Network</ENAMEX>, which won a
recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEC</ENAMEX> ruling lifting the ban on nonprofits hosting online candidate
debates. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are experimenting with technology, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FreedomChannel</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, which
provides video-on-demand of the presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, broken down by
issue.

            "We
thought at a time when you're introducing a new technology, it is probably wise
to do so in a way that encourages public trust rather than public distrust,"
says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FreedomChannel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Bailey</ENAMEX>. "For-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> face the same hurdle
as any other site on the Internet: What is the motive behind the people
providing the information? That begs the next question: What do they do with
the information I give them? What's their agenda?"

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Politics</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, a general-interest political content site,
says that since politics is already a huge business in the physical world,
there's no reason it shouldn't be in the online world. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> model for
Politics.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX> involves selling ads. "It's the older, more educated, more
affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who vote, and they also have higher Internet use," notes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobson</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prodigy exec</ENAMEX>. "I think that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> and computer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> are all going to want to speak to this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>."

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voter</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, a site that uses personalization features to put <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in touch
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, is also seeking ad revenues. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> contends that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> and campaigns will be a source of this advertising, once the site
starts to build traffic. "There's been a constant argument on the Web since the
beginning. There's always been a push to do things for free for the good of the
world," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Justin Dangel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voter</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX>, who has every hope
of going IPO someday. "To pay for the resources to create a first-class
political Web site," including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, technology and marketing, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voter</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> had
to be for-profit, he adds.

            Some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> are skeptical about the business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> being proposed by the new
political sites. "There is no money to be made billing for sending messages to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Cornfield</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Washington</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX>, who paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250,000</NUMEX> for the Vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX> domain name, believes his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> will
help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> express their views to elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>. But the site has been
criticized by the likes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rush Limbaugh</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> for "spamming" the
government.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Snaps Morris</ENAMEX>: "Anybody who
thinks that getting a communication from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter</ENAMEX> in your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">district</ENAMEX> is spam--that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guy</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX>. Roast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> unless he changes his point of view."
