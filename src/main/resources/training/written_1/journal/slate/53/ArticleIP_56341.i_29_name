<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Yeltsin</ENAMEX>'s walk-out from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> security summit in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX> to protest against Western criticisms of the war in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chechnya</ENAMEX> provoked
some gloomy comment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> press <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Die Welt</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>'s front-page
lead lamented, "No hope for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechens</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian of London</ENAMEX> said
in an editorial that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s allowing a "token" visit by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization for Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooperation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> (OSCE) to the embattled
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">republic</ENAMEX> "will do nothing to halt the gut-wrenching mayhem in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chechnya</ENAMEX>, where
there remains no prospect of a ceasefire or even of a de-escalation." Noting
that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> support the war waged by "hawkish" <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Russian Prime</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir Putin</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> warned there are real signs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> is
breaking away "from the fickle embrace of western economic and political
neo-liberalism."

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Men</ENAMEX>
like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX>, harnessing nationalism, fear and prejudice, seem to promise a
stronger, prouder, better future," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian</ENAMEX> added. "It is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chechens</ENAMEX> who are presently paying with their blood for this illusion. But if
the trend intensifies, post-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX>, we may all pay for it." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Independent of London</ENAMEX>
took a hard editorial line. Saying that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kremlin</ENAMEX>'s attitude toward human
rights has scarcely changed since the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonid Brezhnev</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> said
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> should be threatened with expulsion from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSCE</ENAMEX> if it doesn't pull
back from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chechnya</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Repubblica of Rome</ENAMEX> reported <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s acceptance of
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSCE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> under the headline: "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> yields on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX>." In
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> itself, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">daily</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nezavisimaya Gazeta</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kremlin</ENAMEX> would only
start peace talks after the military campaign has reached its "logical
conclusion," but that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> will be at a loss about whom to conduct them
with, having branded the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX>'s present <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> as bandits and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>.

            
Leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belfast</ENAMEX> after presiding over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11-week</TIMEX> negotiations to rescue the
historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern Ireland</ENAMEX> peace agreement that he brokered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, former
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> received a lavish tribute from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times of London</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX> wrote: "To a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">naysayers</ENAMEX>,
he brought proverbial <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> can-do spirit. Into a cauldron of recrimination
and hatred he injected reason and calm. He was studiously neutral, utterly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unflappable</ENAMEX> and unfailingly optimistic as bombs, killings and expulsions
threatened to derail the peace process. Nobody else could have done what he
has." In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish Times</ENAMEX> quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> as saying that sharing meals had
been the key to the new rapprochement between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic republicans</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Protestant Unionists</ENAMEX>. The talks were "very tough" until the venue moved to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, he said. "We sat in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX>'s
living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. We shared meals together. â€¦ I insisted that there not be any
discussion of issues at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX>, that we just talk about other things so that
they could come to view each other not as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adversaries</ENAMEX> but as human beings and
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living in the same place and the same society and wanting the same
thing."

            As the
new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military regime</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> began court proceedings against the ousted
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nawaz Sharif</ENAMEX> on corruption and kidnapping charges--he is accused
of refusing to let the military coup <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plotters</ENAMEX> land as their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> was running
out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times of India</ENAMEX> ran an editorial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> saying that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pervaiz Musharraf</ENAMEX> (yes, that's his name, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>) has "wiped out the last
vestiges of democracy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>." It said that his crackdown on corruption
has put out of action not only <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sharif</ENAMEX> and former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benazir Bhutto</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main political movements, but also "almost the
entire <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> upper crust." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Musharraf</ENAMEX> "has acted in a manner which suggests
that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> may undergo a quiet political decapitation," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> said. It
also reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress Party</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonia Gandhi</ENAMEX> has
asked her <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> to commute a death sentence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> people
convicted of assassinating her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rajiv Gandhi</ENAMEX>,
because she was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. The convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, identified
only as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nalini</ENAMEX>, was the "back-up human bomb" who stood ready to kill herself
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> if the first suicide <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomber</ENAMEX> failed.

            For
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ha'aretz</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
refuses to take another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> off its list of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> that
support terrorism. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> with
which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> is poised to embark on peace talks. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerusalem Post</ENAMEX> ran an editorial speculating about
the significance for relations between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Jewry</ENAMEX> of the
decision taken in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> to merge <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> into
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Jewish Communities</ENAMEX>. Without offering an answer, it said that
both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American Jews</ENAMEX> face identity problems, though of different
kinds. "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> have been temporarily spared the brunt of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Jewish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assimilation</ENAMEX> crisis, because secular <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> remain <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>," it said. "Yet
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> faces an assimilation crisis of its own, that of how to maintain an
identity within the increasingly inviting outside world."

            Overriding all other
stories in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> was the news that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cherie Blair</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prime</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair</ENAMEX>, is expecting her <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> next <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> at the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>.
This will be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> born to a serving <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> in over
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">150 years</TIMEX>.
