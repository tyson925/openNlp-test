            Now
that the bustle of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holiday season</TIMEX> is officially underway, it appears that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tabloidland</ENAMEX> have been getting ... busy, if you know what we
mean. There's been a serious explosion of ardor in the pages of the tabs, with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> of all stripes doing their very best <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bunny rabbit imitations</ENAMEX>.

            
Tabloid staple <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celine Dion</ENAMEX>, for one, "plans to make love like there's no
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>," according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Enquirer</ENAMEX> . With her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband-manager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rene Angelil</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in remission, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dion</ENAMEX> is taking a
much-needed career hiatus to focus on getting pregnant--a plan that supposedly
includes spending time "puttering around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> because it makes her feel
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maternal</ENAMEX>." Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> concedes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angelil</ENAMEX>'s treatment may
have affected his fertility, a "joyful" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dion</ENAMEX> says she'll give it the old
college try: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rene</ENAMEX> and I are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> like we've never been before, and we plan
to spend all our free time in bed!" she's quoted as saying.

            Also
reportedly spending a lot of free time in bed is "sassy" <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> talk show queen
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cristina Saralegui</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> says that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saralegui</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">musician Marcos Avila</ENAMEX>, is "an adventurer in love" who "awaken[ed] her to the
joys of sex." Saralegui waxes poetic about her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s "marvelously sensual
and virile" nature and is particularly wowed by his toe-sucking prowess. "For a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who grew up in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent school</ENAMEX> to have someone suck your toes is an
amazing sexual experience," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saralegui</ENAMEX> explains. (Keeping Tabs didn't go to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent school</ENAMEX>, but we'll take her word for it.) And the picture of domestic
bliss she paints? Positively charming. "When we get <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, exhausted from
taping, once I take off my false eyelashes and we crawl into bed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> says,
'Give me some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovin</ENAMEX>'--and I do!"

            Is
there something in the water? The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Enquirer</ENAMEX> reports that as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Renée Zellweger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Carrey</ENAMEX> checked in for a romantic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stonepine Resort</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carmel Valley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX>, she was giggling as he whispered in
her ear. "They rented <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, but occupied just one--and hardly ever left
it," smirks the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> . While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keeping Tabs</ENAMEX> was particularly fond of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> headline announcing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cameron Diaz "Likes Loud Sex &</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hates Matt Dillon</ENAMEX>," she was duly impressed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> 's prurient
interests managed to extend even to the great beyond. They report that the late
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bette Davis</ENAMEX> relieved her frustrations during the shooting of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX> film
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skeffington</ENAMEX> by romping in the proverbial <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hay</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman</ENAMEX>. "She'd be fine for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</TIMEX> then would tighten up again," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman</ENAMEX>
explains. "We'd have <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">another evening</TIMEX> together."

            The
only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tabloid types</ENAMEX> not scoring <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>, it seems, are those on higher
moral ground. Avowing their virginity are <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Kournikova</ENAMEX> ("I do
not let anyone even have a peek into my bed") and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enrique Iglesias</ENAMEX>,
who's said to be waiting for the right <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>. ("Good for you, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enrique</ENAMEX>," coos
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlene Tilton</ENAMEX>.) In a story titled "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Simmons</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sad</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lonely Life</ENAMEX>," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> reports that the flamboyant exercise guru
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prefers food</ENAMEX> to sex, which he says is "overrated." Meanwhile <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lola Falana</ENAMEX>, now a
devoted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> who spends much of her time at a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Carmelite</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX>, tells the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> she's been celibate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.

            When
they're not having constant sex or actively refraining from it, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebs</ENAMEX> seem to
be busy entertaining flirtatious, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolgirl</ENAMEX> crushes on one another. We're not
sure if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Carrey</ENAMEX> knows it, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> says that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renée Zellweger</ENAMEX> has
a "huge infatuation" with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul McCartney</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> reports that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Britney Spears</ENAMEX> has a "major crush" on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prince William</ENAMEX> and even tried
to ply him with "provocative photos showing off her famous curves." (But then
again, she really is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolgirl</ENAMEX>, so maybe that's all right.)

            
Perhaps the strangest mutual admiration society is that between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and the famously curvy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aretha Franklin</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX>
says that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> traded saucy mash notes behind the scenes at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Correspondents</ENAMEX>' Dinner--ferried between them, no less, by "a young,
red-headed intern." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> has reportedly long been "suspicious" about
her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s "fixation" on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franklin</ENAMEX> and once had to elbow him in the stomach
"to get him to stop staring at her unbelievable cleavage" during a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>
concert. It's apparently all in the cleavage. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> ,
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s recent display of her own décolletage was actually a
pronouncement about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of her marriage: That revealing new wardrobe and
snazzy haircut are a dead giveaway that "it's just a matter of time" before she
divorces the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. "Whenever <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> really change their hairstyle
dramatically," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> explains, "they're maybe looking to change
their romantic life, too. Watch out!"

            Finally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX>
says that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer Love Hewitt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Michael</ENAMEX> are crushed out
on "swivel-hipped" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ricky Martin</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> concurs, reporting that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael</ENAMEX> is "smitten" with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> heartthrob, and is "particularly taken with
his smile." Meanwhile the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> --which also labels <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martin</ENAMEX>
"swivel-hipped"--investigates the possibility that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> might be gay with
all the meticulousness of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> proceeding. On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hand, there is the
incriminating fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> "wouldn't do anything to his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-bedroom,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">all-white Miami Beach</ENAMEX> pad without the advice of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decorator</ENAMEX>"; on the other,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">singer Alejandra Guzmán</ENAMEX> insists that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX>'s "moves are as great as his
kisses," and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adriana de Biega</ENAMEX> claims that her <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> of lovemaking with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> was "pure magic." Keeping Tabs can only wonder if there was toe-sucking
involved.
