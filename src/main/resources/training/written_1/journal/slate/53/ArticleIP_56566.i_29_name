            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> is bound by law to
decide by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-2000</TIMEX> whether or not to begin deployment of a limited defense
against long-range <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>. What is the history of missile defense? Could a
missile system protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>? Which nations pose the greatest
threat to this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>? And what are the diplomatic repercussions of building
such a system?

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> administration proposed the
"Sentinel" missile defense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> to defend against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> missile attack.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX> touted an even more limited
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Safeguard</ENAMEX>" system to defend the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile silos</ENAMEX>. As permitted by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ABM Treaty</ENAMEX> inked with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> unveiled an
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8 billion</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">100-</ENAMEX>missile site in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Dakota</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>. That site was closed only
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months later</TIMEX> as a waste of money. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, did not produce a
missile that could hit <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Star Wars</ENAMEX>" speech
resurrected the missile defense debate. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ten years</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$27 billion</NUMEX> later nothing
had been built. Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> started plumping for a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$72</NUMEX>
billion space-based "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Brilliant Pebbles</ENAMEX>" defense system. Its mission was to
knock out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warheads</ENAMEX> fired by accident or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
weapons fired by hubris.

            The technology wasn't
there for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brilliant Pebbles</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> announced
the "end of the Star Wars era." Missile defense spending puttered along in
research mode until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1998</TIMEX> when a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> study warned of the potential for
missile mayhem by such "rogue <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>" as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX>. A month
later, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> fired a three-stage rocket over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rocket</ENAMEX> failed to
orbit its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">satellite</ENAMEX> but demonstrated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pyongyang</ENAMEX>'s unsuspected ballistic prowess.
Then, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last July</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> maneuvered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> into signing a law
pledging action as soon as possible--which means building a running missile
defense system by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>.

            Current plans envision spending <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10.5 billion</NUMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>
to deploy perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> high-speed interceptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> that could deal
only with a handful of incoming warheads. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> radars around the world would be
upgraded to service this site, which could eventually be bolstered by other
ground-, ship-, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>-based anti-missile <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strategically</ENAMEX>, few dispute the merits of perfecting
"theater" defenses, such as the upgraded <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Patriot</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX> to swat down
low-flying shorter-range <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> on overseas battlefields, but the genuine
operational need for a missile defense system for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> remains a
much-gnawed bone of contention.

            Over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100 billion</NUMEX> in
current dollars has been spent on missile defense since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early '60s</TIMEX>, but the
task of hitting a hypersonic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bullet</ENAMEX> with a bullet remains a ticklish <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. Even
if the feat could be pulled off under laboratory conditions, real-world
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">attackers</ENAMEX> would load their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> with decoy warheads to foil or complicate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interdiction</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> insist that relatively cheap countermeasures will always
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trump</ENAMEX> costly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile defenses</ENAMEX>.

            After numerous highly publicized failures, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> successfully tested both its medium-range <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theater High-Altitude Area</ENAMEX>
Defense anti-missile and a prototype of the long-range, high-speed Ground-Based
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interceptor</ENAMEX> slated for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> site. But <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only four</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> planned interceptor
tests will be completed by the time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> must make his go or no-go decision
to deploy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>. An independent study funded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> warned in
mid-November that hasty deployment of the system could undermine its eventual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX>.

            In a recently
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">declassified</ENAMEX> estimate, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> projected that over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 15 years</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> will face missile threats from "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX>, probably
from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>, and possibly from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> today is struggling to maintain some
4,500 warheads mounted on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> has long abandoned
thoughts of defending against a full <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> onslaught--even a launch
unauthorized by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> would easily swamp the proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">defenses</ENAMEX>. In any
event, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> terms an accidental <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> firing "highly unlikely so long as
current technical and procedural safeguards are in place."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> boasts some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> that could hit the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> and is working to supplement that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> with more survivable,
mobile launchers. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> could never trump the warhead blizzard <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> would
send in retaliation against any atomic attack, though the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> would be
loath to cede to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile defenses</ENAMEX> the deterrence afforded by its handfuls
of warheads. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>'s opposition seems to be driven more by apprehension that
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> might provide theater <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile defenses</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> views
as a renegade <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>. Also the recently declassified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> assessment assumes
that the "rogue <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>" are likely to view their few ICBMs more as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deterrence</ENAMEX> and coercive diplomacy than as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of war.

            The crux of the strategic
controversy is whether an imperfect <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> defense could eliminate the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deterrent</ENAMEX> and coercive impact of small rogue missile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>. Any nation
determined to explode a nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uncle Sam</ENAMEX>'s front yard would have to be
insane to deliver the insult by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX>--it might as well affix a return
address to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> before firing. Detonating a smuggled warhead in the hold
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> docked in, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> would make much more sense, while
avoiding the huge expense and trouble of building complex intercontinental
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rockets</ENAMEX>. If this logic holds, missile defense is a job for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Customs</ENAMEX>, not
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>.

            Yet the prospect of an atomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">apocalypse</ENAMEX> is so terrible
that few can argue against spending <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens of billions of dollars</NUMEX> for insurance
against remote possibilities. Here's where the debate enters the diplomatic
arena. Could this anti-missile insurance policy reawaken a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX>
confrontation thought dead, lo, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these past 10 years</TIMEX>?

            The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ABM Treaty</ENAMEX>
permits the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> to deploy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> interceptors to defend
either a missile field or the national <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> chose to guard
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> with their <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>.) Even the initial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> slated
for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> would violate this pact due to their nationwide coverage. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
blinks the green light <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next summer</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> would be in breach of the treaty
by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-2001</TIMEX>, if it hopes to meet the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX> deadline.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> has asked <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> to amend the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABM</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treaty</ENAMEX>--which most missile defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> view as an outdated <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaur</ENAMEX> anyway. Against the backdrop of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> bombing campaign against
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX>, tension over the civil war in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chechnya</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>' failure to ratify
a treaty banning nuclear tests, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> political establishment drifting
toward intransigence seems unlikely to give the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> a free pass on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile defenses</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> might respond to a breached <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ABM Treaty</ENAMEX> by
abandoning other treaties designed to further reduce the current stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warheads</ENAMEX>. Thus, the construction of a limited shield against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> might spark a renewed nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> race with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and ultimately reduce
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> security.

            The missile defense debate has been as much about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">faith</ENAMEX> and ideological fervor as about logic and rational calculation. If the
past is any guide, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Missile Defense</ENAMEX> will probably be stymied
by the same technical, diplomatic, and financial factors that doomed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s
Sentinel, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Safeguard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>'s Star Wars, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s Brilliant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pebbles</ENAMEX>.
