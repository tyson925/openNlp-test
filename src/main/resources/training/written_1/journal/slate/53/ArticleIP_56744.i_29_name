               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            The greatest scene in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kings</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this season</TIMEX>'s best movie about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX>, (which is,
incidentally, a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oscar</ENAMEX> category thanks to a generous contribution from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobil-Exxon</ENAMEX>), comes at the end, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Army</ENAMEX> makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Clooney</ENAMEX> hand
over all those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iraqis</ENAMEX>--right at the border! The camera goes in
tight to show the complex emotions and various facial tics playing across
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clooney</ENAMEX>'s handsome mug, and we hear a fusillade of gunfire--it seems to go on
forever!--announcing the cynicism and greed and callousness that underlie the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf War</ENAMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> are slaughtered. OK. That was the ending they didn't
shoot. And, for all I know, didn't write. But the one that actually ended the
movie was good too, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clooney</ENAMEX> finally proposes to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> right in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomingdale's</ENAMEX> for gosh sakes, and all the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> applaud and
applaud--it seems to go on forever--announcing the cynicism and greed and
callousness that underlie <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas shopping</TIMEX> or marriage or movies or
something. And then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clint Eastwood</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> blast the hell out of the menswear
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>. Cool!

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Seventh Money Show Opens: Complete Kuwaiti Support</ENAMEX>
to Foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX>"

            I, for one, breathe easier knowing that a favorable
investment climate prevails in our <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">ally</ENAMEX>.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX> story on the page, behind "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Helping Hand</ENAMEX>
to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Families of Convicts" and "Campaign Against Drugs to Continue</ENAMEX>," is the only
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuwaiti</ENAMEX> story to make most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> papers: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Parliament Agrees To Discuss</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'Urgent</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Replacement Bill, Women's Decree Fails, 'Rights' Remain Alive</ENAMEX>."

            What is more delightful, the sarcastic quotation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marks</ENAMEX> around "urgent" or the snide quotation marks around "rights"? Either way,
some savvy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editorializing</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parliament</ENAMEX> rejected by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41-21</NUMEX> a decree by
the emir granting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> the right to vote and run for office. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX>
who say they support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s rights say they voted no out of principle: the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emir's</ENAMEX> decree undermined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX>'s authority. Interesting principle.

            

               Scores
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> attended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s session, sitting in a reserved section of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> applauded when the result of the vote was announced.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fundamentalist Ahmed Baqer</ENAMEX> also drew applause from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> when he screamed,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kuwaiti</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't want (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s rights)! Why do you want to force it on
them?" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Liberal lawmaker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sami Al-Munayes</ENAMEX> accused many of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> of
hiding behind the constitutional excuse, while in their hearts they wanted "to
deny <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the society the right to live."
