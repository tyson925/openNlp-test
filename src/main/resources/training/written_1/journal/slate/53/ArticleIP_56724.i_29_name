            When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> set out to
discover which religious denominations have the best sex, they learned that the
faithful don't do all their shouting in church. Conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> survey found, report by far the most orgasms: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Thirty-two percent</NUMEX> say
they achieve orgasm every time they make love. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mainline Protestants</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholics</ENAMEX> lagged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> points behind. Those with no religious affiliation were
at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 percent</NUMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unitarians</ENAMEX> may not wish to read any further.)

            What are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phyllis</ENAMEX>
Schlaflys of the world--those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</NUMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTA</ENAMEX> moms--doing in bed that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agnostics</ENAMEX> and unbelievers are not? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education</ENAMEX> may explain some of their sexual
satisfaction. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> for how.) But they also may be getting better sex advice.
Thanks to evangelism's surge during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past quarter-century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">golden</ENAMEX> age for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> sex manuals. Evangelicals may not want their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
to study sex ed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, but they are not afraid of studying a little sex ed
in their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX>.

            The modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> sex advice business dates to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>,
when the evangelical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marabel Morgan</ENAMEX> achieved brief notoriety for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Total</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Woman</ENAMEX> . Morgan famously suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> spice up their marriage by
greeting their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX> at the door wearing nothing but <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saran Wrap</ENAMEX>--a seduction
attempted with sad consequences for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathy Bates</ENAMEX> in the movie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fried Green</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tomatoes</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Dobson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the evangelical group Focus on the
Family, published a sex-and-marriage book in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Best-selling Christian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">authors Tim</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beverly LaHaye</ENAMEX> followed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX> (also <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wessel</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Joy of Natural Childbirth</ENAMEX> , which taught <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamaze</ENAMEX> from a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> perspective). Scores of books have followed, selling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of
copies.

            While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marabel Morgan</ENAMEX>
book aimed chiefly to comfort and instruct the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> on holding the attention of
her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>--implying without subtlety that any sexual problems were her
fault--later <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> have expanded the boundaries of the field, which is now
marketed as "family counseling," a category that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-rearing,
lovemaking, marital relations and, of course, sexual orientation. Today, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">genre</ENAMEX> has even subdivided into niche markets. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teens</ENAMEX> can buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I Kissed Dating</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodbye</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joshua Harris</ENAMEX>, which counsels against early sexual experience.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Earl Johnson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Single Life: Being Your Best for God as He Prepares His Best</ENAMEX>
for You assures black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> that their single status, which demographics
may brutally enforce, can be "a celebration rather than a burden." Numerous
books target <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX> for "recovery," including Coming Out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homosexuality</ENAMEX> ,
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Davies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dean</ENAMEX> of the ex-gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evangelists</ENAMEX>.

            Sex-and-marriage guides are the best sellers of the genre,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim LaHaye</ENAMEX> has emerged as its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Alex Comfort</ENAMEX>. If you're a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> who wants
to go forth and multiply, he's your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX>. Lately on the best-seller lists for
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> apocalyptic novels in his "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Left Behind</ENAMEX>" series, which have sold nearly
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 million</NUMEX> copies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LaHaye</ENAMEX> has long been a household name among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fundamentalists</ENAMEX>
for his works on sexual and family life. His most famous book, the wonderfully
titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">How To Be Happy Though Married</ENAMEX> , hearkens back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another era</TIMEX>, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> both quaint and disturbing. LaHaye rehashes all the conventional ideas
about male and female sexuality. For example, he perpetuates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freudian</ENAMEX> myth
about vaginal vs. clitoral orgasms, and he views male sexuality as essentially
dangerous. "The sex drive in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is almost volcanic in its latent ability to
erupt at the slightest provocation." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> are stimulated by sight, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LaHaye</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> by words and touch. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LaHaye</ENAMEX> scheme, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Testament</ENAMEX> is a sexual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guide</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5:28</TIMEX>, for instance, says, "But I say unto you, that whosoever
look unto a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in
his heart." But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> made no such statement about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> because most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> do
not look at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> with lust. Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> "should be the initiator because of [his]
stronger sex drive," while "the role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> is to respond."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LaHaye</ENAMEX>'s books have
their share of quackery and pseudoscience, but that does not preclude some
genuinely wise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>--especially inexperienced ones. He is
wonderfully clear and clinical about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> of sex. Here is part of his
description of female sexual arousal, for example: "When a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> is sexually
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aroused</ENAMEX>, several of her glands begin to secrete a lubrication that bathes the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">vulva</ENAMEX> area with a slippery mucous, easing the entrance of the penis into the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vagina</ENAMEX>." For young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marrieds</ENAMEX> who have grown up shielded from the universal sex
talk of the secular world, these details are surely useful.

            Perhaps the most notable quality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> sex
business is that it is evangelical, not puritanical. It is very pro-sex--as
long as sex takes place in the context of marriage. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaye Wheat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Intended for Pleasure: Sex Technique and Sexual Fulfillment</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian</ENAMEX>
Marriage , may curiously advise "taking an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> or alkaline douche just
before intercourse" to select the sex of one's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> (they don't say which
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">douche</ENAMEX> is for which sex), but their overall tone is both practical and sensual.
They note that lubricant works best if you first "warm the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K-Y Jelly</ENAMEX> by holding
the tube in warm, running <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>." They advise that newlyweds should "not get a
TV set for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least one year</TIMEX>" and that "every master <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> needs a good
lock." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wheats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LaHaye</ENAMEX> offer finely wrought anatomical diagrams,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exhortations</ENAMEX> to married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> to communicate, reminders to "observe daily
hygiene habits," and constant refrains about making sure to satisfy your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Davies</ENAMEX> allows that masturbation is biblically permissible. The
Wheats condemn oral sex and vibrators only because they might be too fun, thus
souring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> on intercourse. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> do not invoke the language of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sin</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counselors</ENAMEX>
are most alienating to worldly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> when they talk about masculinity and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homosexuality</ENAMEX>. They are obsessed with manliness and have a narrow idea of what
that means. Self-styled natural law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theologian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Moccia</ENAMEX> writes in
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Happily Ever After: How To Stay Married and Be Happy Too</ENAMEX>! that "a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> has more of a chance to keep his marriage together if he is rough and
abusive but assertive than if he is kind and considerate but submissive."
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moccia</ENAMEX>'s greatest professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">qualification</ENAMEX>, according to the jacket flap, is
an appearance on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morton Downey Jr.</ENAMEX> Show .) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moccia</ENAMEX>'s tone is
atypically harsh, but his message is shared by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counselors</ENAMEX>. Noted preacher
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T.D. Jakes</ENAMEX>, who presides over a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> of books, tapes, and TV
shows, wants to "heal" not just <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX>, but all "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who are feminine in
their mannerisms." These <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> contend unequivocally that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX>
can simply turn straight through faith and willpower. They generally describe
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX> with crude stereotypes. In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">What Everyone Should Know About</ENAMEX>
Homosexuality , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LaHaye</ENAMEX> employs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galen</ENAMEX>'s theory of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> humors to help
explain gayness. "It has been my observation," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LaHaye</ENAMEX> writes, "that most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX> reflect a high degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Melancholy temperament"--</ENAMEX>"sensitive,
artistic, gifted."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> love <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> believe, against all evidence,
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX> can squelch their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX> their essences.
Still, for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the tens of millions</NUMEX> of married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> who just need a little
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cheerleading</ENAMEX>--or a detailed diagram--their books may literally be a godsend.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LaHaye</ENAMEX>'s advice, from the most florid talk of "eruptive" and "electrifying"
touches to his prim injunction to "refrain from the use of back-alley words"
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">coitus</TIMEX>, won't please everybody. But with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2 million</NUMEX> copies
sold, he's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evangelist</ENAMEX> who is spreading the good news.
