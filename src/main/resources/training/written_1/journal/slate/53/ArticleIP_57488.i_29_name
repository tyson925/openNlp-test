               A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomat</ENAMEX> was accused of spying on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> The
low-level embassy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> was allegedly caught monitoring a listening device
planted inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>. Though diplomatic immunity prevents him
from being prosecuted, he was ordered to leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX>. One
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> expelled an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomat</ENAMEX> for spying. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kremlin</ENAMEX> deemed it "an eye for an eye " approach reminiscent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX>. But
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> said the timing was coincidental and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomat</ENAMEX>'s actions posed
a serious threat to national security.

            

               A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> determined that there was a conspiracy to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Luther</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Jr.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King family</ENAMEX> had filed a wrongful-death suit against
Memphis cafe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loyd Jowers</ENAMEX>, who said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years ago</TIMEX> that he hired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assassin</ENAMEX> on behalf of many others. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King family</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> argued that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mafia</ENAMEX>, and media conspired to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> because of his political
views. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Observers</ENAMEX> debated whether the decision vindicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Earl Ray</ENAMEX>, who
was convicted of the assassination, or implicated him in a larger plot. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>'s spin: This is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step toward correcting the history books. Law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enforcement</ENAMEX>'s spin: The
theory's so ludicrous no one else will buy it.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> failed to communicate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars Polar Lander</ENAMEX>. The
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$165 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> and its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two $29 million</NUMEX> probes have not been heard from
since they descended to the planet's south pole <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> said the
prospects for the mission--which had aimed to gather information on the Martian
climate and determine whether it ever sustained life--were
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dim</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> lost the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$125 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars Climate Orbiter</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Observers</ENAMEX> said the latest loss would yield a "t otal reassessment " of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s programs and delay future
missions. Congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>' spin: If they can't do it right, let's cut the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>'s budget. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s spin: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inadequate</ENAMEX> funding is what caused this in the first
place.

            

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> is threatening more lawsuits against
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>. The class-action suits, which would be brought by local
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public-housing authorities</ENAMEX> and coordinated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, would
demand reimbursement for security and other costs of handgun violence. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> said it would drop the lawsuits if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> accepted safety
provisions demanded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> currently suing the industry. Gun controllers'
spin: Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> wouldn't act, a lawsuit is the next best thing. The gun
lobby's spin: The lawsuits are baseless and won't hold up in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Newspapers</ENAMEX>'
spin: They'll never get that far , since <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> can't withstand the
federal onslaught.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> is demanding the return of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 6-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>. Eli√°n
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonz√°lez</ENAMEX> was one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who survived the sinking of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17-foot</NUMEX> aluminum
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> perished in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shipwreck</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> have demonstrated, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel Castro</ENAMEX> has
threatened retribution if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gonz√</ENAMEX>°lez is not returned to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>. After
insisting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX>'s fate would be decided in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
administration now says it will follow the wishes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>' spin: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is capitulating to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s spin:
No, we're putting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s needs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>' counterspin: How do we
know what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> wants when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> is speaking for him ? The consensus: The sooner
Gonz√°lez is out of the spotlight, the better.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> held their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> debate in a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> date was hastily scheduled in response to a request
from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>, who missed the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> debates. Pundits deemed it a
"courteous" and "chummy" affair, with "policy agreements ‚Ä¶ much more conspicuous than disputes." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> differed as to
whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s subdued performance was or tepid and formulaic; but they agreed
that this cautious approach would keep him ahead. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX>
needs to be more aggressive in differentiating himself from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>; others said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> needs to remain subtle to avoid drawing fire for his temper.

               A maintenance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> was convicted of mishandling hazardous material
linked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ValuJet</ENAMEX> crash. SabreTech, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX>, was
found guilty on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> counts related to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> accident that killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> were acquitted of lying on repair records. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>,
which is out of business but not bankrupt, could be fined <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.25 million</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SabreTech</ENAMEX> called the acquittals a vindication of its view that the crash "was a
tragedy. It wasn't a crime." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Victims</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> debated whether the convictions

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Organization</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> meeting ended with no new
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">accord</ENAMEX>. Previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX> rules will remain in effect since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators</ENAMEX>
failed to agree on how to reduce trade barriers further. The meetings were
disrupted by protests, which resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 500</NUMEX> arrests and sometimes
violent clashes with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>'s police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> announced that he would
resign and "takes full responsibility for the riots." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> critics
called the talks "an
embarrassment" and accused the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of failing to make a clear
case for free trade. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Protesters</ENAMEX> hailed it as a victory
for their movement, which they claimed had turned public opinion against
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegates</ENAMEX> chalked up the collapse to "the complexity and novelty

<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> championship. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second year</TIMEX>, a computer ranking system,
instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sportswriters</ENAMEX>' polls, determined the matchup. Both
