<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jersey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> opened crates and pulled out pheasants, then, holding them
by the legs, spun the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> around to make them dizzy; this is one feature of a
program whose uneasy combination of private and state funding is drawing
increasing criticism nationwide. What is the program called?

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            Among many native
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peoples</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> are cherished and respected for their funny smell. That's
what I learned in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anthropology</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> who had to be at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX>,
kept on the job by tenure and a network of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teflon</ENAMEX> tubing that functioned much
like an actual large intestine. Who can blame him for lying to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gullible</ENAMEX>
young? He had every reason to be angry: Old age is an unforgivable insult.
Consider the sex lives of older <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>. (As did most quiz <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, with
disturbing vividness.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> are damned if they do and damned if they
don't; damned and mocked if they can't; and damned, mocked, and pointed out by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> if they can but only with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pharmacological aids</ENAMEX> or an elaborate
arrangement of winches and pulleys. The sad fact of an extended life span is
that you get those extra <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> tacked on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at the end</TIMEX>, extending your frailty and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">neglect</ENAMEX>, not added to your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20s</TIMEX>, extending your time in ersatz anthropology
classes. The other horrifying consequence of a greatly extended life
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">span</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strom Thurmond</ENAMEX>'s ass. Thank you! <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX> to be back!

            New standards specify <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6-inch</NUMEX> letters on street
signs so elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> can read them.

            "They're just a lot easier to see," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lou</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerard</ENAMEX>, highway <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superintendent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clifton Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, where they've begun
switching to the new signs at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50</NUMEX> a pop each time an old one must be
replaced.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Highway</ENAMEX>
Administration predicts that by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>--and I know a cheap joke when I see it,
especially from some smarty-pants highway <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX>--one out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> will be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65 or older</TIMEX>. And damn mad about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>.

            Every commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX> makes assumptions about
its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. Judging by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WIRELESS</ENAMEX> , a catalog for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of
public radio, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Helms</ENAMEX> can quit worrying. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX> are bland, white,
