            The spaceship comes down in your backyard, crushing
a bed of petunias, and out steps the alien. This is always an awkward social
moment. What, exactly, do you say to someone who may hold the secrets to the
universe? After, that is, you finish quivering and quaking and wondering if he
(she? it?) is going to suck you down like a raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oyster</ENAMEX>?

            Obviously you would want
to get some information out of the alien--no easy trick, to judge from most
alien-encounter narratives. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> who show up in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the middle of the night</TIMEX>
and abduct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are notoriously stingy with information. They never solve any
mathematical equations. They don't offer up the long-sought simple and
"elegant" proof of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fermat's Last Theorem</ENAMEX>. They don't tell us where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Hoffa</ENAMEX>
is buried.

            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> do communicate with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, they're always a
bit like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Rennie</ENAMEX> alien in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX> movie <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Day the Earth Stood</ENAMEX>
Still : They tell us to behave. They say we need to get our act together.
They're self-help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gurus</ENAMEX>. A fellow named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darryl Anka</ENAMEX> channeled an alien named
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bashar</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bashar</ENAMEX>, though wise, didn't really have much data to
offer, just advice on how to live a better life. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anka</ENAMEX>, when I last spoke to
him, said he'd given up channeling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bashar</ENAMEX> and was working on designing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">UFO</ENAMEX>
theme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>.)

            There's a scene in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sagan</ENAMEX>'s excellent novel Contact when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellie Arroway</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protagonist</ENAMEX>,
whooshes down some kind of intragalactic "wormhole" and winds up on a sunny
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">beach</ENAMEX>, face to face with an alien. The alien, annoyingly, doesn't seem to know
who built that wormhole <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway system</ENAMEX>. Eventually <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arroway</ENAMEX> gets around to asking
what is no doubt her most urgent question: "I want to know what you think of
us, what you really think."

            Wow. That's really the wrong question there. That's blowing
it big time. This gal crosses half the galaxy and is tossed and rattled
around to within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an inch</NUMEX> of her life, and when it's over she starts fishing for
a compliment!

            No, a better question to an alien would be: What
are you made of? Are you based on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> and liquid water? Do you have
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> as your information-bearing molecule or something like it?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Jay Gould</ENAMEX> put it this way, on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferris</ENAMEX>' recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS program Life Beyond Earth</ENAMEX> : "What's your
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">biochemistry?</ENAMEX>"

            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> may argue that other questions should
precede the biological ones. They might, for example, choose a political
question, asking who, exactly, is in charge of this universe. Or they may skew
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">theological</ENAMEX>, and ask if there's a God and what exactly he's got on his
mind.

            A good argument could be
made that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicist</ENAMEX> should pose the first batch of questions to an alien,
asking whether it's possible to go faster than the speed of light and whether
there are other universes outside our own. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicist</ENAMEX> and the alien would no
doubt get embroiled in a discussion of string theory, and soon they'd be
jotting down incomprehensible equations <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10</NUMEX>-dimensional vibrating loops.
Maybe at the end of the encounter we'd figure out how to yank free energy out
of the quantum vacuum. We'd have a new trick for cooking a hot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>.

            My feeling is that the biology questions trump everything
else. We know essentially nothing about life beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>. Because we are
ignorant of other biological systems, we have no context for understanding
Earth life, for knowing to what extent the life we see around us is, on the
cosmic scale, relatively ordinary or totally freakish.

            We don't know, for
example, if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Earthlike</ENAMEX> planets are common. We look around our own solar system,
and what appears to be common are planets that have no life whatsoever. We also
see signs that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> were once more hospitable to life and over many
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> became inhospitable. Bad stuff happens to good
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">planets</ENAMEX>. It'd be nice to know more about that trend.

            We also don't know how life originates and to what extent
it evolves in an orderly pattern. The debate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> over the teaching of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evolution</ENAMEX> misses the real debates within the field. There are those who argue
passionately that life originated with a single replicated molecule. Another
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">camp</ENAMEX> favors the notion that it began with a kind of garbage bag of molecules
that more or less eased its way from nonlife to life. And the biggest question
may be to what extent evolution is divergent or convergent. Divergence gives us
a bewildering variety of life; convergence gives rise, repeatedly, to certain
anatomical features, like wings and eyeballs. You can make an argument that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> is an extremely unlikely, random, quirky event in terrestrial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biology</ENAMEX>, or you can make the counter-argument that you can see intelligence
coming down the pike from many <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in advance. On that issue
hinges the abundance of intelligent life in the universe.

            How likely is it that life elsewhere will go
through the same evolutionary leaps as life on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>? To take one obscure but
critical example: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> remained entirely <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-celled for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 billion</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least half</NUMEX> of that time, those cells didn't have a nucleus. They
couldn't use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> in their metabolism. They were pitiful even by microbial
standards. So, how lucky was the evolutionary leap from prokaryotes
(non-nucleated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX>) to eukaryotes (nucleated, and using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>)? It
happened here <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 2.1 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>. Was that our lucky break? Or does
life, in general, figure out the trick of using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> and growing big and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brawny</ENAMEX>?

            And, of course, we don't
really know what we're talking about when we talk about "intelligence." We tend
to think of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> that use technology and language. But that could be
shortsighted. Maybe most intelligent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creatures</ENAMEX> are dolphinoids, blissfully
swimming in an alien ocean with little interest in building <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spaceships</ENAMEX>.

            Imagine for a moment that we could see the universe through
the eyes of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">alien creature</ENAMEX>. Would the universe look more or less the same?
Or would we be confused, dazzled, and feel as though we were hallucinating?

            Are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> interested in the same things that
interest us? Could we carry on a meaningful conversation?

            We should prepare
ourselves for finding something out there that's totally unexpected. And we
have to prepare for bad news, or at least bad news in the context of our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star Trek</ENAMEX> fantasy. We may have wildly overestimated the abundance of
extraterrestrial civilizations. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Sagan</ENAMEX> thought there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> such
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">civilizations</ENAMEX> in existence right now in our own galaxy. The actual number may
be a handful. Or we could be, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sagan</ENAMEX>'s old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collaborator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.S. Shklovskii</ENAMEX>
argued, "<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">functionally</ENAMEX> alone." Not literally alone, just so isolated that
there's no practical way to make contact of any kind with another intelligent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.

            Whatever we do, we shouldn't take ourselves for granted.
There may be something extremely rare and wonderful about a world in which
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water splashes</ENAMEX> on the surface, and where life survives for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 4 billion</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, where it has the leisure to evolve and, through natural selection,
explore the possibilities of complexity.

            The search for life beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> always doubles
back to our own existence. Why are we this way? How did we come about? How
special is it to be a thinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>? This is the kind of stuff you'd want
to discuss with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>. And remember, they like it when you compliment them
on the really cool spaceship.
