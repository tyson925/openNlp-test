               To justify a current policy, a well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> cites these
conditions: "unrelenting crowding, lack of privacy, infrequent communications

Wrap-Up
            

            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> used
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s question as an outlet for anti-airline hostility, which most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">therapists</ENAMEX>
believe is healthier than slapping a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-pilot</ENAMEX> (most, but not all). One thing to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bear</ENAMEX> in mind: It is not the squeaky wheel that gets the grease; it is the wheel
on whatever vehicle the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who owns the grease gun (grease can? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">greasicator</ENAMEX>?)
is riding. That is, these things--transportation policy, lubrication
policy--are decided not by what is most needed but by who is in need. Because
so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressmen</ENAMEX> fly so frequently, the aviation industry gets much federal
attention. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> crash so frequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX> devotes
round-the-clock coverage to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€¦ wait, that doesn't quite follow. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> crashed frequently, they'd be dead and hence unable to demand such
boring programs. And those few who've not yet plummeted to a fiery death
possess so vivid a sense of their own mortality, that they'd instantly cancel
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry King</ENAMEX> . OK, look at it this way: If more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressmen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> rode the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>, would suffer
from unrelenting crowding, lack of privacy, infrequent communications with
family and the outside world. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressmen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> would be
incredibly late to work because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRT</ENAMEX> stops neither in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> nor
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX>. But don't think this lets those bastards at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> off the hook.

            A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> assessment by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Navy</ENAMEX> supports the
continued exclusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> from serving on submarines.

            It is unsurprising that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>, generally
regarded as the most hidebound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the military (and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> most
resistant to ending racial segregation), found a compelling need, in the
national interest and for essential military purposes that you wouldn't
understand, to sustain a reactionary social policy. What is unexpected is that
the debate on submarine duty has been reopened. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason: money. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> is
building a new class of submarines, and it would be less expensive to include
separate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the initial construction than to make
changes later, should <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> at some point be granted the vote.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> serve on submarines in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navies</ENAMEX> of other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nations</ENAMEX>, including those of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX>, but there is much
opposition within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">submarine</ENAMEX> service to altering the current policy: "I
only know one way, the way I was brought up," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cmdr</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Foggo</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 rd</TIMEX> , commanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> of the attack submarine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">City</ENAMEX> . "Now if you'll excuse me, I'm late for the flogging," he did not
add.

            To repeat: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cmdr</ENAMEX>. Foggo

            Oh, yes: Foggo

            Foggo, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Foggo</ENAMEX>, face like
a froggo!--hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">schoolyard</ENAMEX> chant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years ago</TIMEX> that accounts for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX>'s hypothetical hostility to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlene Barshefsky</ENAMEX>. Can you identify the source of each of these descriptions

               "She's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">one-woman</ENAMEX> phenomenon"-- an admiring comment from her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mickey Kantor</ENAMEX>.
               

               "the slight, intense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>"-- a presumptuous comment from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. Sanger</ENAMEX>, writing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>. (He means "bitchy," doesn't he?
Oh, I know the code words. I don't remember him ever calling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mickey Kantor</ENAMEX> a
"slight, intense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bastard</ENAMEX>.)
               

               "a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Slovenian</ENAMEX> supermodel"-- a surprisingly restrained comment from former
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adjective-abuser Rick Bragg</ENAMEX>, but not about Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barshefsky</ENAMEX>. He was referring to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melania Knauss</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX>, not directly involved in the trade
talks.
               

               "At once jubilant and exhausted"-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Sanger</ENAMEX> again. At least he's
stopped picking on Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barshefsky</ENAMEX> for failing to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 feet</NUMEX> tall, like some
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specimen</ENAMEX> in his own private human <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX>.
               

               "a shrinking <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">violet</ENAMEX> in her purple tunic"-- an unnecessarily catty comment
from sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Finn</ENAMEX> (again, nothing to do with Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barshefsky</ENAMEX>),
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">kicking tennis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Kournikova</ENAMEX> when she's down. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kournikova</ENAMEX> is said to
have some innovative ideas on the trade pact. (Said by me. Based on no evidence
whatever.)
               

               "the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>dense core of an exploded star"-- an informative comment
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> science <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm Browne</ENAMEX> -- not about Ms.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> -- defining either an inspiraling neutron <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss Liza Minnelli</ENAMEX>.
I meant to go back and check, but now I've thrown that section away.
               

               "I've never seen anyone who can operate better on no sleep, totally
hung-over, after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">partying all night</TIMEX> with her whole def <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX>."-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mickey Kantor</ENAMEX>
again, although his actual remarks end with the word "sleep," after which I
take over. It's just a theory. I learned it from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Kournikova</ENAMEX>. In the sense
of making it up as if she'd said it.
