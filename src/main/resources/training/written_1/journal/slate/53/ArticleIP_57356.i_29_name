            At the end of yet another <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">36-hour</TIMEX> shift, just one
task lay between me and blessed sleep: threading a central venous catheter from
my fortysomething <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s neck into the blood vessels near his heart. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX>
(not his real name) was suffering from liver failure, caused by the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C
virus he'd contracted from shooting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX> with contaminated needles. In most
cases, an ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> does the job ferrying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX> was
a tough <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> stick. A "central line" was essential.

            Hands shaking, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX> signed a consent form after I
outlined the risks of the procedure--bleeding, collapsed lung, infection. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX>
was all too familiar with the risks of infection, thanks to me, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inexperienced</ENAMEX>, haggard medical intern. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A day earlier</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX> had been the
recipient of my first central-line placement. The incision became infected--a
potentially deadly complication for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bob</ENAMEX> because liver damage weakens the immune
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>--and I almost had to wheel him into the intensive-care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>.

            My supervising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> walked me through the
central-line procedure after we gowned up. I felt the spot on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX>'s throat,
nestled under muscle, where I would pierce the skin and hit the internal
jugular vein. My <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> jab with a "finder" needle filled the syringe with a
reassuring flashback of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>. After making certain I hadn't nicked an artery,
I inserted a larger needle into the skin just above the first needle. After the
large needle's flashback, I threaded a long coil into the blood <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> and into
the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> near the heart.

            Finished, we ordered a
chest X-ray to ensure the catheter was sitting in the right location. I left
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> relieved. But while on rounds <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours later</TIMEX>--after my blessed
sleep--a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> told me about the yellowish liquid oozing from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX>'s neck near
the catheter placement. I had punctured his thoracic duct, a collection of the
lymphatic fluid that carries infection-fighting cells throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>.

            When my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> began his internship in pediatrics 34 years
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>, most interns had, as medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, practiced catheter placement and
surgery on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> in a vivisection <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>. Today, thanks to
protests by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-vivisectionist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and a queasy public, few medical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> practice on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> study by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association of American</ENAMEX>
Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colleges</ENAMEX> found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 23</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> medical schools
required vivisection in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">physiology courses</ENAMEX> and just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> required it on
surgery rotations.

            That means that someone's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> is the first
living thing most medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interns</ENAMEX> stick with a needle, cut open, or sew back
up. Studies have found that rookie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> suffer no more
complications than the experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. But these studies are
flawed. Most were either conducted under well-controlled circumstances in the
most prestigious teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> or were too small to be statistically
significant. Also, some of these studies don't account for "near miss"
complications such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX>'s infection and punctured thoracic duct. Although
such mishaps may not have long-term effects, they do contribute to patient
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>. I know that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX> would have benefited if I had performed more line
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placements</ENAMEX>--on either <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.

            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> avoid teaching the technique of
central-line placement by employing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> of non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> who specialize in the
task. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> work well, but most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> can't afford them. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Doctors</ENAMEX>
should learn the technique themselves, especially in case of emergencies.

            Many medical schools
offer computer simulations and other alternatives such as "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stan</ENAMEX>" for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
who refuse to operate on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. Manufactured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medical Education</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technologies Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stan</ENAMEX> (short for "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Standard Man</ENAMEX>") is a realistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dummy</ENAMEX> upon
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> practice resuscitation. But despite all the sophisticated medical
monitors attached to him, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stan</ENAMEX> has his limitations: He'll never experience a
life-threatening emergency that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> you to work in less-than-ideal
conditions. If you fail <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stan</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> won't be waiting in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> for the
terrible news. And you can't practice central-line placement on him.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Doctors</ENAMEX> take their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX> where they can find it. Last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> army provoked public outrage when it admitted to using the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> of dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> to teach complex medical procedures to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>-in-training. The practice was revealed after one fallen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, himself a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>, noticed an incision on his son's neck. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> had
been killed in the line of duty, and no resuscitation attempt could explain the
surgical wound. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evidently</ENAMEX>, the army <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> had long condoned an unwritten rule
allowing medical practice on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> had given permission for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autopsies</ENAMEX>. (But this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> hadn't given autopsy permission.)

            Practicing on dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is nothing new. In
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Cook</ENAMEX>'s semi-autobiographical book, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Year of the Intern</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>),
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protagonist</ENAMEX> takes aim with an epinephrine-filled syringe at the still heart
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who moments before he had unsuccessfully tried to resuscitate.
Next he shoves a breathing tube down the dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s throat. Neither
exercise is intended to revive the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cook</ENAMEX> wrote in the journal the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharos</ENAMEX> about his own experience
observing as medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> practiced placing a breathing tube
into a freshly deceased <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.

            Exploiting the newly dead sounds ghoulish, but the
medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> rationalizes the practice--at least in private--by saying
that it's better than letting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interns</ENAMEX> fumble on live <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The practice is
common enough that a medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ethicist</ENAMEX> didn't raise eyebrows at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
where I completed my internship when he surveyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> about how many had
placed central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lines</ENAMEX> into comatose or on-the-verge-of-death <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Likewise,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX>'s chief medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>, responding to the public outrage,
said that if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> ban his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> from practicing on fallen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>, it
will be the injured who will suffer.

            So what's worse: defiling cadavers or practicing on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>? My <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold answer, even if it makes us all uneasy, is to
reintroduce vivisection on a limited basis to all medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and to allow
surgical practice on the recently dead donated bodies.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Each year</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 16,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> begin medical
school in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. One animal for every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> would mean the
sacrifice of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> per year. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are euthanized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>.
Might they be used for this purpose before meeting their ends if we make their
deaths as humane as possible? <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX> who object to animal experimentation
should be allowed to decline, but be required to spend extra time with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stan</ENAMEX> and
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>.

            As for human surgical practice, we should create a
system akin to organ donation: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> could give consent on their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX>'
licenses or when they're admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>. We could easily convince
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> of the similarities between donating your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> to medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dissection</ENAMEX> and donating it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> for practice. Still, there won't be
enough dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> to go around. If we won't sacrifice a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>, we'll have
to sacrifice our own comfort and safety, a sacrifice most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> or hospitals
don't really want to make.

            Even though Bob survived my amateur central-line
techniques, I'm guessing that he would have preferred a more experienced
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intern</ENAMEX>. I know how he feels. I rue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> when they strap me down for my
inevitable bypass operation. As I drift off into unconsciousness, the last
thing I want to hear the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX> say to a junior associate is "So this
is your first bypass? Well, the very <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step is the incision. Cut him there.
No! Not there! There! "
