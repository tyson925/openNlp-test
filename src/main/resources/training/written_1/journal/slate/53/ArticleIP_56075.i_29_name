            On
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Halloween</ENAMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Morris</ENAMEX> dressed up as a
populist visionary and went out on the Internet. His new Web site, vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> , asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to
"vote" yes or no on questions such as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Protect Gays from Hate Crimes?</ENAMEX>" and
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Increase the Minimum Wage?</ENAMEX>" Each time a user clicks a box taking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side or
the other, an e-mail is sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> conveying his
e-mail address and his position on the issue. "We'll send your
vote to your congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>, your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senators</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>,"
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> promises on the site's home page. This, he asserts, is "direct
democracy."

            Like
his past careers as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savior</ENAMEX>, confessor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accuser</ENAMEX>, and
pundit-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX>' latest incarnation is an act. He's not building
direct democracy. He's building a rather different political system, which
might more aptly be called dickmorrisy. How does dickmorrisy differ from
democracy? Let us count the ways.

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> picks the issues. As "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Frame Game</ENAMEX>" has previously , the power to
choose and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> questions is more profound than the power to choose and craft
answers. That's why other Web sites, such as faqvoter.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> pose
questions to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> on any topic. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris</ENAMEX> knows that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> rule of
politics is to dictate the agenda--and at vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, he's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX>. So while
vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Should Hillary Have Spoken Out</ENAMEX> when Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> Made
Controversial <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Comments About Israel?</ENAMEX>"--a no-win question about the woman <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morris</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">excoriates</ENAMEX> elsewhere on the site--it asks no similarly rigged question about
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudy Giuliani</ENAMEX>.

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> frames the arguments. "On vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, you can get the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros</ENAMEX> and cons on
various issues and cast your votes," <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Franken</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>. Well, not quite. What you get are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros</ENAMEX> and cons <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris</ENAMEX> chooses to
include. Take the question <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> posted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>: "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Admit China</ENAMEX> into the World
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade Organization</ENAMEX>?" At vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, you can click to read a few paragraphs of the
arguments on each side about economics and human rights, but there's nothing
about how "engagement" (as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side sees it) or "appeasement" (as the other
side sees it) might affect nuclear proliferation--a consideration that might
have changed your mind. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> never links you to sites that offer more
detailed arguments than his. He wants you to stay on his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX>, read his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">summaries</ENAMEX>, and pull the trigger.

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> simplifies your views. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris</ENAMEX> says vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> is "fully interactive"
and "gives us a chance to speak out and to be heard. When you vote … we'll send
an immediate e-mail to significant decision <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> … telling them how you
feel." But while you can explain the nuances of your position on a bulletin
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> at vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> (just as you can in 
                  Slate
               's "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fray"</ENAMEX>), the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only</NUMEX> thing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris</ENAMEX> lets you communicate to your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is yes or no. On
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vouchers</ENAMEX>, for example, I checked the box marked "Yes--Use competition to
improve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>," because I favor pilot voucher programs and public school
choice to shake up the education system. My vote was translated into an e-mail
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> stating, "On the question Vouchers for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schools</ENAMEX>? I voted
YES." Since <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 80 percent</NUMEX> of vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> have voted yes on this
question, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> will no doubt cite these "votes," including <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>, as a
mandate for nationwide private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> vouchers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> hasn't conveyed my
opinion. He has misrepresented it.

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> distorts your degree of interest. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris</ENAMEX> concedes that vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>
doesn't represent the whole population (since the average Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> is
wealthier and more educated than the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, for example), but he
argues that it faithfully simulates an election because it expresses the votes
of those "who care enough to speak out." He says he built vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> "to set up a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> to speak out" because "I trust the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>." Of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>
already had a way to speak out: They could--and did--write letters and
e-mails to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, but only when they cared enough to do so. The labor
and thought that went into those letters helped <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> understand how many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> really cared about an issue and exactly what those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> thought. If
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> truly "trusted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>," he would have left this system alone.
Instead, by simplifying the "voting" process and flooding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> with
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of identical <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-line e-mails, he obliterates the distinction not
just between my opinion on vouchers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bennett</ENAMEX>'s, but also between
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>'s intense interest in the issue and my faint interest in it.

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> defines where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> stand. Vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> "will elevate the dialogue
between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> to a new level," writes
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX>. "When your congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> votes on the issue, we will
e-mail you to tell you how he or she voted. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Right</TIMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">election day</TIMEX>, we'll
send you a report card listing how they voted on all the topics you voted on."
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris</ENAMEX> says the report card will show each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter</ENAMEX> "what percentage of the time
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> agreed with him." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Report</ENAMEX> cards aren't new--they're used by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coalition</ENAMEX> and other interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to reduce complicated issues so
that each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> can be labeled "pro-abortion" or "pro-environment." Report
cards don't transfer power from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>. They transfer power to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">intermediary</ENAMEX> that gets to characterize how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> have voted. If
vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> succeeds, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> will become that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">intermediary</ENAMEX>.

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> controls the special interests. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris</ENAMEX> says vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> "will give us
all a chance to be heard so our voice gets loud enough to drown out the special
interests that run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>." Meanwhile, he predicts that "money won't work in
politics anymore, because you won't be able to reach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> by buying
television ads," since "the Internet is taking the place of television in
politics." So if you're a special interest, where can you take your money to
reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>? To <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morris</ENAMEX>, of course. He boasts that vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> is "free"
because "we get our money from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX>." And who's going to advertise on a
site where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> vote on political issues? Why, special interests, naturally.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> already quotes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFL-CIO</ENAMEX> in the arguments he
summarizes for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>. The more influential these summaries become, the more
each interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> will be willing to pay to get its views and quotes into
them.

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> represents the Internet. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Burke</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British statesman</ENAMEX>, called
journalism the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourth Estate</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">French Revolution</ENAMEX>," recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris</ENAMEX>. "We
think the Internet is replacing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, so we call it the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fifth Estate</ENAMEX>." But
rather than relinquish this catchy title to the whole Internet, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> claims
it for the "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>" (translation: column) he writes on vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. He sees the
power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of the future, and he wants to dominate it. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> ignore or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dismiss Morris</ENAMEX>, he accuses them of ignoring or dismissing the Internet. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, citing technical reasons, has capped the number of e-mails it will
accept from vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX>, in turn, has charged that "the Internet
administration is burning the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 st century</TIMEX>" and is
"discriminating simply because this is over the Internet." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX>, it seems,
has taken his philosophy less from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Robespierre</ENAMEX> than from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louis</ENAMEX> XIV:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">l'Internet</ENAMEX>, c'est moi .

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> controls the voting process. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> constantly describes his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> as "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>" who are engaged in "referenda" through vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. The site
advises them when the "polls" will "close" on each referendum and assures them
afterward that "your vote really counted." Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris</ENAMEX> warns the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> against "censoring" the "views of those who vote" through his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX>, and
he advises <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> who don't accept e-mails that "we'll have to
tell their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> who participate in vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX> referenda that they won't
take e-mail, even from those who elect them." He also promises to crack the
whip on wayward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> by publishing the "referenda results, broken down
by state and congressional district," in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> , a congressional
newspaper. By adopting the language of elections ("vote," "elect," "referenda")
and by encouraging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> to treat vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> as the vehicle
through which the public delivers mandates to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> is trying to
make vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, in effect, the place where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> vote. Vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> would become,
as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> envisions it, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s "town meeting." And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> would run the
meeting.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX>, of course, insists
that vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX> poses no such threat. "It's a ballot box," he says. "It has no
point of view." What a brilliantly innocuous metaphor, devised by a master
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manipulator</ENAMEX> to obscure his manipulations. This, it turns out, is the most
important difference between democracy and dickmorrisy. The only thing worse
than a cacophony of special interests plastering their views all over the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s airwaves and legislation is a single special interest that owns the
ballot box--and knows how to make itself invisible.
