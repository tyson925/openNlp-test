            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">press</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> celebrated the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 th</NUMEX> anniversary of the fall
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Berlin Wall</ENAMEX>. Die
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welt</ENAMEX> led on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> calling it "a happy day for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX>."
The headline in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</ENAMEX> spoke of "emotion and measured
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">joy</ENAMEX>," but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily Telegraph of London</ENAMEX> denied the existence of any joy at all. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> said
that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> marked the event "in an almost gloomy mood, with many Berliners
angry at the dominant role played by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> in the commemoration of what
was a popular uprising." The celebrations at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Brandenburg Gate</ENAMEX>, it added,
"could not obscure the fact that few, if any, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berliners</ENAMEX> tried to recapture the
careless rapture of the event."

            One
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who certainly didn't demonstrate careless rapture was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX>,
who wasn't at the celebration with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX>, and
former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Kohl</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> press debated whether she had
snubbed them or had been snubbed by them. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times of London</ENAMEX> quoted
her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> as saying that she hadn't been "officially approached." <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizers</ENAMEX> of the event told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> had repeatedly been
invited to attend, but she had declined. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> recalled her well-known
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antipathy</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kohl</ENAMEX> and her quiet attempts, with the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fran√</ENAMEX>ßois
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitterrand</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, to stop <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> reunification by encouraging <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> it.

            In an
editorial, Le
Monde of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> had tried to convince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitterrand</ENAMEX> to join
her in open opposition to a united <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, but "the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> was too
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">well-advised</ENAMEX> to directly oppose a movement which had surprised him, which he
mistrusted, and which he may well have feared, but which he also knew to be
inevitable." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Le Monde</ENAMEX> said the German celebrations were conducted "with
a certain modesty, as if to allay the fears that a united <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, not always
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wrongly</ENAMEX>, has traditionally provoked in its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>." But the editorial went
on to laud the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> as "a democracy which has nothing to envy in its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> and even, in many areas, is an example to them." Curiously, given
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>'s resistance to a united <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Le Monde</ENAMEX> said she had
mistakenly feared "that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> of the fall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Berlin Wall</ENAMEX> would
be <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> integration." If that had been so, she would probably have welcomed
it.

            In an
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> published simultaneously in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Independent of London</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Repubblica</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El</ENAMEX>
Pa√≠s of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Garton Ash</ENAMEX> described his
impressions of chairing a debate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kohl</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>. He
said he asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> about his famously understated response to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> news of
the breach in the wall--"I'm very pleased." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> replied that what had been
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uppermost</ENAMEX> in his mind was to ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>'s position in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soviet</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> was not threatened by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> triumphalism. "I didn't want to poke my
finger in his eye," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> explained.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX>
carried an editorial condemning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s bombardment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX>. It called on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX> to speak out more strongly
against the war. "The conflict is a grave embarrassment for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nato</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> said. "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> claims it is simply behaving like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nato</ENAMEX> over
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>. But with every passing day, it appears to be behaving more like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, attacking an entire ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, rather than
defending humanitarian ideals."

            In a
report <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chechen-Ingush</ENAMEX> border, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto Globe and Mail</ENAMEX> said
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> attacks against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chechen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> are happening so frequently and with
such a similar pattern of destruction that aid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> are having
difficulty keeping track of them. As an example, it cited the confusion of a
human rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> when asked about a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> attack that killed or
injured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> as they played <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">soccer</ENAMEX>. "He had just finished interviewing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> who saw an attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">soccer</ENAMEX>-playing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and he wondered if it
was the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> said. "In fact, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate assaults
on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> playing <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">soccer</ENAMEX>."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> Times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>
reported the first crack in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> political solidarity in favor of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechen</ENAMEX> war. It said the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal opposition party</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yabolko</ENAMEX> has called for
immediate peace negotiations, despite the overwhelming support for the war from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> and public opinion. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> have been speculating
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> on the future of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir Putin</ENAMEX>, whose popularity has
risen dramatically because of the war. The papers claim that the West is
pressing for his removal from office. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> Times
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, the paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Komsomolskaya Pravda</ENAMEX> , citing unidentified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kremlin</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX> has already been told by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Yeltsin</ENAMEX>
that he must either resign or end the war and fire the army <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of staff</ENAMEX>.
"The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kremlin</ENAMEX> have made a decision to cease military
activities in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chechnya</ENAMEX>," the paper was quoted as saying.
