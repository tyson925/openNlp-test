            A
cover story argues that it pays to play dumb in politics.
While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> "has the appearance of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who prepared for a spelling bee and
found himself in a swimsuit competition," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>'s apparent "boredom
with the details of governance" is a political asset. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Voters</ENAMEX> are seeking "a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> who will make us proud--and do little else." ‚Ä¶ A cover story traces the similarities between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John F. Kennedy</ENAMEX>. Both were privileged, preppy "reluctant dauphins" to
political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dynasties</ENAMEX>, who caroused and earned C's at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX>. Both relied on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">daddy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>, outspent their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX>, and sought to avenge their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>'
political defeats. ‚Ä¶ An article celebrates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>: Protests
against such minor matters as genetically modified food demonstrate that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">world</ENAMEX> has conquered more critical problems. (

            The cover editorial applauds the establishment of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">power-sharing parliament</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern Ireland</ENAMEX> as providing "a realistic hope for
durable peace." The new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North-South</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX> will appease <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nationalists</ENAMEX>, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX> will reassure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Unionists</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dispersed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> membership, affluence, and secularization could defuse ancient
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">animosities</ENAMEX>. (For more on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern Ireland</ENAMEX>, see ".") ‚Ä¶ A
piece explains how the "open content movement" will
transform the way we work. Open-source projects--such as the operating system
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linux</ENAMEX>--rely on online collaboration to improve. An "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Open Law</ENAMEX>" experiment asks
Web <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surfers</ENAMEX> to contribute arguments to a high-tech legal brief. ‚Ä¶ An
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> recommends the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LifeShirt</ENAMEX>--a turtleneck with
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> built-in medical sensors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LifeShirts</ENAMEX> measure vital signs and relay the
information to palm-sized computers, which download the data for online
diagnosis.

            The
last of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s special millennium issues chronicles the making of a
Times time capsule. It will preserve until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 3000</TIMEX> special
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Magazine</ENAMEX> issues and other soon-to-be-determined
stuff. A piece describes the contending capsule designs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> entrant proposed
encoding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s contents in cockroach <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Another suggested sheathing
the contents in a metal earring for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Statue of Liberty</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> is a
steel origamilike capsule. ‚Ä¶ Several articles try to explain our time to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of the future. A field guide to deceased species informs
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31 st -century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> that global warming killed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gal√</ENAMEX>°pagos
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penguin</ENAMEX> and truffles were "gourmandized to extinction." ‚Ä¶ An
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Encyclopedia of Lost Practices</ENAMEX>" explains that smoking was "the most popular
form of recreational suicide ever devised" and "reproductive sex" was "the
union of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female genitalia resulting (with often stunning rapidity) in
the ejaculation of semen."

            A week
after decrying millennium hype, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> celebrates <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> as the unofficial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">millenniums</ENAMEX>. In the weirdest bit, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> recreates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gospels</ENAMEX>' most
dramatic moments and recounts his own meeting with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of God: He was
suddenly transported to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galilee</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> cured his <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and forgave his
sins. ‚Ä¶ An article examines the glamorization of mathematics. Good
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will Hunting</ENAMEX> and best-selling biographies of celebrated mathematicians have
made math sexy. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This season</TIMEX> there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> books <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about zero</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fendi</ENAMEX> is
peddling a fragrance called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Theorema</ENAMEX>.

            The
Mars cover package says that if the probes landing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> find
frozen surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, it could indicate that liquid water remains in the
planet's warmer interior and that life could exist there. A sidebar notes that controversy remains over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> meteorite
that crashed into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctica</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 11,000 years ago</TIMEX>: While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> have
demolished most of the evidence that the meteorite contained living <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX>,
they cannot explain why the meteorite contains a molecule that on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> is only
produced by biological processes. ‚Ä¶ An excerpt of a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> biography points out that by enlisting
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> all but ensured he would avoid <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> combat, but it
rejects the claim that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> received special treatment or protection. ‚Ä¶
A piece describes the horrific trade in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> boxers. Poor <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> street
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> are brought to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> by unscrupulous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> to serve as
patsies for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> boxers. Several have been severely injured in mismatched
bouts.

movement; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manson</ENAMEX> family rampage , which ended the social experimentation
of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">'60s</NUMEX> on a sour note. Among others: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosenbergs, Son</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.J.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simpson</ENAMEX>. ‚Ä¶ A piece claims <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> are "spiritual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twins</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> prays with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methodist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ministers</ENAMEX> via cell phone. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> is a
born-again <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Baptist</ENAMEX> who regularly invokes biblical verse on the stump. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>

            An
issue devoted to the digital age. An article argues that digital encryption has
neutered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Agency</ENAMEX> by making it virtually impossible for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> to decode <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> transmissions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX> is also hobbled by budget cuts,
brain drain, and shortsighted management. ‚Ä¶ A piece applauds the
overlooked innovations that make e-commerce possible. Shopping online would be
impractical without bar-coding, warehouse automation, and express delivery.

            A
piece argues that there is no evidence of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> smear campaign against
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX>. He has been winning sympathy and good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> because of
allegations that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> are whispering that he's unstable, but
even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> can't produce any actual evidence of smears. ‚Ä¶
A review trashes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>'s ghostwritten
autobiography as perhaps the worst campaign book ever. A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Charge to Keep</ENAMEX>
is banal, disorganized, and packed with platitudes, revealing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> as both
boring and filled with "overweening <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Baby Boomer</ENAMEX> self-regard." (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Read</ENAMEX>
