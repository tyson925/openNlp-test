               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            Many responses <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX> not as a genuine
womanizer, able to exploit his transient sexual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> on his own merits, but
as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pseudo-womanizer</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consorts</ENAMEX> see him as a sort of moon-faced
paycheck.

            But perhaps his sexual
boasting, while delightfully buffoonish, is a minor crime. Rigorous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">self-awareness</ENAMEX> is rarely found in bed where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will tell you just about any
damn thing. It is a setting that conspires against self-knowledge: the soft
lights, the kind words, the shape-flattering diaphanous teddy that, frankly,
wouldn't hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX>'s whole look. But despite the generous spiritedness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News</ENAMEX>
Quiz <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> remains the perfect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Moli√®re fool</ENAMEX>, supremely confident
of his splendor, supremely unaware that to everyone else he's a cartoon, Le
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourgeois Gentilhomme</ENAMEX> with a bad haircut. But big where it counts--in the
wallet.

            
               When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fatuity Turns</ENAMEX>
to Madness Answer
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX> said this about the collapse of the
stock market.

            Apparently, the ongoing
bull market can sustain itself for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more year, right up until the
presidential election, at which time, if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> wins, prosperity continues, but
if he loses, the bottom drops out. In making this prediction to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
Times <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maureen Dowd</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> declined to release details of either
the economic theory or the satanic pact that would make this scenario
possible.

            Which of the following
are actual <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Brown</ENAMEX> rationalizations for her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s slide into darkness
(quoted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Kuczynski</ENAMEX>), and which are amusing
digs at a debased editorial philosophy built around fawning over <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX>?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. "It takes time for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> to establish its
identity."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. "Tough for a print <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> to vie with
Internet's ability to deliver the crass and shallow."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. "All <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gwyneth All The Time</ENAMEX> format less popular
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">than Harvey Weinstein</ENAMEX> promised."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. "It's taken time to organize our approach to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. "Still shifting from old editorial policy of
uncritical worship of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> to new policy of enthusiastic
groveling before <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX>."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. "I should not be absorbed in reading <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> drafts
of an article, which is what I have been doing, which has been my dilemma."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. "I should send an assistant out to buy me one of
those dictionary things and then get someone to look up 'dilemma' for me."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gwyneth</ENAMEX> wouldn't pose with the donkey."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>. "When I saw the success of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> issue, it
was a crazy wonderful thing, but I knew our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> was too small."

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>. "We need to make
news and break news about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gwyneth Paltrow</ENAMEX>, and that means looking for stories
with a lot of journalistic calories. By which I do not mean that Gwyneth
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paltrow</ENAMEX> is fat. She's that other thing. Thin."
