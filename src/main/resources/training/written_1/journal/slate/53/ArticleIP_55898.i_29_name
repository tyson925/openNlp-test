            Not long ago, out of curiosity, I picked up some
exercise videos by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy Blanks</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tae-Bo</ENAMEX>. What a flop. The sets were
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cheesy</ENAMEX>, the music was awful 1980s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">synth-pop</ENAMEX>, and despite their martial-arts
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pretensions</ENAMEX>, the routines felt more like aerobics in disguise than like kung
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fu</ENAMEX>. But after flailing away in my living room for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few nights</TIMEX>, my interest was
piqued, and I decided to find out more about the real thing. Which martial art
teaches good self-defense tactics? Which one would give me a good aerobic
workout? How daunting would it be to jump into a class as a complete beginner?
And would I get pummeled by the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>?

            To find out, I tried a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">karate</ENAMEX>, tae kwon
do, aikido, jujitsu, and kung fu <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> area. I scored each one
in several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>: how intimidating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> would be to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novice</ENAMEX>; how much the
exercises worked my muscles; how much of an I got; whether it would develop
coordination and balance; how much physical contact with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> was
involved; and, of course, its value in self-defense. All ratings are on a scale
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one to five</NUMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> being the hardest, most intimidating, or most
valuable.

            To <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>, this will
look like a hopelessly biased and superficial inquiry. It is. But to beginners,
it is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> step toward figuring out which martial art might be right for you. Do
you want a chance to kick the stuffing out of someone? Take tae kwon do. Do you
want to improve your sense of balance? Take karate. Do you want to know what to
do if someone tries to choke you? Take jujitsu. Just remember that if you're
jumped by a mugger, the only thing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tae-Bo</ENAMEX> will be good for is making your
attacker collapse into uncontrollable fits of laughter.

            In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-levels group I
observed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seven Star Women's Kung Fu</ENAMEX>, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen or so</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> dressed
completely in black. (Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> I took were co-ed.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> wouldn't let
me take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>--I could only watch--but that was better than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple Kung Fu</ENAMEX>,
which made me sit for an interview before they'd even reveal any information on
their classes. There seemed to be an active screening process to keep out those
with only a casual interest.

            After meditating for a
few <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> launched into traditional strengthening exercises
(push-ups and sit-ups) and then broke into pairs, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> kicking pads
held by the other. It looked to be decent strength training. Their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> got a
good workout from the push-ups and punching; abs, from the sit-ups; and the
lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, from the kicking. It was not extreme, and nobody seemed
exhausted.

            After the strength work

and repeated choreographed routines called "kata ," which involve a
series of punches, kicks, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> with an imaginary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foe</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> had
broken into a light sweat, but was not gasping for air.

            The moves were neat to

would be difficult to apply the drills in real life.

            This rating is a little
misleading. The lower-body strength workout was fantastic--my legs and hips
were sore for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>--but there was almost no strength training for the upper
body. We used our arms only for balance and blocking kicks.

            We began with everyone
standing in lines and kicking into the air. Then we did a long series of
running drills up and down the mats. Then there was more kicking: Turning
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kicks</ENAMEX>, straight kicks, low kicks, kicks with punching bags, kicks with partners
â€¦ the list goes on. It was an excellent workout.

            Learning how to make
contact with the pad (and not, say, the face of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> holding it) was
important. Balance was crucial in the sparring.

a session of sparring (which I, alas, was not allowed to participate in). The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> strapped on protective chest pads and helmets and began kicking the
stuffing out of each other.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">downstairs</ENAMEX> do." This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> was approachable and open. And karate's so familiar
