            Among the single digits,
no number is less evocative than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>. Consider movie titles. Run up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>

after news that her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> will soon be extended--to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirror</ENAMEX>
left rivals floundering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> when we broke the news that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Premier</ENAMEX> and

            The story continues:

            "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bookies</ENAMEX> entered into the spirit of things by
jokingly offering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500-to-1</NUMEX> odds against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> being

a bouquet from our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>. She paused outside <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">10 Downing Street</ENAMEX>, and smiled:
'Thank you, I'm very well thank you.'

            "Of her reaction to the

"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cartoon</ENAMEX>" issue features a wacky contest: Write a caption for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Ziegler</ENAMEX>
drawing of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> on her front porch shouting something about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in the
suit struggling up the path with a huge globe on his shoulders. (For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>
who have never seen a cartoon and don't know how a caption works, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>
explain that "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> forgot the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza</ENAMEX>!" would be one possibility.)

               Looks like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> gave the wrong final answer!

               OK, maybe the world is enough.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mom</ENAMEX>, this probably isn't <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a good day</TIMEX> to leave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Seinfeld</ENAMEX>.
