            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX>, that most enigmatic of all--well, what is
it? A game? TV show? Toy?--claims the Top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> spots on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> video games
chart. It is the top-rated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>' TV show; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than 50 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> game
cards have been sold; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> is hosting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 5,000</NUMEX> auctions for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√</ENAMEX>©mon
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cards; Burger King</ENAMEX> is distributing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> toys over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56 days</TIMEX>--expect chaos
at the drive-thru. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Movie</ENAMEX> , which opened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>,
will rule the fall box office. When a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> radio station announced a
contest for free movie tickets, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70,000</NUMEX> calls a minute overwhelmed the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">switchboard</ENAMEX>. Pok√©mon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">creator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nintendo</ENAMEX> and its licensees will make <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 billion</NUMEX> in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7 billion</NUMEX> worldwide.

            In the happy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> dolls are
chucked into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toys</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>" Us remainder bins with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trolls, Pogs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ninja</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Turtles</ENAMEX>, let us pause to reflect on the lesson of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√</ENAMEX>©mon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX>: This
money could have been yours.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, anyone could
have known that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> was coming. This is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iron Law of Preteen Manias</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every four years</TIMEX>--every <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX>generation--an entirely predictable entertainment
phenomenon enthralls <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transformers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-'80s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Teenage</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mutant Ninja Turtles</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early '90s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</ENAMEX> in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-'90s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√</ENAMEX>©mon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.

            These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">phenoms</ENAMEX> invade from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>--or, in the case of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ninja Turtles</ENAMEX>, might as well have. They are premised on the notion that some
mysterious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> can alter the ordinary into the extraordinary. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kids</ENAMEX>,
especially <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-12-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>, strongly identify with the changing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>,
imagining themselves as suddenly potent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transformers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Turtles</ENAMEX>, or Power
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rangers</ENAMEX>. With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> , they become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> of the evolving, growing
Pok√©mon monsters. These games/toys/shows present <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> with a world they can
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>--a world where the little guy becomes conqueror, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> (or their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proxies</ENAMEX>) defeat evil, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are essentially absent. These entertainments,
in short, serve as practice for growing up, preparation for the trek through
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adolescence</ENAMEX>.

            Pok√©mon outclasses its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">predecessors</ENAMEX> in every way. Introduced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> as a video game in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, it now
features a card game, several video games, a TV cartoon, and endless related
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foods</ENAMEX>, books, posters, toys. (The cartoon made headlines in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1997</TIMEX> when
its flashing lights sent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 700</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> into convulsions.) The
games and show arrived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> and became wildly
popular almost immediately. They are a triumph of cross-marketing. The TV show
essentially advertises the games, which pushes sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©gear.</ENAMEX>

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX>, you play a "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trainer</ENAMEX>" of "pocket
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monsters</ENAMEX>"--cute, curious <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> with magical powers. The most famous Pok√©mon
is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pikachu</ENAMEX> ( Gesundheit! ), a delightful little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">yellow mouse</ENAMEX> that shocks
with its electric tail. Butterfree blows "stun spores" with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterfly</ENAMEX>
wings. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bulbasaur</ENAMEX> is a squat blue <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaur</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> on its back. Other
Pok√©mon are similarly odd. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX>  for more about the cleverness of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monsters</ENAMEX>.) With care and training, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√</ENAMEX>©mon can "evolve" into more powerful
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX>. Pikachu, for example, evolves into the thunderous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raichu</ENAMEX>. (Pok√©mon
may be the only way to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>.) As zookeepers for this freakish
menagerie, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are supposed to collect all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">151 Pok√©mon</ENAMEX>, store them in little
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pok√©balls</ENAMEX>, and use them to fight other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon.</ENAMEX>

            Pok√©mon combines the best elements of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>
fads including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Beanie Babies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tamagochi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ninja Turtles</ENAMEX>. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Beanie Babies</ENAMEX>,
Pok√©mon exploits <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>' instinct to collect. From <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> cards to dolls to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stamps</ENAMEX>, preteens are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors</ENAMEX> by nature: They are learning to recognize
patterns and organize their world. Pok√©mon allows them to indulge this in the
most elaborate way. The motto of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√</ENAMEX>©mon is "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gotta</ENAMEX> catch 'em all." You have to
get every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> card and play the video games till you capture all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">151</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ninja Turtles</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Power Rangers</ENAMEX> lacked this collecting aspect.) This
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acquisitiveness</ENAMEX> has turned <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> into an economics lesson: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kids</ENAMEX> spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bartering</ENAMEX> cards and figuring out what exactly a particular Pok√©mon is
worth.

            Pok√©mon marries
collecting to pop cultural obsession, catering to the interests of preteen
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>. There are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaur</ENAMEX>, snake, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dragon Pok√©mon</ENAMEX>. Several were created by
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> experiments gone awry. Some practice martial arts. One is made out of
computer code (don't ask).

            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> softens its violence with sweetness. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ninja</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Turtles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Power Rangers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√</ENAMEX>©mon is packed with battle scenes. But it is far
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gentler</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> never die, they only "faint." They are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">warriors</ENAMEX>, but they are
also darling. "They are cute fuzzy things, but they are also really violent.
That is incredibly appealing to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Linn</ENAMEX>,
associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media Center of Judge Baker Children's Center</ENAMEX>.
Pok√©mon plagiarizes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tamagochi</ENAMEX>, the nurturing game that so entranced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> demands that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> learn to care for their charges, educate and
"evolve" them, and take them to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> when they are hurt.

            What differentiates
Pok√©mon from other phenoms is that it merges a TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">franchise</ENAMEX> with a compelling
game. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Transformers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Turtles</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rangers</ENAMEX> were largely confined to action
figures and television. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX>, by contrast, centers on an intellectually
demanding game. (It may resemble <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Dungeons & Dragons</ENAMEX> more than any toy fad.)
Pok√©mon creates an entire alternate universe, a land with its own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>,
ecosystem, and rules. It is essentially a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX>-level version of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">rock</ENAMEX>-paper-scissors. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> has its own skills that work better against
some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√</ENAMEX>©mon than others. Trainers calculate how their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX>'s talents match
against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX>, a fiendishly complicated task that requires mastering and
manipulating information about every monster--a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">151</NUMEX>-variable algebra problem.
Can a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sandshrew</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> in ground fighting, beat a water Pok√©mon like the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poliwhirl</ENAMEX>? Can a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pikachu</ENAMEX> defeat an evolved <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raichu</ENAMEX>? (Yes, if it uses speed
attacks rather than electrical ones.) Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, delighted by the game's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexity</ENAMEX>, have taken up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon.</ENAMEX> No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> ever played with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ninja</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Turtles</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Power Rangers</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> has caused the expected consternation among parents
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">educators</ENAMEX>. Its emphasis on acquisitiveness annoys <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who find
themselves buying pack after pack of new cards. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> has been banned in
countless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> won't stop trading cards. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> find
themselves intervening to stop their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> from making bad deals with
unscrupulous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> claim Pok√©mon is literally addicting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. A
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> just filed a class-action suit against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> card
manufacturer alleging that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√</ENAMEX>©mon is illegal gambling. By <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seeding</ENAMEX> packs with a
few high-value cards, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> is encouraging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> cards
like lottery tickets. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kids</ENAMEX> buy again and again in hopes of finding that rare
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">holographic Pikachu</ENAMEX>.

            TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">watchdogs</ENAMEX> complain
about the cartoon's violence. (The TV show, it must be said, is far less
interesting and sophisticated than the games.) And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> has spawned the
usual fundamentalist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protests</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preacher</ENAMEX> made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congregation</ENAMEX> watch as he torched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> cards and chopped a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> toy with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sword</ENAMEX>.

            But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> can rest assured that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√</ENAMEX>©mon won't last. The
market will saturate. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kids</ENAMEX> will tire of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">151</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> and even the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> new
ones on the way from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>. Sure as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Backstreet Boys</ENAMEX> will meet a bad end,
you can be certain that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√</ENAMEX>©mon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> will age out of the game and
into sullen teendom. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> that follows will find its own craze. This
is too bad, because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√</ENAMEX>©mon is undoubtedly much smarter and more charming than
what will supplant it.

            Still, the inevitable death of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√</ENAMEX>©mon presents us
with the opportunity to create the replacement phenom and cash in on it. What
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transforming</ENAMEX>, magical game/toy/show will delight the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8-year-olds</TIMEX> of the future?
I've got it! The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netosaurs</ENAMEX>: A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaurs</ENAMEX> that travel through the World
Wide Web fighting viruses and eating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spam</ENAMEX>.
