               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            Many responses were
built on the assumption that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Baptists</ENAMEX> are bad in bed. Certainly, some
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">religious groups</ENAMEX> associate sex with sin, which can either be inhibiting or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inspiring</ENAMEX>, depending on your point of view (and whether or not you own your own
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vestments</ENAMEX>). Still other faiths forbid specific erotic acts, such as getting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undressed</ENAMEX> or smiling. Of course, sexual pleasure is not experienced in groups
(unless you are very lucky), but between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of whom
should be awake at the time, praying for forgiveness). And so there is no proof
that any particular religion is sexier than any other. There is, however, some
evidence that sexual satisfaction correlates with educational attainment; for
instance, those who completed graduate school express greater sexual happiness
than those who dropped out of high school. You'd think this sort of thing would
show up in more educational reform plans. But not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX>'s. (Praise the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lord</ENAMEX>.)

Answer
            

            "Show me a single case where a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern Baptist</ENAMEX> has
acted deceptively ."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rev. Patterson</ENAMEX> was commenting on a letter from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish Community Relations Council</ENAMEX>, an umbrella <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 60</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>, protesting his denomination's use of "deceptive" tactics to
convert <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX>, including--in a rare show of unity--the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seminaries</ENAMEX>, are particularly vexed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baptists</ENAMEX>'
use of tallis and yarmulke in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>.

            "Our quarrel with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Baptist Convention</ENAMEX>
is not over its right to proselytize," said the letter. "Rather, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> is deeply offended that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S.B.C.</ENAMEX> has formally embraced a strategy
that attempts to deceive <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> into believing that one can be both a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX> and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX>."

            That <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S.B.C.</ENAMEX> employs a
very different conversion tactic than the straightforward hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lead enema</ENAMEX> used
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Inquisition</ENAMEX> to convert <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, sometimes turning them into "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maranos</ENAMEX>," or
secret <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, other times into "pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>," or dead <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>.

mentally ill do things that harm others; he proposes to change the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in office, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pataki</ENAMEX> financed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> new housing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>; there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10,000</NUMEX>
