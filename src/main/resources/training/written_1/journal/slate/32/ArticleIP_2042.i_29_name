            Premarital agreements are
rare. This observation used to dismay the late <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laureate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Stigler</ENAMEX>:
He maintained that the grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> of matrimony is demeaned by those who
can't be bothered to negotiate its details.

            A
marriage is a contract. You can write that contract yourself (in which case
it's called a "premarital agreement"), or you can accept the default contract
written by your state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX>. Now comes the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX>, determined
to expand its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>' options. Henceforth, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louisianians</ENAMEX> will be able to
choose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between two</NUMEX> prefabricated contracts, each with very different
provisions for divorce. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> option is similar to the no-fault contract
that is standard in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>--the so-called "covenant
marriage"--makes divorce far more difficult.

            Even if you never divorce, your choice among contracts can
affect the entire course of your marriage. That's because the
possibility of divorce alters your incentives to keep your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> happy
(and vice versa). Of course, you might want to keep your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> happy for other
reasons, the most notable of which is love. Sometimes, love is all you need.
But because we're talking about divorce law, I want to focus on cases where
love is not enough--and in those cases, to ask which contract provides the best
incentive for good marital behavior. The answer may not be what you think.

            While
we're at it, let's compare <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> kinds of marriage: a no-fault contract
(where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">either party</ENAMEX> can obtain a divorce on demand), a mutual-consent contract
(where both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> must agree to a divorce), and a covenant marriage (where
even mutual consent is not enough). You might think that no-fault marriages are
always the most likely to end in divorce. That isn't true, and here's one
reason why: A lot of marital issues are negotiable--like who should do the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dishes</ENAMEX>, who gets to operate the remote control, which one wears the anti-snore
device and which one wears the earplugs, and so on. Here the negotiating
process itself provides all the right incentives to respect your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX>'s
needs. What you won't do for love, you'll still do for a bribe. And those
things you won't do even for a bribe are, presumably, sufficiently distasteful
that you shouldn't do them.

            
Bribery works equally well under no-fault and
mutual consent (though the choice of contract alters the balance of power and
therefore might alter the size of the bribes). Under either system, the
marriage survives as long as it's possible to keep both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> happier
together than they would be apart. Therefore, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> systems produce the same
number of divorces. (If you're not convinced by that argument--which is a
special case of a general principle that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> call the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coase</ENAMEX> theorem,
click for an illustrative numerical example.)

            On the
other hand, if you're in a covenant marriage--where you can't get a divorce
even by mutual consent--divorce might be impossible even when the marriage
turns bad for both of you. If we assume that all marital conflicts are
negotiable, the covenant marriage has no offsetting advantages: It keeps
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> together only in those cases where they'd both be happier apart.

            The analysis changes if there are important decisions that
can't be negotiated, like the decision whether to bring home a surprise
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bouquet</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. Chronic thoughtlessness on such matters can cause a
marriage to deteriorate. The knowledge that divorce is impossible might make
you strive harder to avoid such deterioration--and it might do the same for
your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX>. In that sense, a covenant marriage is like the old nuclear-war
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doomsday Machine</ENAMEX>: You are each on notice that you'd better work hard to
preserve a good marriage, or you'll both be forced to live your lives in a bad
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doomsday Machines</ENAMEX> can be very effective. But sometimes they blow up. So
the covenant marriage is a mixed blessing.

            It's the
issues you can't negotiate that make the covenant marriage worth considering.
But that same inability can make no-fault marriages the strongest of all. In a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">no-fault</ENAMEX> marriage, a happy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> will treat you well to prevent your leaving.
That gives you an incentive to keep your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> happy. And this process feeds
on itself: Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> works to make you happy, which makes you want to
preserve the marriage, which makes you work to make your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> happy, which
makes your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> want to preserve the marriage, and so on, in a great virtuous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circle</ENAMEX>.

            
By contrast, if divorce required mutual
consent, your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> could accept your efforts to make him or her happy without
feeling a strong need to reciprocate. This prospect discourages you from
bearing gifts in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place. But when either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> has the power to end
the marriage, kindness tends to be repaid with kindness, and therefore kindness
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thrives</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX>, once again, that this analysis applies only to surprise
efforts. Efforts that are negotiated in advance can be negotiated equally well
under any contract.

            So here is the bottom line:
When marital issues are negotiable, we are in the domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coase</ENAMEX> theorem,
where no-fault and mutual consent do equally well and where covenant marriage
is always a mistake. But when important issues can't be negotiated, both the
covenant marriage and the no-fault contract become more attractive, for
different reasons.

            This analysis is far from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exhaustive</ENAMEX>, and I know from much recent experience that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> will
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">forcefully</ENAMEX> call my attention to scenarios I've failed to consider. Let me
pre-empt them and go a step further by pointing out a basic question I've
ignored: How does a change in the marriage contract affect a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX>'s decision
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> whether to get married in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place? There's a lot of interesting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">economics</ENAMEX> in that question, and if I manage to sort it out, I'll let you
know.
