            At the risk of sounding
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grandiose</ENAMEX>, I hereby declare myself to be involved in a bitter feud with no less
a personage than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Jay Gould</ENAMEX>. It all started in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, when I reviewed his
book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wonderful</ENAMEX> 
               Life for the New 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX> . I argued,
basically, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> is a fraud. He has convinced the public that he is not
merely a great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, but a great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorist</ENAMEX> of evolution. Yet, among top-flight
evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> is considered a pest--not just a lightweight,
but an actively muddled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who has warped the public's understanding of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darwinism</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alas</ENAMEX>, paid me no mind. No testy letter to the New 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX> ,
nothing. I heard through the grapevine that he was riled. But, savvy alpha male
that he is, he refrained from getting into a gutter brawl with a scrawny,
marginal <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">primate</ENAMEX> such as myself. Then, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>, my big moment finally
arrived. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX>'s long-repressed contempt burst forth from the reptilian core of
his brain and leapt over the fire walls in his frontal lobes. In an essay in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural</ENAMEX> 
               History <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, while dismissing evolutionary
psychology as "pop science," he called my book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The</ENAMEX> 
               Moral

               Animal "the most noted and most absurd example."

            It is, of course, beneath my dignity to respond to this
personally motivated attack (except to note that if you think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Jay Gould</ENAMEX>
actually deigned to read my puny book, you must be getting him mixed up with
someone whose time is less precious). Instead, I will use the occasion of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX>'s essay to make a major contribution to Western thought. And actually,
come to think of it, making this contribution will entail responding to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX>'s
personally motivated attack. We'll start with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> and get to Western thought
later.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural</ENAMEX> 
               History essay, in keeping with his long tradition of
taking courageous political stands, argues against genocide. Its final lines
are: "It need not be. We can do otherwise." You may ask, "Where's the news
value in noting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can refrain from committing genocide<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>" Well, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gould</ENAMEX>
spent the previous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half-dozen</NUMEX> paragraphs cultivating the impression that some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think genocide is hard-wired into our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.

            
Who are these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>? Good question. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gould</ENAMEX>
doesn't name names. Instead, just when you're starting to wonder who exactly is
making this ridiculous claim, he changes the subject to an allegedly analogous
example of biological determinism: currently popular <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> ideas about male
and female psychology. Here he can name names--or, at least, one name. That's
where I come in.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gould</ENAMEX>
begins by distorting a basic evolutionary psychology argument: that because men
can reproduce more often and more easily than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, natural selection (which
favors traits conducive to genetic proliferation) has made the minds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> different. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> puts the posited difference this way: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women</ENAMEX>, in theory,
"should act in such a way as to encourage male investment after impregnation
(protection, feeding, economic wealth, and subsequent child care), whereas men
would rather wander right off in search of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mates</ENAMEX> in a never-ending quest
for maximal genetic spread." The "wander right off" part is wrong. Evolutionary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX> classify our species as having "high male parental investment."
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> are naturally inclined to fall in love with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, stay with them through
pregnancy, and fall in love with the endearing little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> of genetic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> that roll out of the womb.

            To be sure, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> may be tempted to philander on the side,
even to fall in love with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>; they are more inclined than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to
both infidelity and polygamy. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> do have a penchant for cheating or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">straying</ENAMEX>, but under a narrower range of circumstances.) Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> find it
easier to have sex without emotional attachment, so they do sometimes
want to "wander right off" after sex. Still, the fact that evolutionary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX> don't view desertion as standard male procedure vaporizes what
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> considers one of his killer arguments: "Any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who has fiercely loved
his little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>--including most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>, I trust--knows that no siren song
from distinctive[ly male] <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> can overcome this drive for
nurturing behavior shared with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>." If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> knew the first
thing about evolutionary psychology (if he had, say, read my book), he'd know
that this "drive for nurturing behavior" isn't some news flash to evolutionary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX>. It is central to their view of the tensions within male sexual
psychology.

            More
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">noteworthy than Gould</ENAMEX>'s warping of evolutionary psychology is that he actually
embraces some of its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">premises</ENAMEX>. On sex differences: "I don't ... think that the
basic argument is wrong. Such differences in behavioral strategy do make
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> sense." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hmm</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> has denounced evolutionary psychology for years
without (to my knowledge) making such concessions. Now, as it gains support
within both biology and psychology, he seems to be staging a strategic retreat.
But, of course, he can't be seen retreating. He must, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, still manage
to depict evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX> as simpletons. What to do? Create
confusion.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> informs us that the sexual strategies of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are mere "capacities, not requirements or even determining
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">propensities</ENAMEX>." Now, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all, a truly determining propensity
is a requirement. So <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX>, without conspicuously positing a simplistic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dichotomy</ENAMEX>, has posited a simplistic dichotomy: Every behavior--infidelity,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">genocide</ENAMEX>, whatever--is either a mere "capacity" or an "inevitability."
Evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> suggests, tend to take the "inevitability"
view, while a more discerning interpretation of biology (his) takes the
"capacity" view.

            Let's not dwell on the sheer
dishonesty of insinuating that I, or any serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> on evolutionary
psychology, believe infidelity or genocide or anything else is rendered
inevitable genetically. (Well, OK, let's dwell briefly. There.) The key point
is this: Isn't the range of alternatives to inevitability too broad to cram
under the single heading of "capacity"? Do I just have the "capacity" to eat
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">doughnuts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hamburgers</ENAMEX> and broccoli? No. Unfortunately, it's more complicated
than that. I almost always feel a very strong attraction to doughnuts. To
hamburgers I feel a fairly strong attraction under most circumstances. For
broccoli I can muster mild enthusiasm if I'm feeling hungry or guilty. All
these attractions can be bridled, but the amount and nature of the necessary
effort differs by food type and by circumstance.

            I concede that my inner
turmoil over doughnuts is not of great moment. But let's get back to things
like infidelity, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s desertion of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, or even genocide. If we can
learn something about how the underlying emotions wax and wane, about the
circumstances under which bad things are likely to happen, wouldn't that be
useful information? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amazingly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> suggests not. After saying "we learn
nothing" from current <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> theorizing about any "darkness" in human
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nature</ENAMEX>, he continues, "At the very most, biology might help us to delimit the
environmental circumstances that tend to elicit one behavior rather than the
other."

            At the
very most? Delimiting those circumstances is the central aspiration of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 th -century</TIMEX> psychology! So, even if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freud</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> had wholly
succeeded in explaining how upbringing and social experience shape us, it all
would have been a waste of time? Too bad they didn't have a luminary like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gould</ENAMEX>
to explain that to them. I've heard many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criticisms</ENAMEX> of evolutionary psychology,
but this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time I've heard anyone dismiss it by saying that all it
can do is find the Holy Grail of behavioral science.

            Obviously, evolutionary psychology hasn't yet come close to
finding the Holy Grail. But, it has provoked ideas about the role of
environment that, if confirmed by further study, can inform moral discourse and
public policy. For example, I've argued from ev-psych <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">premises</ENAMEX> that extreme
inequality of income, all other things being equal, tends to raise the divorce
rate. This claim may turn out to be wrong, but, contrary to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX>'s basic
indictment of evolutionary psychology, it is neither obvious nor, if true,
useless.

            I grant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> that evolutionary psychology hasn't taught us much about genocide that we
didn't already know. So far, its main contribution is to illuminate not epic
enmity, but the everyday, subtle kind. For example: I just referred to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX>'s
"dishonesty" in misrepresenting my views, but maybe the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dishonesty</ENAMEX> isn't
conscious. Once I wrote that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> review, I became a threat to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX>'s social
status, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>. According to evolutionary psychology, it then became hard for
him to objectively appraise anything I've written (though I suppose actually
reading it would have been a start). Tactically caricaturing my beliefs became
an essentially unconscious process.

            
Similarly, now that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> has attacked me, I
have trouble being objective about him. My radar readily picks up, even
magnifies, his distortions and confusions, but is less sensitive to my own
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">missteps</ENAMEX>. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> will contact <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> and invite him to have an
online debate with me, during which the truth can emerge from dueling
egocentric biases. I predict <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> will ignore the invitation, reverting to a
risk-averse alpha-male strategy.) Anyway, the point is just that we are all, by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nature</ENAMEX>, deeply and unconsciously self-serving in our judgments of others. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gould</ENAMEX>
and I are convinced of each other's confusion, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hutus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tutsis</ENAMEX>, long
before the slaughter began, were convinced of each other's treachery.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> big problem with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX>'s
simplistic capacity/necessity dichotomy is the way it obscures this commonality
between us and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hutus</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> (in another sign of strategic retreat) concedes
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have a biologically based "capacity" to view <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> as "beyond
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fellowship</ENAMEX> and ripe for slaughter." But that makes it sound as if most of us
are entirely civil human beings, while occasionally--in some remote part of the
world--a "genocide" switch gets flicked, and slaughter happens. Those <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> and
Hutus may act like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, but we <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have kept our "capacity" for evil
turned off.

            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>, presumably,
had a similarly high opinion of themselves in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1930s</TIMEX>, and no doubt
such blithe self-regard lubricates descent. OK, OK--I won't get carried away.
I'm not saying <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are on a slippery slope toward genocide, and that only
evolutionary psychology can save <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>. My point is just that (here comes my
contribution to Western thought) evolutionary psychology needn't, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gould</ENAMEX>
fears, be used to excuse evildoers as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of biology. It can actually serve
humanity by making it harder for any of us to casually assume our own goodness.
It says we all warrant skeptical self-scrutiny, and it warns us that this
scrutiny, being unnatural, is very hard. But it also suggests that the effort
is needed. If you sit around waiting for some switch to get flicked, you'll
have waited too long.
