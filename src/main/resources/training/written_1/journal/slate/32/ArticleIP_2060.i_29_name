            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 30, 1997</TIMEX>

            Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P's</ENAMEX>,

            I'm so glad you enjoyed your
stay on the island. We were delighted to arrive after our long trip yesterday
and find everything in such fine shape. It is always such a pleasure--after the
fuss with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>, the baggage, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">groceries</ENAMEX>--to walk the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">porches</ENAMEX>, and to
watch the sun set behind the lighthouse to the west, the moon rise from the
tinted sea to the east, the water darken and cap with white in the south. Of
course, you probably didn't spend much time on the deck looking south because
of the smell from the garbage cans.

            Well, they're all clean now,
though it did take some scrubbing. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Next year</TIMEX> I must make sure to leave you a
larger supply of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">39-gallon</NUMEX> can liners. I know I've left you notes about the
others being too small, which means the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lobster shells</ENAMEX> and fish <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juices</ENAMEX> spill
over and mix with the chewing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pasta</ENAMEX> in the bottom of the can. You can
buy the liners right in the harbor at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarket</ENAMEX>, though I suppose it is
easier to grab the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30-gallon</NUMEX> size. And with all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> you have while
you're here, I'm sure time must be at a premium!

            I did find a minute to relax
in a rocker on the porch <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX>, to watch the seabirds and admire what's
left of the garden. (It's amazing what a little watering will do for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> in a dry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> like this one.) Unfortunately, I didn't realize until
it was too late that one of the spokes holding the left rocker had come loose,
and that someone had tossed it away. (You know, it's really easy to reglue that
sort of thing before the whole frame collapses and the rattan tears--but I
suppose it does make handy kindling. I noticed there were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a couple of</NUMEX>
beads of the carving left when I cleaned the fireplace.) But I didn't really
hurt myself--one always picks up a few bumps and scrapes around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>.

            Many
thanks for the bottles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>. I can see from all the empty cartons that you
must have enjoyed it too. Hope you're having a great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>'s end.

            As ever, etc.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 31, 1997</TIMEX>

            Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P's</ENAMEX>,

            It struck me this morning
that you can see <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from every window of the cottage. I noticed this as I
was moving the furniture on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> floor back into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX>. It's easy
to sort out--as you've probably noticed, when restoring the paint on all the
old pieces, I color-matched them to the bedspreads and rugs. Oh, and don't
worry, I did finally find all the rugs. No doubt they'll dry out in time and be
as good as new. You know, it's not a bad idea to close the windows when it
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rains</ENAMEX>.

            Oh say, I
don't want to be intrusive, but if your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> do get into another knife fight
or whatever, it's really easy to get the blood splatters out of the white
frilled curtains if you wash them in cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> right away. (You can just throw
them in the washing machine, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>' sandy clothes haven't stripped the
gears yet.)

            All the best, etc.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 3, 1997</TIMEX>

            Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P's</ENAMEX>,

            I just thought I'd drop
another line to remind you for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> that the cottage is made of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>. The
shingles, the tongue-in-groove paneling, the polished-pine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> are all old
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wood</ENAMEX>. That means they burn very easily. So: Do not lean the pleated shade on
the bedside lamp against the bulb while it is lighted. As you have no doubt
noticed after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> such experiments in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">consecutive years</TIMEX>, when you do that, the
shade melts and finally burns. Left long enough, the burning shade will set the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> on fire. I assume you leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> when you conduct these little
trials, but there is always the chance that someone else may have lingered.

            By the way, if you think of
it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>, don't let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> remove the front legs of the pedestal sink in
the east <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX> and fill them with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Q-Tips</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are so imaginative these
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>! And if they must do it, try not to discard the peculiar bolt fittings, so
that I can put them back--they don't make that kind of sink anymore, so parts
are hard to find. Ditto the handles on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureau</ENAMEX> drawers. I know they are old
and can come unscrewed. But the nut will always fall inside the drawer, so all
you have to do is thread it back on the screw and then tighten it. Well, I
suppose that's a bother on a vacation, but wouldn't it be just as easy to put
the whole thing inside the drawer as in the wastebasket? Speaking of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">screwing</ENAMEX>--no, no, I'm not concerned about the mattresses--but did anyone ever
show you how to replace a light bulb? There are lots of brand new ones in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sideboard</ENAMEX> in the dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, and I would have thought you'd find it
inconvenient to read or wash dishes in the dark.

            And, speaking of washing
dishes in the dark, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> you brought with you <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> must be a
great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chef</ENAMEX>. Of course, great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cooks</ENAMEX> don't usually make great cleaners. But not
to worry, I'll get the grease off the pots and pans before we close the house
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX>. What a good thing, though, that I happened to look under the
cast iron stove while searching for the corkscrew. Otherwise I'd never have
found the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> bags of garlic and onions. They'll help fill up the composter,
which is really very empty after such a busy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>--I guess you didn't have
time to mind all those recycling rules posted at the town hall.

            Well,
have a great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>, etc.

            P.S. The mail just came.
How thoughtful of you to have paid the rent a whole year in advance. And the
timing couldn't be better, as I've just got the bills for the taxes and
insurance and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> and conservation society appeals and the
down payment on the roof re-shingling. I always tell myself how lucky I am to
have such wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX>.
