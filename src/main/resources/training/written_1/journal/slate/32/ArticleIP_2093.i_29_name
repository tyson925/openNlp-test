            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institute</ENAMEX> on
Drug Abuse concludes every press release on its Web site with the boast that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NIDA</ENAMEX> supports <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 85 percent</NUMEX> of the world's research on the health
aspects of drug abuse and addiction, and publicizes the results of that
research.

            That the
government's drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> for most health studies on drug
abuse--and that they aggressively peddle these studies--doesn't make the
studies automatically suspect. In fact, the science behind NIDA-funded studies
is reputable <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.99 percent</NUMEX> of the time. But what is suspect is the spin
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIDA</ENAMEX> routinely applies to its sponsored studies, such as the successful
flackery that accompanied the marijuana study that appeared in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 27</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edition of Science</ENAMEX> .

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX> paper--"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Activation</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Corticotropin-Releasing Factor</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limbic System</ENAMEX> During <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cannabinoid</ENAMEX>
Withdrawal"--suggest in their conclusion that marijuana may be as addictive as
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>, and that pot's "subtle disruption" of brain chemistry may
leave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> " 'primed' for further disruption by other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> of abuse."

            Both the New York
Times and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> published pieces based on the
NIDA-sponsored study. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> sentence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> story is
indistinguishable from that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIDA</ENAMEX> press release.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> : "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> who
regularly smoke large amounts of marijuana may experience changes in their
brain chemistry that are identical to changes seen in the brains of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who
abuse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>, amphetamines, nicotine and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> have
found."

            NIDA: "Long-term use of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marijuana</ENAMEX> produces changes in the brain that are similar to those seen after
long term use of other major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> of abuse such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>."

            Although
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> 's lead was more original, it, too, followed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIDA</ENAMEX> line.
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marijuana</ENAMEX> may be a far more insidious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> than generally thought," the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> reported, "and apparently alters the brain chemistry of pot smokers
in ways that may make them particularly vulnerable to 'hard' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have found."

            
How seriously should we take these findings? In
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> study, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> injected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> with cannabinoids--<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> that act like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">THC</ENAMEX>, the main active ingredient in marijuana--for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, habituating them to
the compounds. Because cannabinoids can linger in the system for some time, few
marijuana <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> experience anything approximating physical withdrawal if they
stop smoking. To mimic cold-turkey withdrawal, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> then injected
these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">habituated rats</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> that "blocks" the effects of all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cannabinoids</ENAMEX>. Following the injection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> observed
an increase of the brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical CRF</ENAMEX> in the amygdala, a portion of the brain
involved with the emotions of fear and aggression. The presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRF</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amygdala</ENAMEX> is associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX>. Withdrawal from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> also increases <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRF</ENAMEX> in the amygdala. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of the
paper lean on these findings to suggest that marijuana acts on the brain as
other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> of abuse do, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> who stop smoking marijuana might
indulge in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> to stave off the unpleasantness of
increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRF</ENAMEX> in the amygdala.

            A (not
financed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIDA</ENAMEX>) that also appeared in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 27</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX> , and which
was also mentioned in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> articles, further
investigates the effects of cannabinoids on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. The study found an increase
of the neurotransmitter dopamine in rats' nucleus accumbens--often termed "the
pleasure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of the brain"--following several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cannabinoid</ENAMEX> injections. Most
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recreational drugs</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, and nicotine, increase
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dopamine</ENAMEX> in the accumbens. While recognizing that other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have tried
and failed to induce an increase of dopamine in the accumbens by injecting
cannabinoids, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> use their results to suggest that marijuana is more
like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> than was previously thought.

            Before going any further, consider <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> points. First,
injected cannabinoids may not mirror the effects of smoked marijuana. There are
several other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> in marijuana that may modify the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">THC</ENAMEX> alone,
and smoking a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> is a different experience from injecting it. (Imagine the
difference between smoking a cigarette and injecting pure nicotine directly
into a vein.)

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> are not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>.
This does not mean cannabinoid research on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX> is worthless. But there are
several pharmacological and social differences that reduce the relevance of rat
research to social policy. And since the pleasure derived from smoking
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marijuana</ENAMEX> is a core issue, consider <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> point: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rats</ENAMEX> don't like pot.

            I know
this firsthand from my on cannabinoids and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. Initially, I felt guilty about
drugging <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> and then killing them for the necessary dissection. "At least
they're getting stoned <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>," I rationalized. Then I realized that being
stoned means very different things to rats and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marijuana</ENAMEX> makes rats
slothful, and they excrete all over themselves. Before the injection they're
quite friendly--these are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lab animals</ENAMEX>, remember, not hardened street <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>.
After the injection they--honestly--seem rather depressed.

            
Another fun fact about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> and pot is that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> won't . When given the choice of receiving an injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">THC</ENAMEX> or a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">placebo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> consistently choose the placebo. And when given the choice
between a placebo and the cannabinoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker</ENAMEX>, rats choose the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tens</ENAMEX> of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, as we know, willingly partake of marijuana, and these
differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and human behavior should discourage us from using two
rat studies to assert that a) marijuana is addictive in the same way as harder
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> are and b) marijuana primes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> for addiction to harder <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX> studies also ignore simple truths about brain chemistry.
Consider that sex causes dramatic increases in dopamine. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laughter</ENAMEX>, too,
increases dopamine. The syllogism that dopamine equals pleasure and pleasure
leads to addiction just doesn't apply directly to human behavior. How seriously
would anyone take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> who suggested that laughter could lead to drugs
and deadly addictions?

            And the CRF-producing process associated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
with marijuana withdrawal is not unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. Just as sex increases
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dopamine</ENAMEX> in the accumbens, stubbing one's toe may ignite neurological anxiety.
Indeed, chronic toe-stubbing can lead to the abuse of analgesics like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>.
Again, the science reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX> is reputable. It's just taken out
of context.

            Also lost in the mix is that
fact that other published and studies have found that cannabinoids don't
increase dopamine in the accumbens. Still other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have shown that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> don't like the effects of cannabinoids any more than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> do. But
findings like these that don't support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s drug agenda are rarely
catapulted into the news by the publicity machine.

            So let's set aside for a
moment the drug preferences and predilections and propensities of rats and turn
our attention back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">estimated 70 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> who have
tried marijuana, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1 percent</NUMEX> have gone on to heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> use. Perhaps NIDA
and the pliant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> should inject themselves with a big dose of common
sense.
