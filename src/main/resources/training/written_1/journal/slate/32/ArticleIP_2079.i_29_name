            Everybody knows that small
business creates all the jobs. Why, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only last week</TIMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice-</ENAMEX>presidential
debate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> argued with evangelical passion for a small-business
capital-gains cut to grow the economy faster. "How about the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> that create <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91 percent</NUMEX> of all the new jobs?" he asked. A
few <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks earlier</TIMEX>, during the minimum-wage debate (in which small business was
once again singled out for favored tax treatment), virtually every opponent
argued that raising the minimum wage could hurt small businesses--which create
most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s jobs.

            This mantra is repeated so
often that everybody believes it. But everybody is wrong.

            What does
it take to kill a bad statistic? More than a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laureate</ENAMEX>, apparently. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milton</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedman</ENAMEX>, a conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponent</ENAMEX> of free-market solutions,
pointed out in a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of Economic Literature</ENAMEX> article that the
myth of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>' job-creating potency is one of the most durable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">falsehoods of America</ENAMEX>'s political economy. Numerous other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX>--and even
the occasional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX>--have tried to debunk the myth, but to no avail.

            For example, in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"On the Size Distribution</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Employment and Establishments</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Leonard</ENAMEX> finds that large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> are
the main job generators. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census Bureau</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellows</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. Davis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. Haltiwanger</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. Schuh</ENAMEX>, recently published a report titled "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Business</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Job</ENAMEX>
Creation: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dissecting the Myth and Reassessing the Facts</ENAMEX>," in which they assert
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flatly</ENAMEX>, "Conventional wisdom about the job-creation prowess of small business
rests on statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fallacies</ENAMEX> and misleading interpretations of the data."
(.)

            Magazines
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> have recently run articles like "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debunking</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Business</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myth</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Small Is Not Beautiful</ENAMEX>," "Doing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Business Shuffle</ENAMEX>," and "The
Real <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Engine of U.S. Economic Growth Might Be Bigger Than Any Believe</ENAMEX>," all of
which have declared the small-business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>'s claim "phony."

            
               Where the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bad Data Come From</ENAMEX>
            

            Not only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> but
newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> continue to perpetuate the small-business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fallacy</ENAMEX>, usually
without challenge. Take an article in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX> 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles</ENAMEX>

               Times on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 6</TIMEX>, which referred to "<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98 percent</NUMEX> of all jobs since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>
being created by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>." Where do these
numbers come from? The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Advocacy</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Business Administration</ENAMEX>
will gladly supply you with a table that might appear, at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance, to lend
support to such claims (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).

            Look
across the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> row, for example, which seems to tell you that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> with no
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> netted an astounding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,898,600</NUMEX> jobs by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>.

            Add in the
jobs created by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">499</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next five</TIMEX> rows),
and you would compute that small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> (defined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX> as having fewer
than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>) added all but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44,800</NUMEX> of the total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.4 million</NUMEX> net jobs
gained by the economy over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that period</TIMEX>.

            
Well, what's the matter with that? The matter,
of course, is that the rows broken out by initial firm size tell only part of
the story--the happy part. What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX> doesn't make clear in the table it hands
out (though it will tell you if you persist) is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>-size rows only
include those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> that "made it"--i.e., those that stayed continuously in
business throughout the period.
            

            And, of
course, it is a fact of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s dynamic marketplace that while many
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>--especially small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>--open for business <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> and hire new
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, almost as many close their doors, sending their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> onto the
unemployment rolls. Overcounting gains and undercounting losses in this and
other ways is what produces the grossly exaggerated picture of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX>'s
contribution to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economists</ENAMEX> call the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX>'s technique of
sorting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> size in a dynamic situation the "regression fallacy."

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of the Census Data</ENAMEX>, prepared under contract (table prepared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>).
            

            Focus on the top row, the one
optimistically labeled "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Net Births</ENAMEX>" in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX>'s version. These are the net changes
(mostly net losses) in job counts produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> that either opened or
closed during the period. Looking down at the now-complete bottom-row totals,
you will get quite a different picture of where the net new jobs are. By this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calculation</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some 1,673,400</NUMEX> (or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 70 percent</NUMEX>) of the jobs still around in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> were added by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX>--i.e., by
"big" business.

            
Classifying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> by their end--rather than start--size might also seem unfair,
since some very successful small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> may end up big by the close of the
period, and vice versa. We need a more dynamic model to get a real sense of
what's going on.

            

               Going With the Flow
            

            Getting a
good fix on this phenomenon isn't easy, because most government data are
collected to measure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> employment changes, and there are no current data
available on gross job flows by business size. As a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX>,
however, I was able to specify the preparation of special tabulations by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census Bureau</ENAMEX> from business payroll tax reports for the entire private nonfarm
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX>. These tabulations make it possible, for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, to study job
flows for the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> as they migrate from one employment size class
to another.

            These
statistics-- never released by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX> and published here for the first
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> --tell a fascinating story of job creation and destruction. For
example, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> increased by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> in the period
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1989 and 1991</TIMEX>. This end result, however, was produced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 1,260,000</NUMEX>
firm "births" (a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> reporting no payroll in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, but some payroll in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>),
which were offset by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,230,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> "deaths."

            Looking at job flows by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> size (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), we see
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> that remained small (including those that entered or went out of
business) lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">192,000</NUMEX> jobs during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this recession</TIMEX> period.

Employment gains from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> going from small to
large were essentially offset by employment losses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> that were large and
became small. But on net, there was a job gain of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69,000</NUMEX> for
"boundary-crossing" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>. At the same time, large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> (again including
those that opened or closed) added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">802,000</NUMEX> to their payrolls. Subtracting the
small-business losses from the big-business gains gives us a net total of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">679,000</NUMEX> jobs added to the entire economy during this period. The analysis thus
confirms what earlier studies had suggested: Big business, not small business,
is the primary generator of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> jobs.

            
Predictably, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX>'s counts show a totally different (and false) picture (see
bottom of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). By using <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning-year</TIMEX> counting rule, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX> reports
that small business generated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">557,000</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82 percent</NUMEX>, of the jobs. If the
end-year counting rule is used, small business destroyed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">872,000</NUMEX> jobs. Neither
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">statistic</ENAMEX> is reflective of the job-generation process; they measure only
economic volatility.

            Of course, the period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1989 and 1991</TIMEX> was one of
recession. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census Bureau</ENAMEX> counts show that during the phase of rapid
growth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1982 to 1987</TIMEX>, an equal number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> in each size class
reported job gains as losses. This same result held true in the period from
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989 to 1991</TIMEX>, demonstrating again that, irrespective of business-cycle
conditions, the probability that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> will add or lay off <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> is
independent of its size. Analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX> net-change data for the
expansionary period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1991 and 1993</TIMEX> also reveals that small businesses
created jobs in proportion to their numbers--no more, and no less.

            A simple economic explanation
accounts for these observations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Firms</ENAMEX> are constantly competing with each
other. Both small and large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> expand when there is a demand for their
goods and services that they can meet efficiently. All the economic research
suggests that there is no difference in the efficiency of small and large firms
once a firm grows beyond a minimum size. It is for this reason that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau</ENAMEX> data for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 50 years</TIMEX> show no evidence of any change in the
employment size distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> and establishments.

            All this might not matter, if
the small-business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fallacy</ENAMEX> were not used by its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> as justification for
carving exemptions and preferences for small business into virtually every
piece of economic legislation that passes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of this
magazine wrote in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1993</TIMEX>, "Small
business is an important part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> economy. Most small-business
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> are admirable, hard-working, patriotic. But the case for tilting public
policy in favor of 'small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX>' is based on logical fallacies and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyists</ENAMEX>' hokum."
