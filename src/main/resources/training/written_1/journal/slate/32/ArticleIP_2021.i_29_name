            Back when I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> joined
the ranks of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-worlders, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a decade ago</TIMEX>, we were an easy species to
describe: earnest, well meaning, and hopelessly naive. We envisioned an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eventual</ENAMEX> era of global peace, a time when nationalism had lost its edge and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">nation-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> had surrendered some sovereignty to global forums like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nations</ENAMEX> or even a true <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Parliament</ENAMEX>. This fuzzy idealism earned us the
moniker "woolly-minded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-worlders" as well as the (often correct) stereotype
that we were raving lefties.

            But then came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>.
With the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> over and economic globalization accelerating, the ideological
map went topsy-turvy. Suddenly books <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giddily</ENAMEX> proclaiming <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Twilight of</ENAMEX>
Sovereignty were being written not by the beads-and-sandals <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>, but by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">capitalists</ENAMEX> (former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citibank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Wriston</ENAMEX>, in the case of that title).
Meanwhile, less enthusiastic tracts, with ominous titles like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">One World</ENAMEX>,
Ready or Not , were being written by raving lefties (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Greider</ENAMEX>), who
now saw the withering of the nation-state as deeply problematic.

            While
this new debate rages, though, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-worldism marches on. We may never get to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Parliament</ENAMEX> phase. But the migration of governance from the national to
the supranational level is proceeding apace, in lots of little but ultimately
momentous ways. If this fact were more widely appreciated, globalization might
get a warmer reception on the left.

            
The reason left and right seem to have traded
places over "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-worldism" is that the term has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> meaning.
Old-school <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-worlders (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woodrow Wilson</ENAMEX>) were concerned mainly with
peace. The aspect of the nation-state they most wanted to constrain was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggression</ENAMEX>. What excites <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wriston</ENAMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX>) is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constraint</ENAMEX> placed on a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s domestic policies by worldwide capitalism.
Global bond markets punish national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> that splurge on safety nets.
Global labor markets punish <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> with a high minimum wage or costly
environmental standards. "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> world" now means a single planetary market that
can sweep away national policies designed in a simpler era to blunt the
market's sharp edges.

            Hence
the sudden provincialism of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX>. Supranational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAFTA</ENAMEX> are seen as mere lubricants of laissez faire. And for
now, at least, they indeed are little more than that. Still, even the new
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-worldism ought to hold some appeal for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">believers</ENAMEX> in the old version, like
me, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> reasons.

            
First, remember <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">world</ENAMEX> peace? You know--the
mushy ideal that got us laughed off the stage in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place? Supranational
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> are its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>. In the recent book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">War Before Civilization</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Keeley</ENAMEX> observes that trade by itself is not inherently pacifying.
Indeed, the dependence it creates can be volatile. Witness <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s testy
response, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 7, 1941</TIMEX>, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> cutting off oil exports. But,
as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keeley</ENAMEX> also notes, when international tribunals exist to resolve disputes,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX> is generally pacifying. So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX> should spell less bloodshed.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX> already does.

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, remember universal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brotherhood</ENAMEX>? You know--concern for the world's poor and downtrodden? As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paul</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krugman</ENAMEX> recently
noted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>, free trade gives <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> a step up the
ladder. Yes, that may mean working in a sweatshop. But these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> manifestly
prefer that to their prior condition. It may come as a shock to some suburban
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX>, but for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, the alternative to stitching
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reebok</ENAMEX> soccer balls is not being driven to soccer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volvo</ENAMEX> station
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">wagon</ENAMEX>. It's deeper poverty.

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>,
even leaving lofty universalism aside, international trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> can
help promote a liberal agenda domestically. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> the left supports the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX> and the right doesn't. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meddles</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> affairs with intrusive lefty regulation. Maybe the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tories</ENAMEX> are right
that some of the regulation is excessive, but much of it isn't. And, anyway, my
point is just that a supranational trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> can in principle be supported
by--and thus be shaped by--a center-left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX>, rather than a center-right
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coalition</ENAMEX>.

            
Consider <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAFTA</ENAMEX>. It passed on a center-right
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coalition</ENAMEX> and reflects that fact. But it's not beyond change. For negotiations
to admit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chile</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> wants a reluctant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to authorize him
to include labor and environmental accords. So, if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> sticks to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>
(a big "if") and prevails, we may have a new and improved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAFTA</ENAMEX>. It could, say,
impose stricter environmental standards on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chile</ENAMEX> and give <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chilean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> the right to bargain collectively. Both provisions would
raise <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin American</ENAMEX> labor costs, and thus dull <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAFTA</ENAMEX>'s adverse effect on some
low-wage <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. In essence, this approach would use political
globalization to to a slightly less jarring pace.

            It is
strange that so many of those most offended by globalization call themselves
"progressives." <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Early this century</TIMEX>, the progressives were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who realized
that communications and transportation technologies were pushing the scope of
economic activity outward, from individual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> as a
whole. They responded by pushing economic regulation from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to the
federal level. The analogous leap <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is from national to supranational
regulation. Yet many of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s progressives are economic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationalists</ENAMEX>, viewing
unilateral tariffs as the policy tool of choice.

            
Evolutionary psychology tells us that economic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intercourse</ENAMEX> is about as deeply ingrained in the human brain as any other form
of intercourse. (If you doubt this, read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Ridley</ENAMEX>'s excellent new book,
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Origins of Virtue</ENAMEX> .) That's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason the ever expanding scope of
economic activity is essentially a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of nature--it can be guided, it can be
slowed, but it can't, realistically, be stopped. The original progressives
chose to swim with this basic current of history. Many of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s
"progressives" are swimming against it.

            Still,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">globalization</ENAMEX> is, willy-nilly, turning even progressives into de facto
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-worlders. Witness the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-sweatshop</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortium</ENAMEX>, featuring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nike</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liz</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Claiborne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathie Lee Gifford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>. al. It sets minimally <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humane</ENAMEX> working
conditions that foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> must meet if their products are to sport a
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No Sweat</ENAMEX>" label. And it arose not out of the goodness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nike</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knight</ENAMEX>'s heart, but to keep left-wing nongovernmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>--especially
"progressive" ones--off his back. (The of supranational NGO lobbying in general
is analyzed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica Mathews</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January/February</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Affairs</ENAMEX> .)
Thus the old left, intentionally or not, is pushing us from national regulation
to supranational regulation--albeit, in this case, a kind of private-sector
supranational regulation.

            
In a way, the "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-world" battle is over. Once
you exclude fringe elements on both sides--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Nader</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Buchanan</ENAMEX>,
basically--both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> accept the reality of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAFTA</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX> even as they argue about whether these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> should include environmental
and labor laws, à la the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>. Thus, the existence of supranational bodies with
significant functions of governance is no longer the issue. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mainstream</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> sure aren't complaining about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX>'s power to penalize
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> that fail to open their telecommunications to foreign investment.)
The issue, rather, is the perennial issue: whether governance will be to the
right or the left. In that sense, we're all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-worlders now.

            In fact, we're all
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-worlders even in the old beads-and-sandals sense. Well, almost all. As this
column is posted, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> is poised to vote on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Weapons</ENAMEX>
Convention. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CWC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> may muster the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> votes needed to prevent a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> ratification vote (thanks to the earnest but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clueless</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Helms</ENAMEX>
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the most rabidly reactionary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> in politics <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>: the
Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> 's editorial page and a reptilian <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> vestige
called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for Security Policy</ENAMEX>). Even so, the fact remains that this
unprecedentedly strong form of global arms control--the sort of thing peacenik
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hippies</ENAMEX> could only dream about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade ago</TIMEX>--now commands mainstream support:
all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>, around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Presidents</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> (and, for all we know, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>).

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old days</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX>
wanted peace and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> wanted law and order--a nice, stable environment
for commerce. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CWC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who realize
that, in the modern world, where neither commerce nor terrorism knows national
boundaries, peace is order.
