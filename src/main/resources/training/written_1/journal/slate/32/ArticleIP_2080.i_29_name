            Ever since it was announced
at a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX> press conference that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> was the cause of the immune-system mayhem
known as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seers</ENAMEX> have periodically predicted that the end of the epidemic
was near. But the trumpets have grown louder in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent weeks</TIMEX>, as the success of
the "triple-combo therapy" of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protease inhibitors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AZT</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3TC</ENAMEX> has been
recorded.

            
Popularizing these findings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-positive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>. Writing on the front page of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 8</TIMEX> Wall Street
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Sanford</ENAMEX> described how new anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> treatments had
rescued him from death's door (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Last Year, This Editor Wrote His Own</ENAMEX>
Obituary"). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two days later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Sullivan</ENAMEX> published his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,400</NUMEX>-word literary
tour de force, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">When AIDS Ends</ENAMEX>," in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Magazine</ENAMEX> .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX>, the success of new anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> has triggered the
"twilight of an epidemic"--for those who can afford the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">$10,000-plus</NUMEX>-a-year
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regimens</ENAMEX>. A diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection, he contends, "no longer signifies
death," but "merely signifies <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>."

            Study after study has shown that in many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the
triple-combo therapy so dramatically reduces the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> found in
blood--their viral loads--that the most sensitive tests available cannot detect
the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX>. An "undetectable" viral load is not the same as being free of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>,
but many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> believe that less virus equals <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less</NUMEX> damage to the immune
system. For certain, the new treatments are having a visible effect on the
health of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Sanford</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lazarus</ENAMEX>-like turnaround attests.
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, encouraged by the early results with triple-combo
therapy, are investigating whether it's possible to completely clear--"or
eradicate"--<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who begin treatment shortly after
becoming infected.

            Given
their personal struggles against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX>'s exhilaration at
this news is understandable. But their celebrations are premature--the defeat
of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> is completely overstated. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> still poses a sobering list of scientific
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unknowns</ENAMEX>, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">optimists</ENAMEX> dismiss far too quickly. With all best wishes to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX>, it's foolhardy for him to say, "I've survived this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scourge</ENAMEX>," and that
because of the advent of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protease inhibitors</ENAMEX>, "I am probably more likely to be
hit by a truck than to die of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sullivan</ENAMEX>'s more daring pronouncement that
"this ordeal as a whole may be over" is likely to mislead sick <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in need
of hope. And the argument that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> is conquered may also lend a sharper <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ax</ENAMEX> to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> who perennially argue to cut the AIDS-research budget.

            
There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical
about the power of these new treatments. There are scant data to explain how
long these new treatments will prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and extend life--no formal
studies have been completed that compare <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of untreated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Another downside to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> is that they often
make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> feel nauseated and can have serious toxicities. In some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,
these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> only work for a short time; in others, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
undetectable, but their immune systems are too damaged to rebound. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> remains
a stealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foe</ENAMEX>: It can take refuge in body tissues (as opposed to blood), where
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> have a harder time reaching. And the virus routinely mutates into
strains that are resistant to every <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> that has proven effective against
it.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sullivan</ENAMEX>'s article notes
these depressing findings alongside his good news. But there is plenty of bad
news that he doesn't report. The lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX> (and other sites in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>) can
be packed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> even when the virus is undetectable in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>. At last
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">summer</ENAMEX>'s international <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> conference, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> described a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who had
been treated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">78 weeks</TIMEX> with a combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, and in whom they could
detect no virus. When he stopped taking his <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>, high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
returned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> told me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
recently died from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, even though their viral loads had become undetectable
with the new drug treatments. Just because you drive a viral load to the point
where it can't be detected doesn't mean the immune system returns to normal.
There are also the practical obstacles to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> optimism. Taking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two dozen</NUMEX> or
more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX> a day, on a schedule, is a daunting task to carry out for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> on
end. Missed pills lower the potency of the treatment, opening the way to
drug-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV mutants</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> has a
long history of laughing last.

            I'm not a defeatist, mind you. Measured optimism is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">warranted</ENAMEX>. Although the vast majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the world
cannot afford these new treatments, for those who can, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> will possibly
stave off disease and death. But, because no one knows whether these new leases
on life should be measured in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, balancing
optimism and pessimism requires a delicate touch.

            Consider
the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AZT</ENAMEX>, which has seesawed in the public perception from
panacea to poison and back again. When first approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AZT</ENAMEX>
was hailed as a godsend. Then it was denounced as ineffective by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX>,
after larger studies showed that, when taken alone, the drug offered little
except to the sickest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Worse yet, many HIV-infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> viewed the
drug as a worthless poison being hawked by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> who were on the take
from a greedy pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AZT</ENAMEX> is seen as a mediocre but
useful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>: It has a place in the triple-combo therapy, and it can prevent
the transmission of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> from infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> to their babies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.

            
From here, many <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> are putting
their hopes on combining drug treatments with strategies that boost the immune
system. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> example, triple-combo therapy is now being tested in
conjunction with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">interleukin-2</TIMEX>, an immune-system <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messenger</ENAMEX> that theoretically
can help rev up the natural machinery that clears the virus from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>.

            But the real hope for ending
the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> epidemic is not expensive drug therapies. Never in the annals of
medicine has a viral plague been stopped by any therapy. Viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plagues</ENAMEX> such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">smallpox</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">polio</ENAMEX>, measles, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> B, rabies, and other once-terrifying
scourges have only been beaten back by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX>. It is most perplexing then,
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX>, who is writing about the end of an epidemic, after all, never
mentions the word "vaccine" in his article. That's because his true focus isn't
the end of the epidemic, but lengthening the lives of the already infected.

            The search for an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> currently needs serious help, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, the biggest
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> in the effort, spending <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10 percent</NUMEX> of its AIDS-research
budget on the problem. And, primarily because of the daunting scientific
obstacles, woefully few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have an aggressive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>-vaccine program.

            So roll
up the red carpet, send the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> home, and recork the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">champagne</ENAMEX>. These rumors
of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> survival are greatly exaggerated.
