            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX>, as you're
surely aware, has spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $40 million</NUMEX> on his investigation of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. That comes to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly 15 cents</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>. If there's an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
who hasn't got <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15 cents</NUMEX> worth of entertainment out of this affair, I've yet to
meet him. On that basis alone, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> investigation might be one of the best
bargains the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> have ever had.

            There is,
however, a larger issue. Independent counsels are not punished for
overspending, so in general they'll have a tendency to overspend. Over the past
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven months</TIMEX> or so, a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have made that point, but few have placed
it in its proper context. Overspending due to bad incentives is not a problem
with independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> investigations in particular; it's a problem with
government undertakings in general.

            To address that problem by tinkering with the independent
counsel statute--or even by abolishing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> altogether--amounts to a
failure of perspective. No matter how deeply you believe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> has egregiously
misspent your <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15 cents</NUMEX>, it would require extraordinary naivet√© to imagine that
he's dealt you the most devastating financial blow you've suffered at the hands
of an overzealous public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>.

            So instead
of obsessing over a minor symptom of a major ailment, maybe we should devote
more attention to the underlying disease. If the disease is incurable, we can
at least think about how best to alleviate entire clusters of symptoms.

            
To that end, abolishing the independent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">counsel</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> is not terribly useful. Maybe that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> should be
abolished--but it would be a shame if that was the only insight we gained from
this episode. Applying the same insight to more serious instances of spending
run amok, we'll end up making recommendations like "abolish the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>" or
"abolish the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Health and Human Services</ENAMEX>"--recommendations that are
surely unrealistic and possibly unwise. We'll learn more if we ask questions
like this: Assuming that we're going to have an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX>, how can we
adjust his incentives to make him more fiscally responsible? By thinking about
that question, we might learn something about how to encourage fiscal
responsibility more generally.

            Here's an
idea: Make the independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> finance his investigations out of his own
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pocket</ENAMEX>. At the same time, reward him handsomely for results, such as
convictions or impeachments. That sets up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> good incentives. First, when
there's good reason to suspect provable wrongdoing, the prospective reward
encourages prosecutorial tenacity. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, when investigations devolve into
nothing more than political or personal harassment, the prospective expense
encourages <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> to shut down sooner rather than later.

            There's another advantage to this system. Once the
independent counsels become independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX>, it will be relatively easy
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> to adjust their activity levels. If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> is too lax,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> can either raise the bounty for convictions or subsidize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX>'s
expenses--say, by making him pay only some percentage of those expenses; the
percentage can be fine-tuned at will. If he is too inquisitorial, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> can
do the opposite. So <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> retain control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX>'s overall
fervor while inducing him to concentrate that fervor where it's most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">warranted</ENAMEX>.

            Similar
schemes might improve the performance of any government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> that has clearly
defined goals. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> is charged with
keeping dangerous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pharmaceuticals</ENAMEX> off the market. Here the potential problem is
not so much excessive spending as excessive caution, which creates unwarranted
delays in the introduction of safe and effective new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. But that's not a
different problem--it's the same problem in a different guise. Just as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> is tempted to overprosecute when he's spending other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s money,
so also is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> tempted to overregulate when he's playing with other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s health. If the problems are fundamentally the same, then so are the
solutions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX>, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX>, should bear the costs of his
actions. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way to accomplish that is to pay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> not in cash but in
pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> stock, which ought to introduce an appropriate sense of
urgency to the drug approval process. Unfortunately, it will also discourage
diligence--but we can correct that by levying large fines against the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> whenever a deadly drug slips through to the marketplace.

            
The net result could be an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> approval process
that is either more or less stringent than it is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, at the option of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> who determine the size of the stock grants and the size of the
fines. But either way, it would give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> an incentive to focus their
attention more precisely on those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that are most likely to be
problematic.

            Rewarding
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for good outcomes and punishing them for bad ones is relatively easy
when the quality of the outcomes is easy to measure. But it's harder for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> with broader portfolios of responsibility. Take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, for
example. How do we know when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> had done a good job? Should we
reward him for keeping us out of war? What if he keeps us out of war through
policies that make the world more dangerous for our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>? Should we reward
him for prosperity? What if that prosperity is a temporary illusion? And who
should decide?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> system of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has ever dealt adequately
with the incentive problem for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive</ENAMEX>, and that's hereditary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">monarchy</ENAMEX>. When you know that your beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heirs</ENAMEX> are going to, in essence, own
the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, you tend to take a long-range view of the national
interest. Unfortunately, hereditary monarchy has offsetting drawbacks, which I
assume I don't need to enumerate for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of 
                  Slate
               .

            But here's
a way to recover some of the advantages of monarchy while retaining the
advantages of our current system of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. We could pay our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX>
their salaries in land instead of in cash. The price of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">land</ENAMEX> reflects
the value of living in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States of America</ENAMEX>. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> mortgages
our future by weakening defense, the price of land will fall. If he raises
taxes to support "defense" programs that fail to justify their costs, once
again the price of land will fall. So by giving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> a sufficiently
diversified portfolio--some ranch <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">land</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX>, a bit of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coastline</ENAMEX>, a few blocks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Bronx</ENAMEX>, a hill in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX>--we can ensure
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s interests and his personal interests coincide. Whenever the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> makes a bad decision, his pocketbook will surely feel our pain.

            
Here's another way to accomplish the same
thing. Allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, upon leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, to sell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">citizenships</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX> of his choice. (We can add some side conditions
that prohibit him from dealing with known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> and other undesirables.)
If he does a better job, those citizenships will become more valuable, and
he'll get a better price for them.

            Let me close by answering in
advance the question that I know I'll be asked in e-mail, namely, "Are you
really serious?" The answer is no and yes. No, I don't believe that anything
I've said in this <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> word column amounts to a detailed policy proposal. But
yes, I believe that incentives matter and that we should seriously entertain
radical proposals for improving them. Even when we ultimately reject those
proposals, we learn something by articulating their flaws. And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every now</TIMEX> and
then a "crazy" idea stops seeming crazy once you've thought about it hard
enough.
