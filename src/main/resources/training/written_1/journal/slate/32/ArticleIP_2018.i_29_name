            Don't get me wrong. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kids</ENAMEX> are
great. I have some, and I adore them. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every Christmas</TIMEX> I become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX> to my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">camcorder</ENAMEX>. Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow, and so on. But now that the
radiance of the yuletide season is fading, it's time to confront a sobering
scientific truth: The more you think about the biology of parental love, the
more absurd it seems. The same goes for love of kin generally--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sisters</ENAMEX>, nephews, etc.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX>
familiar with my obsessions may fear that this column is just another attempt
to spoil everyone's fun, to replace the beautiful mystery of life with ugly
Darwinian clarity. Actually, what I hope to dispel isn't pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> mystery,
but a kind of post-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> mysticism, a confused exaltation of genetic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affinity</ENAMEX>. You see the confusion when biological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> invoke "blood ties" to
reclaim a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> from adoptive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. You see it when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-ethnic adoption argue--as in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> op-ed piece a few
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months ago</TIMEX>--that we must respect "the strength of the biological and cultural
ties that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> can offer their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>." In a sense, you see it
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> pay lip service to the idea of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">universal</ENAMEX> brotherhood but believe in their hearts that it's ridiculous, that
truly loving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to whom you aren't related violates some law of nature.

            Thanks to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Hamilton</ENAMEX>, it is now clear
why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> feel brotherly love in the literal sense--and sisterly love,
maternal love, and paternal love. It's all due to the operation of "kin
selection" during evolution. A greatly oversimplified textbook example: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hominids, Loveless Bob and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loving Bob</ENAMEX>, stand on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
different riverbanks, in identical situations. Each is watching his full
sibling Bill drown. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loving Bob</ENAMEX> has a gene inclining him to love his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> and
thus jump in the raging river, even though his risk of dying is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loveless Bob</ENAMEX> has no such gene, and thus stands on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> wondering whether
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpse</ENAMEX> will attract any large, edible <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>. Which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX>'s genes
will survive the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> reaper--<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for love or for cold indifference?

            Love triumphs. True, there's
a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-in-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> chance that the love gene will sink along with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loving Bob</ENAMEX>. But
consider the upside. There's a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-in-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> chance that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX>'s full sibling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bill</ENAMEX>
has the same gene and, thus, that a successful rescue mission will pluck an
otherwise doomed copy of the gene from the dustbin of history. Do the math, and
you'll see that, over time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loving Bobs</ENAMEX> send more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> to posterity than
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loveless Bobs</ENAMEX>. As love genes spread at the expense of indifference genes,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loveless Bobs</ENAMEX> slowly become extinct. Die, selfish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scum</ENAMEX>! Genes for sibling love
come to permeate our species--as, in fact, they now do. So do genes for
maternal love and paternal love. All brought to you by kin selection.

            As modern
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darwinism</ENAMEX> gets popularized, the basic idea of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kin</ENAMEX> selection is approaching the
status of conventional wisdom. So are some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendant misconceptions</ENAMEX>.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Misconception No. 1</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Genes</ENAMEX> are smart .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> often assume that kin-selected altruism is foolproof; that a gene can
magically sense copies of itself in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>--or, at least, can somehow
ascertain with perfect accuracy which organisms are close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of its own
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host organism</ENAMEX> and thus may carry copies of itself. In truth, genes aren't
omniscient, or even sentient. If kin-selected genes are going to induce love of
kin, they'll have to determine who qualifies as kin in some pedestrian and
probably fallible way.

            For
example: Back when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loving Bob</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 years old</TIMEX>, if his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was nursing some
infant named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> and sleeping by its side <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX>, there's a very good
chance that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX>'s sibling. So a gene disposing <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bob to love children</ENAMEX>
whom he sees his mother <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurturing</ENAMEX> could spread through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> until
everyone obeys the same rule. But this rule would misfire <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now and then</TIMEX>, when a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX> is for some reason nurturing a non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX>. It's just that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misfiring</ENAMEX> wouldn't happen often enough to greatly dilute the genetic math
favoring the gene's proliferation.

            Little is known about which rules for identifying
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kin</ENAMEX>--"kin-recognition mechanisms"--do operate in our species. But clearly, they
are fallible. Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>, who you'd think would have a damn good idea of who
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> are, can in principle be fooled. When hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> for
some reason handed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimberly Mays</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> who was not hers, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX>'s kin-recognition mechanisms--a k a bonding processes--kicked in. This
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> wound up loving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimberly</ENAMEX> like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> (though the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> died two
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years later</TIMEX>, so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimberly</ENAMEX> was reared mostly by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stepmother</ENAMEX>). Meanwhile,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimberly</ENAMEX>'s genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, having missed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of bonding, can never love
Kimberly quite like her own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, even though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimberly</ENAMEX> is her own
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. Because genetic relationship per se doesn't matter.

            This
irrelevance of genes is why surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">motherhood</ENAMEX> is so messy. Even when, thanks
to in vitro fertilization, the birth <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> is unrelated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> she
carries, she will, upon giving birth, fall in love with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. During
evolution, after all, having a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> come out of your womb was reasonably strong
evidence of kinship. The power of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> that govern this bonding is
familiar to anyone who has watched a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> clutch her just-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and turn
into a love-drunk cuddle-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bunny</ENAMEX>. (When my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> went through this magic moment, I
briefly considered snatching the baby and replacing it with an <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8-by-10</NUMEX> glossy
of myself.) This hormonal power was also observed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> studying
oxytocin, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> that's present in human and other mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> at
birth. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> put it in a syringe and used it to shatter all previous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> for cuddling among laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. By the way, the synthetic version
of oxytocin, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pitocin</ENAMEX>, is what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> use to induce labor.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Misconception No. 2</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are smart--or,
at least, they are smart <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> robots . Darwinian theory does posit that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homo sapiens</ENAMEX> were "designed" to get their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into the next generation, but
not that they were designed to do so consciously and rationally. As surrogate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> have proved, knowing that you've given no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> to an infant needn't
stop the bonding process. Thus, "kin- recognition mechanism" is a doubly
misleading term--first because, as we've seen, the mechanism doesn't positively
identify kin, but just identifies factors correlated with kinship; and second
because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> aren't really aware of doing the identifying. We don't
think, "There's strong evidence that she's my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, so I adore her." More
like, "God but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s adorable."

            It is
good news for adoptive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> that neither genetic relationship nor conscious
awareness of genetic relationship is a prerequisite for love. Still, it is bad
news that maternal bonding begins with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> at birth. It is also bad news
that breast-feeding, which adoptive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> usually can't do, releases the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bonding hormone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxytocin</ENAMEX>. Then again, there is no reason in principle that
adoptive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> couldn't take <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pitocin</ENAMEX> once a day for synthetic bonding
sessions. (Oxytocin seems to be part of the bonding formula in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, too.)
Besides, some genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> aren't conscious at birth, and many don't
breast-feed, yet they all nonetheless wind up loving their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. As the many
successful adoptive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> know, lots of the magic moments that add up to
durabonding have nothing to do with birthing or breast-feeding. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tiny tots</ENAMEX>,
with their eyes all aglow ... )

            Anyway, the main point is that when genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> give up
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> for adoption and have second thoughts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, or even years
later, their appeals to blood ties should count for zilch. Their love of their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s love of them, depends not on genetic math but on a
long and complex <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of bonding, much of which they have already voluntarily
missed out on.

            Similarly,
the idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>, or black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>, or whatever, have some
mystical genetic affinity with their "own" kind is silly. Obviously,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-ethnic adoption is dicey. It draws sidelong glances and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX>
taunts, and it may give the adopted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> an identity crisis. But it won't do
this because of some ancestral memory in the genes. As attitudes change,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-ethnic adoption will get easier; and as cross-ethnic adoption gets more
common, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX> will change. (There are other pop-genetics arguments against
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-ethnic adoption, and against adoption in general. One is that genes
influence personality so powerfully that mixing unrelated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> is like
mixing oil and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. This idea is .)

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Misconception No. 3</ENAMEX>: Our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, though
perhaps not real smart, aren't downright stupid . Here we come, at last, to
the true absurdity of familial love. As we've seen, the genes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> it
flourished by encouraging an "altruism" that was, in fact, self-serving at the
genetic level (the inexorable triumph of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loving Bob</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>). As we've also
seen, these genes can be "fooled" into encouraging altruism toward non-kin,
altruism that presumably is not self-serving at the genetic level.
Still, you might argue, in defense of your genes, they usually direct
familial love toward genuine kin, and thus usually succeed in being efficiently
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">selfish</ENAMEX>. Wrong! When genes confine altruism to kin, and deny it to needy
non-kin, they are in fact failing spectacularly to be efficiently selfish.
Because nowadays, copies of these genes do reside in non-kin--in your
next-door <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> and, for that matter, your worst <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>. After all, the
Darwinian logic behind love of kin was so relentless that these genes permeated
our entire species! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loveless Bob</ENAMEX> is extinct, remember?

            You can
be forgiven for doubting my logic. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> like me, in writing about kin
selection, often talk about full siblings sharing "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>," implying
that nonrelatives share none. But in truth, you share virtually all your genes
with any randomly selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homo sapien</ENAMEX> on any continent. What <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like me
really mean is that full <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> share half of any genes that are newly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">minted</ENAMEX>--genes that have recently arisen and on which natural selection is just
starting to pass judgment. Genes that natural selection fully endorsed long
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>--the basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for hunger, for lust, for familial love--are in everyone.
So genes that originally flourished by bestowing love with discerning
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">selfishness</ENAMEX>--by discriminating against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> not containing copies of
themselves--now, having spread through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, discriminate against people
who do contain copies! You may doubt that natural selection, a process
that supposedly maximizes genetic selfishness, could fail so abjectly to do so.
But it's true. .

            So <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past holiday season</TIMEX>, as you rushed to buy presents
for your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> or your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> or your nieces or nephews, impelled by
"selfishly" altruistic genes, you were operating under flawed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> logic.
These "selfish" genes could do just as much for themselves by encouraging you
to instead spend your money on the beggar outside the department store. In
fact, they could do more, since the beggar is closer to perishing than your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> are. (Also, the beggar might buy something useful such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, as
opposed to a hair-eating <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cabbage Patch</ENAMEX> doll.) But our genes are too stupid to
so deftly serve their own welfare.

            Not that I attach much weight
to what is and isn't "good" from the standpoint of genetic self-interest. As
virtually all ethical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosophers</ENAMEX> who have pondered the matter agree, it
doesn't make sense to model our moral values on the logic of nature anyway; to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infer</ENAMEX> ought from is --to commit the "naturalistic fallacy"--only
leads to moral confusion. For example, you might, after observing the natural
behavior of praying mantises, be tempted to conclude that it is morally good
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> to eat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> after sex--and this, I submit, would be a repugnant
and wrongheaded doctrine! (Though slightly less repugnant than the idea of
eating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> before the sex.)

            Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> implicitly
recognize the naturalistic fallacy in some contexts. They sense that there's
something visceral about, say, malice; yet they'll tell you (when not in its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrall</ENAMEX>) that they disapprove of it. It's obvious, they believe, that the
natural strength of hatred is not a good thing. They're right. What is equally
right, but a bit less obvious, is that the "natural" limits of love aren't
necessarily good either. And, on close inspection, these limits turn out not to
be all that rigorously "natural" anyway.
