            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Every night</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, following standard child-care advice, engage in a bloodcurdling
ritual. They put their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several-months-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> in a crib, leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, and
studiously ignore its crying. The crying may go on for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 or 30 minutes</TIMEX> before
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> is allowed to return. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> may then be patted but not picked up,
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> must quickly leave, after which the crying typically resumes.
Eventually sleep comes, but the ritual recurs when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> awakes during the
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. The same thing happens the next night, except that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> must wait
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes longer</TIMEX> before the designated patting. This goes on for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX>, two
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, maybe even a month. If all goes well, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> finally arrives when the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> can fall asleep without fuss and go the whole <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> without being fed.
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mommy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daddy</ENAMEX>, it's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> time.

            This is
known as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ferberizing</ENAMEX>" a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Ferber</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s best-known
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> on infant sleep. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> find his prescribed boot <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> for babies
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">agonizing</ENAMEX>, but they persist because they've been assured it's harmless. Ferber
depicts the ritual as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s natural progress toward nocturnal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">self-reliance</ENAMEX>. What sounds to the untrained ear like a baby wailing in
desperate protest of abandonment is described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferber</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> "learning
the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>."

            At this point I should own up to my bias: My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and I are
failed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferberizers</ENAMEX>. When our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> proved capable of crying for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> without reloading, we gave up and let her sleep in our bed. When our
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> showed up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years later</TIMEX>, we didn't even bother to set up
the crib. She wasn't too vocal and seemed a better candidate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferberization</ENAMEX>,
but we'd found we liked sleeping with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>.

            How did we
have the hubris to defy the mainstream of current child-care wisdom? That
brings me to my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> bias (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hauntingly</ENAMEX> familiar to regular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>):
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darwinism</ENAMEX>. For our species, the natural nighttime arrangement is for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to
sleep alongside their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first few years</TIMEX>. At least, that's the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">norm</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter</ENAMEX>-gatherer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX>, the closest things we have to a model of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> environment in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> evolved. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers nurse</ENAMEX> their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to
sleep and then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> on demand through <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX>. Sounds taxing, but it's not.
When the baby cries, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> starts nursing reflexively, often without
really waking up. If she does reach consciousness, she soon fades back to sleep
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, as I can personally attest, never leaves
Z-town.

            
So <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferberization</ENAMEX>, I submit, is unnatural. That
doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. The technique may well be harmless (though
maybe not, as we'll see below). I don't begrudge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferber</ENAMEX> the right to preach
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferberization</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who prefer sleeping sans child the right to practice
it. Live and let live. What's annoying is the refusal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferber</ENAMEX> and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> to reciprocate my magnanimity. They act as if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> like me are
derelict, as if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> need to fall asleep in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> alone. "Even if
you and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> seem happy about his sharing your bed at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>," writes
Ferber, "and even if he seems to sleep well there, in the long run this habit
will probably not be good for either of you." On television I've seen a father
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sheepishly</ENAMEX> admit to famous child-care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guru</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. Berry Brazelton</ENAMEX> that he likes
sleeping with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toddler</ENAMEX>. You'd think the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> had committed .

            Why,
exactly, is it bad to sleep with your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>? Learning to sleep alone, says
Ferber, lets your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> "see himself as an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>." I'm
puzzled. It isn't obvious to me how a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> would develop a robust sense of
autonomy while being confined to a small cubicle with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> on the side and
rendered powerless to influence its environment. (Nor is it obvious <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>,
when many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 hours</TIMEX> a week in day care, that they need extra autonomy
training.) I'd be willing to look at the evidence behind this claim, but there
isn't any. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Comparing Ferberized</ENAMEX> with non-Ferberized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> as they grow up would
tell us nothing--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferberizing</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ferberizing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> no doubt tend to have
broadly different approaches to child-rearing, and they probably have different
cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">milieus</ENAMEX>. We can't control our variables.

            Lacking data, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Brazelton</ENAMEX> make
creative assertions about what's going on inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferber</ENAMEX> says
that if you let a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toddler</ENAMEX> sleep between you and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX>, "in a sense
separating the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of you, he may feel too powerful and become worried." Well,
he may, I guess. Or he may just feel cozy. Hard to say (though they certainly
look cozy). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brazelton</ENAMEX> tells us that when a child wakes up at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and
you refuse to retrieve her from the crib, "she won't like it, but she'll
understand." Oh.

            According
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferber</ENAMEX>, the trouble with letting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> who fears sleeping alone into your
bed is that "you are not really solving the problem. There must be a reason why
he is so fearful." Yes, there must. Here's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>. Maybe your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s
brain was designed by natural selection over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> during which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> slept with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>. Maybe back then if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> found themselves
completely alone at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> it often meant something horrific had happened--the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX> had been eaten by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beast</ENAMEX>, say. Maybe the young brain is designed to
respond to this situation by screaming frantically so that any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> within
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">earshot</ENAMEX> will discover the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. Maybe, in short, the reason that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> left
alone sound terrified is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> left alone naturally get terrified. Just a
theory.

            
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Afew weeks</TIMEX> of nightly terror presumably won't
scar a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> for life. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Humans</ENAMEX> are resilient, by design. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferber</ENAMEX>'s gospel
harms <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, it's more likely doing so via a second route: the denial of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Breast milk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> are finding, is a
kind of "external placenta," loaded with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> masterfully engineered to
assist development. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> study found that it boosts IQ.

            
Presumably most breast-feeding benefits can be delivered via <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime</TIMEX> nursing.
Still, we certainly don't know that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an 11-hour</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nightly</TIMEX> gap in the
feeding schedule isn't doing harm. And we do know that such a gap isn't part of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nature</ENAMEX>'s plan for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-month-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>--at least, to judge by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter</ENAMEX>-gatherer
societies. Or to judge by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> itself: It is thin and watery--typical of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> frequently. Or to judge by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>: Failing to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> at
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> can lead to painful engorgement or even <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> infection. Meanwhile, as
all available evidence suggests that nighttime feeding is natural, Ferber
asserts the opposite. If after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months of age</TIMEX> your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby wakes</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and
wants to be fed, "she is developing a sleep problem."


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferberism</ENAMEX> is a good example of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. As "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> bed"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boosters</ENAMEX> have noted, male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, who have no idea what motherhood is like,
have cowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> into doing unnatural and destructive things. For a
while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> shouldn't feed more than once every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours</TIMEX>. Now
they admit they were wrong. For a while they pushed bottle feeding. Now they
admit this was wrong. For a while they told pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to keep weight gains
minimal (and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> did so by smoking more cigarettes!). Wrong again. Now
they're telling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> to deny food to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all night</TIMEX> long once the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months old</TIMEX>.

            There are signs that yet
another well-advised retreat is underway. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferber</ENAMEX> hasn't put out the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">white</ENAMEX> flag, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brazelton</ENAMEX> is sounding less and less dismissive of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who sleep
with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. (Not surprisingly, the least dismissive big-name child-care
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penelope Leach</ENAMEX>.) Better late than never. But in child care,
as in the behavioral sciences generally, we could have saved ourselves a lot of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and trouble by recognizing at the outset that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, and
pondering the implications of that fact.
