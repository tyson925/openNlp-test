            I've been through security
countless times at countless places, and I pride myself on wasting the least
amount of time. This requires that I be fully cooperative. I am also a private
pilot, and so I can affect a pretty good "yes, sir, yes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ma'am</ENAMEX>" style of snappy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">camaraderie</ENAMEX>. When airport security is tightened, and everyone is being asked,
"<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> I look into this bag, please?" I reply happily, "You bet, sir! Let me open
it for you!"

            On a
recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, I picked up my prepaid, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> round-trip tickets <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX>
before departure, without any check-in luggage. The ticketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> told me
that my carry-ons would be searched, and that I needed to obtain a signature
from security on an attached label in order to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>. I said, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Yes ma'am</ENAMEX>, no
problem." I thought, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> must be really tight <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>."

            With no lines at security, I got through in record time. My
bags got <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X-rayed</ENAMEX>, and my level of whatever those portals you walk through
measure was determined to be under the threshold. I must be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> with the
lowest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX> content in the history of air travel. I do not even carry small
change. (I am practical.) So I asked the security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, "What about the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">signature?</ENAMEX>" A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> appeared, quickly signed while avoiding my naively
friendly gaze, and handed me to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Junior</ENAMEX>, who then proceeded--methodically, if
not neatly--to unpack everything I was carrying, and to toss my clothes,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">toiletries</ENAMEX>, etc., into a dirty bin nearby.

            Then it
hit me. It was not that security was especially tight: It was only me
they wanted. And that "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">May I?</ENAMEX>" polite foreplay had gone out the window. The
label my friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hometown</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airline</ENAMEX> had affixed to my bags had unexpectedly made
me a marked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, someone selected for some unknown special treatment. The
routine was broken; the power had shifted; the violation had begun. I suddenly
felt as if in the grip of a giant vise, a terrible feeling I had last
experienced as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-ager</ENAMEX> before fleeing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>.

            
When I recount this story to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, this is
where they start to smile, as if a diagnosis of my condition had suddenly
become apparent. After all, if someone with post-traumatic stress disorder
jumped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> feet in the air every time a door slammed shut, good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> would be
more concerned about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s condition, not the door. In a like manner, my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> may suspect I am suffering from some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Refugee Syndrome</ENAMEX>, which
makes me overly sensitive to perfectly reasonable intrusions by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.

            I try to
explain: The communism I had fled was hardly traumatic or violent. One aspect
of the horrible vise was the constant minor humiliations I had to suffer, such
as interaction with the block warden, the party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">overlord</ENAMEX> of a block of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>,
who had to give his assent to all matters tiny or grand, including travel. On
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this Friday</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, I was being singled out for an unusual and
humiliating search. My personal goal was to fly to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> for a meeting
that was important to me. If I had refused the search--cried "NO!" as it
were--I assume they would have let me go home, but I would have been forbidden
to board the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> and would have missed my meeting. So I did what I had done
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years ago</TIMEX>: I chose to be humiliated just so I could reach my goal.

            I've just had my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> physical for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>'s license. It is
a thorough search for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> and disabilities. I knew what it would entail,
why they do it, and that everybody is treated the same way. I had no problem
with that.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>-security search
took <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about six minutes</TIMEX>. Junior kept up an awkward canned patter, assuring me
that I would be a safer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> for this and that he understood my anger. I
mumbled a lie about how I was not angry with him personally. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First I</ENAMEX> attempted
to hang onto my dignity by being passive. However, as time stretched out, I
found myself cooperating to get it over with.

            I
collected my clothes from the bin, my tie from the floor. I was free to go to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.A.</ENAMEX>

            The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX>, I found the Note in the return-ticket
envelope. Of course, it had been there from the beginning, slipped in by the
ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. But who reads those inserts next to the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Limitations on Baggage</ENAMEX>
Liability"? The salient paragraphs from the Note:

            
               Why was
I chosen?
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Passengers</ENAMEX>
are selected both randomly and through an objective systematic approach based
on direction from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>.

            
               How can
I avoid this in the future?
            

            Please understand that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Regulations</ENAMEX> prohibit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXXX Airlines</ENAMEX>, and all other air
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> from sharing specific information regarding this program with the
public.

            Who could
be against an "objective systematic approach" (except for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventor</ENAMEX> of the
automatic buzzword generator that gives us terms like "synchronized synergistic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>")? What does "based on" mean? Is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airline</ENAMEX> just following orders, or
is it adding its own fantasies? And as to what one can do to avoid this
treatment in the future (good question!), the pamphlet is clear: nothing.

            The following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, I had to fly to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX> again, this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> with an associate. I decided against carry-ons. I still felt like a total
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paranoiac</ENAMEX> when I repacked the contents of my soft carry-on bag into a hard-case
bag to check in, and when I asked my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX> to do the same. But I was
determined not to be humiliated again. And of course, we flew Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airline</ENAMEX>.
At curbside check-in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> noticed my one-way ticket. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Uh-oh</ENAMEX>. "We'll have to
check it inside." Surprise!

            "Both of you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> have been
tagged by the computer."

            "What does this mean? Why?" I
asked innocently.

            "It is a random selection by
the computer," came the reply.

            "I do not believe it is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX>," I opined with conviction.

            "Sir, I assure you it is
completely random," said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> quite sincerely, adding for reassurance,
"Why, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half an hour ago</TIMEX> [the computer] tagged a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who could barely walk."

            "But what does it mean to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">tagged?</ENAMEX>" we asked again.

            "You have to identify your
carry-ons!" the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> ordered.

            "We have none," we said
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triumphantly</ENAMEX>.

            "In that case you do not have
a problem."

            My
associate was impressed by my prescience, and we both felt free and in control
as we walked off with our hands in our pockets, carrying <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only a few dollars</NUMEX>,
the boarding card, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>'s license. We had a great day. I felt much
better: I was not completely paranoid. I fit the profile. But a profile of
what? I could not even begin to imagine.

            
My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX> was returning before me. Early
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> there was a phone message from him. "I am calling you from the
gate. I've been tagged again and this time, they wanted to search my check-in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">luggage</ENAMEX>. I was livid and made a big scene. They relented and bypassed the
computer." I am a shaggy-looking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> with a foreign accent. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX> is an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reservist</ENAMEX> who has the bearing of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Iceman" in Top Gun</ENAMEX> . What
profile does he fit?

            I returned to my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hometown</ENAMEX>
later, using another form of transportation.
