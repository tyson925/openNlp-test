            Back when I was a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX>--before I became a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> of digital content--I thought life would
always be simple: I would write articles, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would pay to read them.
But then I heard about the impending death of intellectual property, a scenario
painted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cyberfuturists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Perry Barlow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Esther Dyson</ENAMEX>. As all media move
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">online</ENAMEX>, they say, content will be so freely available that getting paid to
produce it will be hard, if not impossible. At first, I dismissed this as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">garden-variety</ENAMEX>, breathless overextrapolation from digerati social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorists</ENAMEX>.
But even as I scoffed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barlow-Dyson</ENAMEX> scenario climbed steadily toward the
rank of conventional wisdom.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barlow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dyson</ENAMEX> do have a
solution. In the future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like me, having cultivated a following by
providing free content on the Web, will charge our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">devotees</ENAMEX> for services that
are hard to replicate en masse. We will answer individual questions online,
say, or go around giving speeches, or spew out insights at private seminars, or
(this one is actually my idea) have sex with young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>. The key, writes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barlow</ENAMEX>, will be not content but "performance." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barlow</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lyricist</ENAMEX> for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grateful Dead</ENAMEX>, offers this analogy: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dead</ENAMEX> let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> tape concerts, and
the tapes then led more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to pay for the concerts.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seminal</ENAMEX> version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barlow-Dyson</ENAMEX> thesis is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barlow</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>-word <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> essay
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wired</ENAMEX> . It is with some trepidation that I challenge the logic of this
argument. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barlow</ENAMEX> is a noted visionary, and he is famously derisive of people
less insightful than himself (a group which, in his opinion, includes roughly
everyone). He says, for example, that the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> to deal correctly
with cyberissues depends on the "depth of the presiding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX>'s
clue-impairment." Well, at the risk of joining <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barlow</ENAMEX>'s long roster of the
clue-impaired, here goes.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barlow</ENAMEX>'s argument begins with a cosmic premise: "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>
technology is detaching information from the physical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>, where property law
of all sorts has always found definition." This is wrong on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> counts. First,
all information does take physical form. Whether digital or analog, whether in
ink or sound waves or synaptic firings or electrons, information always resides
in patterns of matter or energy (which, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einstein</ENAMEX> noted, are interchangeable
manifestations of the physical world).

            To be
sure, the significance of information is independent of its particular
physical incarnation. So is its value. You download this article from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">servers</ENAMEX> and copy it onto your own hard disk, and it's still worth--well,
nothing, but that's a . Suppose it were a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> video: You'd get just as much
enjoyment out of it regardless of which particular bunch of electrons embodied
it.

            

               B >ut this independence of meaning and value from physical incarnation
is nothing new. It is as old as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sumerian tablets</ENAMEX>, to say nothing of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gutenberg</ENAMEX> press. Indeed, the whole reason intellectual-property law exists is
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can acquire your information without acquiring the particular
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physical</ENAMEX> version of it that you created. Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barlow</ENAMEX>'s belief that "property
law of all sorts" has always "found definition" on the "physical plane" signals
a distressing confusion on his part. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sense in which it's true that
information is "detached" from the "physical plane"--the fact that
information's value transcends its physical incarnation--not only fails to
qualify as an original insight, and not only fails to make
intellectual-property rights obsolete; it's the very insight that led to
intellectual-property rights in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place! Barlow announces from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mountaintop</ENAMEX>: "It's fairly paradigm warping to look at information through fresh
eyes--to see how very little it is like pig iron or pork bellies." Maybe so,
but it's hard to say for sure, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who really did take that fresh
look have been dead for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>.

            If you somehow forced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barlow</ENAMEX>
to articulate his thesis without the wacky metaphysics, he'd probably say
something like this: The cost of copying and distributing information is
plummeting--for many purposes, even approaching <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can
now do it right at their desks. So in principle, content can multiply like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fruit</ENAMEX> flies. Why should anyone buy an article when a copy can be had for
nothing?

            Answer: Because it can't.
The total cost of acquiring a "free" copy includes more than just the
copying-and-transmitting costs. There's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the cost--in time and/or money--of
finding someone who already has a copy, and will give it to you for free or for
cheap; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the risk of getting caught stealing intellectual property; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) any
premiums you pay to others for incurring such risks (as when you get copies
from bootleggers); and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) informal punishments such as being labeled a cheat or
a cheapskate. The size of this last cost will depend on how norms in this area
evolve.

            Even in
the distant future, the total cost of cheating on the system, thus figured,
will almost never be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. Yes, it will be way, way closer to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> than it used
to be. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barlow-Dyson</ENAMEX> scenario still is wrong. Why? Because whether
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> cheat doesn't depend on the absolute cost of cheating. It depends on the
cost of cheating compared with the cost of not cheating. And the cost of
getting data legally will plummet roughly as fast as the cost of getting it
illegally--maybe faster.
            

            In their writings, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barlow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dyson</ENAMEX> make clear they're
aware of this fact. But they seems unaware of its fatal impact on their larger
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thesis</ENAMEX>. How could cybersages have such a blind spot? One theory: Because
they're cyber <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sages</ENAMEX>. You have to be a career paleohack like me, getting
paid for putting ink on paper, to appreciate how much of the cost of legally
acquiring bits of information goes into the ink and paper and allied
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anachronisms</ENAMEX>, like shipping, warehousing, and displaying the inky paper. I
wrote a book that costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$14</NUMEX> in paperback. For each copy sold, I get <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1</NUMEX>. The day
may well come, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barlow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dyson</ENAMEX> seem to believe, when book <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> as we
know them will disappear. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> will download books from Web sites and either
print them out on new, cool printers or read them on superlight wireless
computers. But if so, it will then cost you only <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1</NUMEX>--oh hell, make it <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.25</NUMEX>--to
get a copy of my book legally from my Web site.

            Now
imagine being at my Web site, reading my promotional materials, and deciding
you'd like to read the book. (Thank you.) A single keystroke will give you the
book, drain your bank account of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> shiny <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarters</TIMEX>, and leave you feeling
like an honest, upstanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX>. Do you think you'll choose, instead, to
call a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> in hopes of scoring an illegal copy? And don't imagine that
you can just traipse on over to the "black-market book <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>" section of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> and find a hot copy of my book. As in the regular world, the easier it is
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX> Consumer to track down an illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">distributor</ENAMEX>, the easier it is for
cops to do the same. Black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marketeers</ENAMEX> will have to charge enough to make up for
this risk, making it hard to undersell my <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.25</NUMEX> by much. And there are , too,
why the cost of cheating will be nontrivial.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M ></ENAMEX>eanwhile, on the other side of the ledger, there's another reason
for the cost of legal copies to drop. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> will reach a much larger
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> on the Web than they do now. The "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>" model of bringing
information to the attention of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> is stunningly inefficient. I hope it's
not egotistical of me to think that when I write an article for, say, the
New 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX> , I am not reaching nearly everyone who might have an
interest in it. Granted, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> is not yet a picture of efficiency itself.
Search engines, for example, are in the reptilian phase of their evolution. But
most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>--certainly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barlows</ENAMEX> of the world--expect radical improvement.
(I'm not saying all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> will see their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> grow. The likely
trend, when you , will be for many obscure and semiobscure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> to see
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> grow, while the few rich and famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> will see their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences shrink</ENAMEX>. Cool.)

            One
much-discussed cybertrend is especially relevant here: the scenario in which
various data brokers offer a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Daily Me</ENAMEX>," a batch of articles tailored to your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tastes</ENAMEX>, cheaply gleaned from all over the Web. When this happens, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> like me
will be living the life of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riley</ENAMEX>. We will wake up at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX>, stumble over to the
keyboard in our pajamas, hammer out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> words, and then--without talking to a
single bothersome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>--make our work available to all data <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX>. Likely
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> of my article will be shown, say, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first couple of paragraphs</TIMEX>. If they
want to read more, they deposit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a quarter</TIMEX>. Will you try to steal a copy
instead? Do you steal Tootsie pops at checkout <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counters</ENAMEX>? The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> and the
electronic cash service will pocket a dime of that. I take my <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15 cents</NUMEX> and head
for the liquor store.

            Of course, this "disaggregation of content" may be ruinous
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>. But consider the upside. Not only will the efficiency
of the system permit rock-bottom pricing that discourages cheating, but the
fluidity of content will disrupt channels of potential cheating. If you
subscribe to a regular, old-fashioned online <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, it's easy to split the
cost of a subscription with a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and furtively make copies. (You
wretched scum.) But if you subscribe to the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Daily Me</ENAMEX>," this arrangement makes
no sense, because every <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Me</ENAMEX> is different. Sure, you may e-mail a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> the
occasional article from your "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Me</ENAMEX>." (You wretched scum.) And, in general, this
sort of "leakage" will be higher than in pre-Web <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. But it would have to
reach massive proportions to negate the overall gains in efficiency that will
keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like me in business.

            This argument, like all
arguments about the future, is speculative. It may even be wrong. But it is
consistent with the history of the world. The last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-millennium has seen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> getting cheaper and easier to copy; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) data-creation occupying a
larger and larger fraction of all economic activity. Thus far, in other words,
as the realm of information has gotten more lubricated, it has become
easier , not harder, to make a living by generating information.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyberspace</ENAMEX> is essentially a quantum leap in lubrication.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barlow</ENAMEX>'s insistence that
intellectual property will soon be worthless is especially puzzling since he is
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the biggest troubadours of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third Wave</ENAMEX> information economy. Sometimes
he seem to think it's possible for a sector of a market economy to get bigger
and bigger even while the connection between work and reward in that sector
breaks down. He writes: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humanity</ENAMEX> now seems bent on creating a world economy
primarily based on goods that take no material form. In doing so, we may be
eliminating any predictable connection between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creators</ENAMEX> and a fair reward for
the utility or pleasure others may find in their works." Far out, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.
