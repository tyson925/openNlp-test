            A stickup <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> shoves a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith & Wesson</ENAMEX> in your face: Your money or your life, he says, by which he
means you can surrender your money or you can surrender your slightly bloody
money and your life.

            Compare
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gunman</ENAMEX>'s direct approach with the "voluntary standards" shakedown practiced
by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has demanded--I
mean, requested--that the computer industry voluntarily accept its encryption
standards. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> also made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> out of the TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>,
imploring them to rate TV programs to reflect sexual content and violence. (All
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>--except <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BET</ENAMEX>--submitted meekly.) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last October</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> persuaded a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">firearms</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> to voluntarily supply trigger
locks with new handguns. So much for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX>'s thesis that political power grows
out of the barrel of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX>.

            Why is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> so keen on seeking voluntary
standards in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place? Why doesn't it just pass laws or issue
regulations instead? It would if it could. Usually, the request for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>
signals the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s recognition--or at least suspicion--that it lacks the
legal authority to force industry or others to bend to its will. It doesn't
want to seek that authority either because it doubts it can muster the
necessary votes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> or because the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> stands in the way.

            The war on
tobacco offers the most telling example of this sort of extralegal extortion.
While negotiating the tobacco settlement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> wanted
desperately to bar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Tobacco</ENAMEX> from advertising its products. The First
Amendment prevents the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> from stopping the tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> from
advertising, however, so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators</ENAMEX> worked out a deal. Limit advertising,
and we'll cap your liability lawsuits. Fearing that ultimately the tort lawyers
would bankrupt them, the tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> agreed to give up their
constitutional ace in the hole. Only when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> reneged on the immunity side
of the deal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this spring</TIMEX> did the industry unvolunteer its <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX>
surrender.

            
Another reason the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> prefers
coercion--I mean, persuasion--over legislation is that a law formalizes the
power relationship between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and the governed. A law provides the
governed with the independent venue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> for whatever arguments might
unfold. The last word a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrat</ENAMEX> wants to hear from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> about a new
regulation is "unconstitutional."

            Yet
another advantage: Laws can be repealed, but voluntary standards are forever.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram Co.</ENAMEX> learned this lesson the hard way <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> when it abandoned the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>-long voluntary agreement to keep liquor ads off television. Rep.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Kennedy II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX>, responded by introducing the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Just Say No Act</ENAMEX>,"
banning the ads outright. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Observers</ENAMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>'s bill little chance of
passing, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> found itself flummoxed anyway. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> and most
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stations</ENAMEX> refused to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> air time because they feared liquor ads would
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prod Congress</ENAMEX> into investigating the proliferation of beer ads on television.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Millions</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars</NUMEX> of ad revenue would be lost if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> chose to regulate
beer ads or, worse yet, proposed new voluntary standards.

            Some industries embrace voluntary standards as a way to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dodge</ENAMEX> more onerous government regulation. Currently, commercial Web publishers
think they've staved off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Trade Commission</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> by establishing
voluntary privacy standards for online <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. (
                  Slate
                is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>. Click here to read its privacy statement.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTC</ENAMEX> completed a survey of
Web policies and practices and will deliver its report to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>.
Other industries, especially pharmaceutical and medical-device <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, love
to wear voluntary regs as a beard and use them to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> out the competition. "Oh,
look, we're in compliance with the voluntary regulations, but <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Company X</ENAMEX>
isn't."

            But bowing to voluntary
standards doesn't automatically get a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s hook,
either. When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> found themselves either strangled or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">entrapped</ENAMEX> in the rungs of their bunk beds, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> furniture industry and
the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consumer Product Safety Commission</ENAMEX> worked together to establish a
set of voluntary safety standards. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> agreed on guardrail design
standards and provided warning notices for the proper use of the beds (such as
not letting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> younger than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> use them). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPSC</ENAMEX> presented the industry
with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commendation for Product Safety</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> for its cooperation, and
commission <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chairwoman Ann Brown</ENAMEX> boasted about its relationship with the bed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>. "We are a regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>," she said, "but we prefer to work
voluntarily with industry."

            Today, the
industry probably regrets having cooperated. Even though <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> of all new
bunk beds sold conform to the voluntary standards, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsday</ENAMEX> reported last
month that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> is now recommending mandatory
standards. Mandatory standards enlarge government power to penalize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> who
don't abide by the rules and also give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Customs</ENAMEX> the right to reject imports
that don't conform. Having previously agreed to voluntary standards, the
furniture industry finds itself stuck in the regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maw</ENAMEX>. No wonder the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> thing you learn in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> is to never volunteer.

            
The corrupting thing about compulsory
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">voluntarism</ENAMEX> is that it preys on the high-minded to the benefit of the
unscrupulous. It turns government suggestions into veiled threats and devalues
true voluntarism. At its worst, it can kick up a stench that would have made
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Orwell</ENAMEX> gag.

            In fact, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> had a
name for this sort of voluntarism: subbotnik , the voluntary day of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">labor</ENAMEX>. Invented by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenin</ENAMEX>, subbotniks were convened on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> for
cleaning, maintenance, and construction projects that the commissars decided
needed attention. Since communism closed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>
have disappeared.
