            Surely you've known couples
like this: They have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and are undecided about having a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>. They
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lean</ENAMEX> one way and then the other; they weigh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros</ENAMEX> and cons; and finally,
they decide to go ahead. Then from the instant that <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is born, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> love it so deeply that they'd gladly sacrifice all their assets to
preserve its life.

            Compare
that with the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> shop for appliances or furniture or compact discs.
Generally speaking, if you know you're going to treasure something, you don't
hesitate to buy it. By contrast, the CDs you waver over, though sometimes
surprisingly good, are often unsurprisingly forgettable--and on average
unlikely to be cherished. Why, then, are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> so different?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> maintains that there's no real
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inconsistency</ENAMEX> here. He says it's wrong to think of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> as the equivalent of
a microwave oven; instead, you should think of it as the equivalent of an
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">addictive drug</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> hesitate about whether to try <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX>, but once they try
it, they become addicted and can't give it up. Likewise with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>.

            But that,
I think, is a very bad analogy, because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addicts</ENAMEX> tend to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who
believed at the outset that they could escape addiction. Perhaps that's because
they're foolish, or perhaps it's because they're high-stakes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gamblers</ENAMEX>, but that
is what they were thinking. (Why else would we hear so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addicts</ENAMEX> recounting
their experiences with the phrase "if only I had known ..."?) That's not true
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> know in advance, and with near certainty, that they will be
addicted to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. They choose their addiction with eyes wide open,
just like a customer choosing a microwave oven.

            
Moreover--and here is the key difference
between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addicts</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> know in advance, with near
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">certainty</ENAMEX>, that they won't want to break their addiction. If you've already got
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and are wavering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over a third</NUMEX>, then you've already got a pretty good
idea of what parenthood is like, and you already know that, unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addict</ENAMEX>
who despises his addiction, you're going to treasure your attachment to your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. When you know you're going to love something that much after you've
got it, how can you hesitate about getting it in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place?

            But as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> of an only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, I can verify that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do behave that way. I
know that my unconceived <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> would be my most valuable "possessions" if I
brought them to fruition, yet I've chosen to leave them unconceived.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Iam</ENAMEX> inclined to conclude that nobody--including me--has a
coherent way of thinking about how to make decisions that appropriately reflect
emotional and moral attachments to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are not yet born. The resulting
confusion makes it almost impossible to resolve important questions of public
policy.

            For
example, the following question seems to me to be of both supreme importance
and supreme difficulty: Do living <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have any moral obligation to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trillions</ENAMEX> of potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who will never have the opportunity to live
unless we conceive them?

            
The answer is surely either "yes" or "no," but
either answer leads to troubling conclusions. If the answer is "yes," then it
seems to follow that we are morally obliged to have more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> than we
really want. The unconceived are like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> being held in a sort of limbo,
unable to break through into the world of the living. If they have rights, then
surely we are required to help some of them escape.

            (In an
earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> column, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Be Fruitful and Multiply</ENAMEX>," I argued that we should reproduce more
quickly because it would improve living standards for existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Here I
am raising the entirely separate question of whether we should reproduce more
quickly in order to give life to potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.)

            But if the answer is "no"--if we have no obligations to
those imprisoned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souls</ENAMEX>--then it seems there can be no moral objection to our
trashing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>, to the point where there will be no future generations. (That's
not to say that we'd necessarily want to trash <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>; we might have selfish
reasons for preserving it. I mean to say only that if we ever did want to trash
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Earth</ENAMEX>, it would be morally permissible.) If we prevent future generations from
being conceived in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place, and if the unconceived don't count as moral
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>, then our crimes have no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>, so they're not true crimes.

            So if the unconceived have
rights, we should massively subsidize population growth; and if they don't have
rights, we should feel free to destroy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>. Either conclusion is disturbing,
but what's most disturbing of all is that if we reject <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, it seems we are
forced to accept the other. Perhaps there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> way, and that's just to
admit that we're incapable of being logically rigorous about issues involving
the unconceived.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Baxter</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anchorman</ENAMEX> on
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Tyler Moore</ENAMEX> 
               Show , planned to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in the
hopes that one of them would grow up to be a creative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> who could solve
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> problem. Right now, I'd settle for a creative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> who could
teach us how to think about the population problem. I hope the next generation
is large enough to include that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>.
