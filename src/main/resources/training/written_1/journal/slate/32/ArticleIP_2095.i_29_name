            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 24</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kingdome</ENAMEX> witnessed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most dramatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX>-hitter
confrontations since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Johnson</ENAMEX> faced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Babe Ruth</ENAMEX>. On the mound, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mariner</ENAMEX>'s Big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Unit</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>'-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy Johnson</ENAMEX>, the tallest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> ever to play in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">majors</ENAMEX>, and the most proficient strikeout <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX> in history. At the plate,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark McGwire</ENAMEX>, the best and strongest home-run <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hitter</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth</ENAMEX>.

            Although
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX> whiffed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGwire</ENAMEX> twice on the way to a record-breaking total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">strikeouts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGwire</ENAMEX> hit what was estimated as the longest home run in at least
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX>. He got all of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">97-mph</NUMEX> fastball, and launched it at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">105 mph</NUMEX> in the
general direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>.

            On the radio, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mariner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Niehaus</ENAMEX> marveled, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A</ENAMEX>
high fly ball, belted, and I mean belted , deep to left field, into the
upper deck! My, oh my, what a shot by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark McGwire</ENAMEX>! That is probably the
longest home run ever hit here. ... It will be interesting to see how far that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ball</ENAMEX> will be guesstimated. ... We have often wondered if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGwire</ENAMEX> got ahold of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy Johnson</ENAMEX> fastball how far he could hit it, and I think we just saw
it."

            Shortly
after, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niehaus</ENAMEX> gave the estimated distance: "<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">538 feet</NUMEX>--unbelievable, absolutely
unbelievable. The longest home run ever hit here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> ... the longest
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> run I think I have ever seen hit." Not only that, it seems to be the
longest ball hit since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, when the distance of major-league home runs was
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> estimated on a wide scale. Sports pages and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broadcasters</ENAMEX> across the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> are still heralding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGwire</ENAMEX>'s homer as one of the great feats in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slugging</ENAMEX> history.

            
But there's a catch: The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">538-feet</NUMEX> figure,
announced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mariners</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 40 seconds</TIMEX> after the ball landed, was an
overstatement worthy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P.T</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnum</ENAMEX>. According to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicists</ENAMEX> who have
worked independently and have written extensively on the science of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>,
the human limit for hitting a baseball at sea level, under normal temperatures
and with no wind, is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">somewhere between 450</NUMEX> feet and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">470 feet</NUMEX>.

            Curious
that anyone could hit a ball <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">538 feet</NUMEX> in an indoor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> near sea level, I
called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mariners</ENAMEX> to see how they devised such a spectacular number. The team
repeatedly refused to explain how they arrived at the figure or to allow me to
speak to whoever made the estimate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mariners PR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Aust</ENAMEX> stresses
that the figure is "a guesstimate." "We don't really believe in the process,"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aust</ENAMEX> says, distancing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGwire</ENAMEX> number.

            That "process" has evolved over time. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>
established the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tale of the Tape</ENAMEX>" program, devising a system by which home-run
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distances</ENAMEX> could be estimated. Sponsorship of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Major League Baseball</ENAMEX>-licensed
program was assumed by telecom giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> and redubbed the "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI Home Run</ENAMEX>
Program." The program's Web site lists the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> longest home runs of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> and
provides a searchable database of the home runs of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous two years</TIMEX>.

            "We do not
measure the home runs," says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cal Jackson</ENAMEX>. The distances are
estimated by the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> and then provided to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX>. "We act as a
warehouse for the numbers that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Major League Baseball</ENAMEX> sends us."

            
Unsatisfied with the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">538-feet</NUMEX> number, I did my
own figuring. I consulted the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX> Kingdome blueprints, a more recent
laser-survey diagram of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seattle Times</ENAMEX> game story,
and visited the park twice. Here are the facts: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGwire</ENAMEX>'s homer landed in the
eighth row of the left side of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 240</ENAMEX> in the second deck--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">439</NUMEX> feet
(measured horizontally) from home plate and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">59 feet</NUMEX> above the playing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>.

            How much
further could the ball have gone? Based on a review of the trajectory charts in
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physics of Baseball</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Keep Your Eye on the Ball: The Science</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Folklore</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Baseball</ENAMEX> , conversations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puget Sound</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">physicist Andrew Rex</ENAMEX>, and correspondence with aerospace <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> and baseball
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Hawks</ENAMEX>, I determined that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGwire</ENAMEX> home run would have
traveled <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 474 feet</NUMEX>. A mighty home run, yes, but still <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">64 feet</NUMEX> short of the
length claimed.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rex</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawks</ENAMEX> agree that any home run hit that far must
approximate the "maximum-distance trajectory"--that is it can only be a high
fly or a normal fly, not a line drive. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGwire</ENAMEX>'s homer was a high fly, as
Niehaus attested, and as was confirmed by his broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Rizzs</ENAMEX>, who
marveled at the ball's hang time. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Major League Baseball</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, a high fly will descend at an angle whose cotangent is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX>. In
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trigonometry</ENAMEX>-for-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dummies</ENAMEX> terms, what that means is that for every foot the ball
would have continued to drop vertically, it would have traveled another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX>
feet horizontally. Here's the math: <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">439 feet</NUMEX> + (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">59 feet</NUMEX> x <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.6</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">474 feet</NUMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGwire</ENAMEX>'s
"<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">538</NUMEX>-footer" isn't the only questionable long ball of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI Web</ENAMEX>
site claims <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six 500-footers</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGwire</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockies</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andres Galarraga</ENAMEX>, hit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galarraga</ENAMEX>'s home run, originally
announced as <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">573 feet</NUMEX>, then revised at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">529 feet</NUMEX>, is listed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">529</NUMEX>
feet by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX>. By my calculations, it probably went <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 479 feet</NUMEX>. And yet
another reason to doubt the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> numbers: Apparently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM/MCI</ENAMEX> program
recorded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no 500</NUMEX>-footers from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988 to 1996</TIMEX>.

            
Don't get me wrong--all the homers listed on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> top-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> list were remarkable shots. And I'm not arguing that
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-footers are impossible. A few have been hit, but all were aided by
altitude, the elements, or both. The best-known of these, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mickey Mantle</ENAMEX>'s
mythical <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">565-foot</NUMEX> blast on a windy day at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Griffith Stadium</ENAMEX>,
probably traveled <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 506 feet</NUMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Physics of Baseball</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert K. Adair</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> Web site spells out
the intended method of measuring these home runs. "Distances are measured using
a grid system matched to each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ballpark</ENAMEX>'s unique parameters and configuration.
Each home run is estimated based on how far it would have traveled from home
plate on a horizontal line had it not been obstructed by something (seats,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fence</ENAMEX>, roof, foul pole, other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium parts</ENAMEX>, etc.)."

            If every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> worked
according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> plan, each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> would be accurately diagramed with a
fine-grained grid related to its seating sections, level by level. This would
tell the estimator how far the ball was from home plate when it landed in the
seats, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bullpen</ENAMEX>, or other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> area, and how high it was above field level
when it landed. (In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadiums</ENAMEX>, very few home runs touch the ground
before hitting something higher first.)

            Working
with the distance and height, the estimator would assess the ball's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trajectory</ENAMEX>--was it a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">liner</ENAMEX>? a normal fly? a high fly?--and use a formula to
determine the ultimate distance the ball would have traveled. Click for the
formula.

            In theory this is not a bad system, but in practice it's
not always fully observed. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> work from arcs rather than grids, making
the estimators' jobs more difficult. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> measure only to the point of
impact, rather than to the likely field-level landing point. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX> don't
have height data, and must estimate that dimension. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Sox</ENAMEX> can't see where
balls, hit beyond "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Monster</ENAMEX>" into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, land. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGwire</ENAMEX> had hit his
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> run in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX>, for example, it would have been measured at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 448</NUMEX>
feet under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orioles</ENAMEX>' point-of-impact house rules. Such departures make the
various major-league home-run distances inconsistent, and usually make them
less accurate as well.

            Major
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">League</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Courtney</ENAMEX> acknowledges that there have been questions
about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> program, and says that the measurement issue will be discussed at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">league PR</ENAMEX> meetings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</TIMEX> "so everyone will be on the same page for next
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>."

            
Let's hope so. <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Baseball</ENAMEX>, a game of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">inches</NUMEX> and
meticulous record-keeping, deserves accurate and consistent data, and these
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">awful</ENAMEX> numbers have already tainted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set of record books. Click for the
story. The pity is that the home-run-measurement program, as conceived by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, was never uniformly implemented. Now is the time for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX> and refine the system and for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Major League Baseball</ENAMEX> to ensure compliance
and train the estimators.

            After a period of
adjustment, during which many long home runs will seem puny, we'll slowly
reacclimate ourselves to reality. Weaned off the inflated estimates, numbers
that add <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 feet</NUMEX> to big home runs, we'll finally appreciate the majesty of a
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">440-footer.</TIMEX>
