            I was prodded into the
free-lance-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> business by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 19, 1987</TIMEX>, stock-market crash. Having
been employed as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> at a major media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conglomerate</ENAMEX> for many moons, I had
collected a substantial stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s profit-sharing plan. So when the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">508</NUMEX> points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX> and my stake shrank by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 20 percent</NUMEX>, I was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hysterical</ENAMEX>. But then I discovered something quite amazing about my
profit-sharing plan. Its rules stated that when you left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s employ,
your share got paid out at the values in effect at the end of the preceding
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX> . In other words, if I retired by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 31, 1987</TIMEX>, my payoff would be at
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 30</TIMEX> prices. Dazzled by this magical opportunity to sell at pre-crash
prices, I negotiated a contract with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bosses</ENAMEX> to continue scribbling on a
free-lance basis, and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 1</TIMEX>, I became a "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX>" of various editorial
materials.

            The first
thing a fellow notices after attaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX> status is that it is harder to
get paid in a timely fashion. As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>-employee, I had had my paychecks
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deposited</ENAMEX> instantly and automatically in my bank account. When I became a
contract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, I got paid only after somebody--initially it was a secretary
in the business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>--put in a requisition for my pay. This seemed odd
and unnecessarily complicated, since my new contract called for me to receive
the same amount <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first of the month</TIMEX>. It seemed doubly odd
when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> came where the secretary forgot to put the requisition through. Or,
alternatively, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> put the req through but then couldn't
remember whether the blessed event had taken place.

            To be fair, there was only one "did-we-pay-you-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this-month</TIMEX>?"
call. But my diary shows endless fretting and nagging on my part as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX>
or the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> or the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12 th</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month</TIMEX> arrived and the check did
not. The situation improved only marginally when the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> requisitions
ceased and my payment problems were essentially turned over to the corporate
Accounts Payable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>. The payments were still generally late, and once,
not having been paid as of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12 th</NUMEX> , I made the unsettling discovery
that I had somehow mysteriously dropped out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> payment program
altogether. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 1989</TIMEX>, apparently responding to my endless
lamentations about late payments, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> started paying me ahead of time, i.e., a
few <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> before the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month</TIMEX>. This was naturally fine with me until I
realized, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late in December</TIMEX>, that I was now in danger of getting a federal form
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1099</TIMEX> showing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> payments and requiring more taxes sooner. So I
complained about this prospect, and before long we were back to the default
situation: chronic late payment. I do not believe--or at least cannot
prove--that this signifies a cash-management play-the-float strategy by senior
accounting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>. And yet, there is this nagging question: Would Accounts
Receivable be as relaxed as Accounts Payable plainly is about money regularly
changing hands <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> or more later than had been contractually specified?

            Speaking
of form <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1099</TIMEX>, I have still not decided what to do about the one I got some
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> back from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>. I had yearned to write for this online <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>, and was
delighted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last fall</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Kinsley</ENAMEX> gave me a shot at an article.
It was about the huge losses taken by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX> bookmakers on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holyfield-Tyson</ENAMEX> fight,
and I was delighted all over again when the article was "posted" <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 22</TIMEX>, only
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days</TIMEX> after I had taken on the assignment. How fast it all goes online!
What a marvelous contrast to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">slowpoke</ENAMEX> print media! Except for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s
payment, which arrived on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 2, 1997</TIMEX>, in an envelope bearing a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 28, 1996</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postmark</ENAMEX>. The case law says, plain as day, that this is "constructive receipt"
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, and the question I face is whether a sane <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> should fight to
uphold this principle after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> business-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">side characters</ENAMEX> have
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nonchalantly</ENAMEX> stuck him with a form <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1099</TIMEX> showing those earnings as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>
income.

            
Free-lance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> must also deal with a lot of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paperwork</ENAMEX> and printed forms plainly designed with other kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> in
mind. These other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> are not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> sitting alone at home writing articles.
They are real <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, with legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> and human-resources
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">departments</ENAMEX>. And they are equipped to answer questions about the possibility
that the enterprise is a "small business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>" as defined by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 3</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Business Act</ENAMEX>--to mention only one of many thorny issues raised in a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-page form that landed on my desk <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks ago</TIMEX>.

            Leading
up to its arrival was a telephone query from an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of a financial journal
that had recently published some of my thoughts on the stock market: "Did we
ever send you the paperwork we need so we can pay you?" Naively assuming that
this would be a request for my mailing address and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> number, I
volunteered to provide this information right then and there, on the phone. But
no, the publisher of the financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>--again, it was a huge Fortune 500
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>--needed to know much, much more about me. A special toughie was the
request for my "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dun & Bradstreet SIC</ENAMEX> number." I assumed at first that this
was some variant of the "principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> or professional activity code" that
free-lancers are required to enter on federal Schedule C (where you report
"business profits").

            Like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of others in my line of work, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> at
tax time I wrestle with the issue of which four-digit number to write in on
this schedule, the instructions for which mention a huge number of
self-employment scenarios, none of them envisioning a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> creating copy in his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">den</ENAMEX>. Generally, I have ended up choosing No. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7880</TIMEX>, meaning that I provide
"other business services," which leaves me feeling somewhat marginalized but
looks as though it would at least be defensible in a showdown with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>. But
that was my four-digit code. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D&B</ENAMEX> codes, as I ascertained after
extensive cruising around on the Internet, had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight or</TIMEX> (in some accounts) <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine</TIMEX>
digits and provided much more detailed information about one's place in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX>. But how to find out one's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX>? Instructions that came with the form
counseled checking with "your tax <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>" or--an even less realistic option
for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> needing to get some work done--the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Administration</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, I brazenly sent the form back without any
D&B code, and one of these days I hope to get paid for my musings on the
market.

            As a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX>,
I get to pay city income taxes twice. It's incredible, and it works this way.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1099s</NUMEX> one garners during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> are of course cumulated and reported on
federal Schedule C, then carried over to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> state form IT-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">201</NUMEX>, which
takes you through the state and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> income-tax calculations. The
combined marginal rate for the state and city taxes was recently running around
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 percent</NUMEX>, which is bad enough. But when you have paid it all, the New York
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Department of Taxation and Finance</ENAMEX> taps you on a figurative shoulder,
reminds you that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> also has an <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Unincorporated Business Tax</ENAMEX>, and states
firmly that free-lance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> gotta pay this too. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">UBT</ENAMEX> covers the same
earned income paid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> on form IT-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">201</NUMEX>, and this time around, the bill
comes to a flat <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 percent</NUMEX> (after <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10,000</NUMEX> of deductions and exemptions).

            Not one employed journalist
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100</TIMEX> has even heard of this ghastly double dip or experienced the surge of
fury I felt when I called up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Authors</ENAMEX>' League in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> to ask why they
weren't screaming about it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> I spoke to coolly asked how much I made
as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, judged the amount too high to warrant condolences, and said I
should be glad to pay my share. She was obviously not a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX>.
