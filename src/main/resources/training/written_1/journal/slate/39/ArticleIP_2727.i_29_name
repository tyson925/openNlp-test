            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Enquirer</ENAMEX>
became part of the news when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> published a piece
recently about the story the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tabloid</ENAMEX> didn't run. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> hired <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> to stake out the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of a
Little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rock</ENAMEX> heiress rumored to be having an affair with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Independent Counsel</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> could find no evidence of a liaison, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> dropped the inquiry. It seems, however, that the whole episode
will have its day in court: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> has subpoenaed the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>. And
although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Kendall</ENAMEX> has also done legal work for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Coz</ENAMEX> denies that he got the tip through his
connections to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This week</TIMEX> the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enquirer</ENAMEX> seems to take a different tack on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>. Instead of a possible
adulterer, he is presented as less than a manly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. Embarrassing secrets about
his past are revealed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> who won't end up receiving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subpoenas</ENAMEX>: "his sweet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vannie</ENAMEX>." In its "exclusive" interview
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> extracts the information that as a boy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spoiled</ENAMEX> and temperamental and so "got a lot of spankings." This turned him
around and by junior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">high school</ENAMEX>, "his hobby was polishing shoes." (This
damning detail was reported earlier in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> .) Another hobby was
appearing in high-school variety shows, where he dressed as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>--the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> publishes a silly, but less than titillating, example of this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proclivity</ENAMEX>.

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth</ENAMEX>
didn't really start dating until after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX> reports, which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enquirer helpfully</ENAMEX> explains means "unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken</ENAMEX> was always the
kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who gave sex a low priority." We also find out that the heartbreak
of psoriasis possibly saved <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s life. The skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">condition</ENAMEX> got the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX>
War <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporter</ENAMEX> out of the draft. And with the wisdom of the aged, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vannie Starr</ENAMEX>
asks the question that now haunts the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, "Why can't the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> be
satisfied with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>?"

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> also warns that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX> is a "
'ticking time bomb' of self-destruction," at risk of either suicide or blimping
up, according to one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>'s favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychiatrists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carole</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lieberman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> does not say whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lieberman</ENAMEX>
is related to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evelyn Lieberman</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> who helped send <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> into
this spiral by transferring her from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> after she
showed inordinate interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>.

            The
Star weighs in on the scandal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> with a piece on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> unnamed
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> forced to give depositions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paula Jones</ENAMEX> lawsuit. The
Star says these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>--now in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s sights--have all publicly denied
sexual involvement with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, but under oath they told a different story.
But, says a source, "[t]he key to their testimony--and to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s--is the
definition of oral sex." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> also says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> is pursuing the
testimony of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> who, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of his recounts, says that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> he
was paid to "track down <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had sex and silence them" with
hush money.

            
In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> says that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infamous Donna Karan</ENAMEX> beret that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> wore as she hugged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> across a
rope line was sent by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> as a gift for first
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">daughter Chelsea</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, apparently unable to get away to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saks</ENAMEX> to purchase a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplicate</ENAMEX>, snagged the original and gave it to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX> as a gift.

            Despite
these tidbits, now, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than six weeks</TIMEX> into the scandal, it's clear that for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tabloids</ENAMEX> it does not have the enduring cover power of the murder of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JonBenet Ramsey</ENAMEX> or the sex life of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jackson</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> has been relegated
to ever smaller headlines in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent weeks</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> 's disinterest
in the whole matter is best summed up by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>'s coverage: none. All along,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> , usually the most prurient of the tabloids, has taken it upon
itself to be the voice of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. It consistently portrays
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> as a sex-crazed, unbalanced fantasist. Most cruelly, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>, for no
clear reason, it ran photos of a quite fat teen-age <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>. It also did a
perhaps ill-advised survey of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> who support the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. For
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">example Barbra Streisand</ENAMEX>, who the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> says is fearful of getting her
own subpoena because of a rumored affair with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, says, "We elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angie Dickinson</ENAMEX>, who is rumored to have had an
affair with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kennedy</ENAMEX>, says, "We shouldn't care what a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> does in his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bedroom</ENAMEX>." And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Nicholson</ENAMEX>, who makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> look like a castrato, says,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>, you're great. Keep on."

            OK, maybe political commentary is not a celebrity strong
suit. But, as the tabloids demonstrate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week after week</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> can be counted on
to get in violent disputes, have out-of-wedlock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and act
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bizarrely</ENAMEX>.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Just a few weeks ago</TIMEX>,
reported the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pamela Anderson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rocker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Lee</ENAMEX> were
contemplating a more professional follow-up to the bootleg video of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lovemaking</ENAMEX> session that swept the Internet. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, it appears it is not to be.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> reports <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Valentine's Day</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">getaway</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>, during which "a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">booze</ENAMEX>-crazed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Lee</ENAMEX> brutally beat his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>." Although their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> denied the story, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> has since been arrested
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson</ENAMEX> has filed for divorce.

            Celebrity
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> who don't want to know their out-of-wedlock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> and celebrity
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> who don't want to know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> of their out-of-wedlock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
have also been in the news. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> reports that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Jones</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh O'Brian</ENAMEX> have unacknowledged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX>. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> tells the
rather shaky story of a supposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marlon Brando</ENAMEX> whom the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> has
never seen. Female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> are causing a run on the sperm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, according to the
tabs. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jodie Foster</ENAMEX> is pregnant through
artificial insemination. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Performer Sandra Bernhard</ENAMEX> has also chosen the
anonymous route to motherhood, according the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> . And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX>, says
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> , is looking for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sperm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>, one for herself and one for
her "galpal" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingrid Casares</ENAMEX>.

            
Then there are the stories that make you think
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> just shouldn't be allowed to reproduce at all. Both the
Star and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> picked up reports from a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> about
the germ-free life of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jackson</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nanny</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> take turns watching the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> around the clock, although they
are not allowed to kiss him. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> gets new toys <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>, because used
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toys</ENAMEX> are immediately discarded. All eating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">utensils</ENAMEX> are first sterilized, then
thrown away after use, and young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> is not allowed to play with other
germ-ridden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.

            Soon
there will be an addition to this happy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Debbie</ENAMEX>,
who lives apart from her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, gives birth to their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>.
According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> plans to divorce her right after the
birth so he can reunite with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ex-wife</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Marie Presley</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX>
ran photographs of that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX>'s recent romantic and very public evening out in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. Throughout dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> wore a black silk surgical mask, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> was later pictured kissing tenderly through the mask. As longtime
tabloid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> know, the reason for the mask is that after innumerable
surgeries, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX>'s nose is collapsing like an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Niño</ENAMEX>-soaked hillside.

            Finally, some good news. Talk-show <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathie Lee Gifford</ENAMEX>
found out that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lump</ENAMEX> in her breast was benign. She shared this with her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> (along with the news that she's
approaching menopause and that her young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> walked in on her and her formerly
straying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Gifford</ENAMEX>, making love), because "I like to think of my
breasts as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s breasts."
