            The earliest smoking song
I've ever come across is "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tobacco</ENAMEX>'s But an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian Weed</ENAMEX>"--from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1600s</TIMEX>,
which seems a bit slow off the mark: Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Raleigh</ENAMEX> had brought the first
tobacco leaves back from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Elizabeth</ENAMEX> almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX>
earlier. On the other hand, he also brought back the potato, and how many great
potato songs had anybody written by then? But sooner or later everything winds
up in the ashtray of history and, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">300 years</TIMEX> after that first entry, it seems
almost certain that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cigarette Songbook</ENAMEX> has no new <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> to turn over. For
that reason alone, kd <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lang</ENAMEX>'s Drag will prove a useful anthropological
document, rounding up as it does some of the smokiest songs of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the century</TIMEX>,
from "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Smoke Rings</ENAMEX>," the old theme of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glen Gray</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa Loma Orchestra</ENAMEX> from
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1930s</NUMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Miller</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">'70s</NUMEX> rocker "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Joker</ENAMEX>" ("I'm a smoker, I'm a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">midnight</ENAMEX> toker").

            The first
thing to be said is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss lang</ENAMEX>--or maybe it's miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lang</ENAMEX>--lives up to her
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drag</ENAMEX> is a deep, languorous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhalation</ENAMEX>. Its orchestrations,
especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Tom</ENAMEX>'s guitar loops, are as near as anyone's ever come to the
sensation of smoking, even if by the time she gets halfway through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hollies</ENAMEX>'
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Air That I Breathe"</ENAMEX> (click to hear it)--"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace</ENAMEX> came upon me/ And it
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lee</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ee</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ee</NUMEX>-eaves me weak"--she seems to be unwinding from a heavy <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> at the
opium den rather than down to her last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marlboro Light</ENAMEX>.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> thing to be said is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drag</ENAMEX> is a pun:
On the cover, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lang</ENAMEX> is wearing pinstripes and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ruby cravat</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar Wilde</ENAMEX>
heading out clubbing. It's as much about sexual role play, and smoking as a
metaphor for love, every popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX>'s real addiction. (If any male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vocalist</ENAMEX>
is looking for an equally adroit album title encompassing both cigarettes and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sexuality</ENAMEX>, may I suggest, at least for those versed in the divergences of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slang</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fag .</ENAMEX>) Incidentally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilde</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Picture</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorian Gray</ENAMEX> , writes, "A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect
pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> unsatisfied. What more can one
want?" This would seem to be kd's view of love: an addiction that must
inevitably disappoint.

            In a way, it's the album she's been working up to for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. She's covered "I'm Down to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">My Last Cigarette" and "Three Cigarettes in</ENAMEX>
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ashtray</ENAMEX>" and, best of all, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Black Coffee"</ENAMEX> (click to hear it), a smoldering
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peggy Lee</ENAMEX> favorite that climaxes:

            Now <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> was born to go
a-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovin</ENAMEX>';But was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> born to weep and fret?And stay at home and tend her
ovenAnd drown her past regretsIn <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> and cigarettes?

            I'm moanin' all the
mornin'Moanin' all the nightAnd in between It's nicotine. ...

            You get the idea. (That,
by the way, is the first use of "nicotine" in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tin Pan Alley</ENAMEX> lyric.) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lang</ENAMEX>'s
best-known original song, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constant Craving</ENAMEX>," speaks for itself. Her
best-written song, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss Chatelaine</ENAMEX>" from the CD <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingenue</ENAMEX> , is about love
as an exhilarating high, and the next track on that album begins, "You swim
through my veins ..." Artistically speaking, kd <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lang</ENAMEX> is addicted to
addiction.

            She's not the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, of course. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Warren</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Dubin</ENAMEX>
covered most of the bases in a song for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> nd Street in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX>
(italics <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>):

            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ev'ry kiss</ENAMEX>, ev'ry hug

            Seems to act just like a
drug
            

            You're getting to be a habit
with me

            Let me stay in your arms

            I'm addicted to your
charms

            You're getting to be a habit
with me

            I used to think your love was
something that I

            Could take or leave alone

            But now I
couldn't live without my supply . ...

            Only in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the final eight</TIMEX>
bars do the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> pull any punches:

            I must have you ev'ry day

            As
regularly as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>. ...

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tea</ENAMEX> ? You mean,
after all that, we're talking about hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverages</ENAMEX> here? Well, probably.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coffee</ENAMEX>'s addictive; so are reefer (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cab Calloway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fats Waller</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">coke</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porter</ENAMEX>--"I get no kick from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>"). But, in most pop songs, cigarettes are
merely a stylish accessory.

            The best example of stylish smoke comes at the opening of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most recorded songs ever. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Maschwitz</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> radio producer
moonlighting under the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holt Marvell</ENAMEX>, wrote the lyric as an attempt to come
up with his own "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">You're the Top</ENAMEX>"-like laundry list. As it happens, I think he
improved on the original. His is one of the most quoted lines in all popular
music:

            A cigarette that bears a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lipstick</ENAMEX>'s tracesAn airline ticket to romantic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">placesAnd</ENAMEX> still my heart has
wingsThese foolish things Remind me of you. ...

            In the cold light of day,
it's an image that's as likely to make you feel icky as nostalgic--a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-smoked fag with some cheesy lip gloss on it. But, set to those notes, it's
a fine example of the transformational <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of music--the perfect opening
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maschwitz</ENAMEX>'s rueful accumulation of sophisticated memory-joggers--"wild
strawberries only <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">seven francs</NUMEX> a kilo," "the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waiters</ENAMEX> whistling as the last bar
closes," and so on.

            Since then, the singing cigarette has dwindled away to
isolated outposts of adolescent rock, like "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Smokin' in the Boys' Room</ENAMEX>." <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of
the consequences, for an album like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drag</ENAMEX> , is that the most innocuous
songs now, paradoxically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pack</ENAMEX> more of a punch than ostensibly more searing
stuff like "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">My Old Addiction</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kd lang</ENAMEX> is never more brazen than when dusting
off "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Smoke Rings"</ENAMEX> (click to hear it), from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1932</TIMEX>:

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puff</ENAMEX>! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puff</ENAMEX>! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puff</ENAMEX>!Puff your
cares awayPuff! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puff</ENAMEX>! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puff</ENAMEX>!<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Night and day</TIMEX> ...

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lang</ENAMEX>'s great quality is
that she can pull off even the most anachronistic trifle without patronizing
it. The songs emerge as charming and dated yet somehow contemporary. Her
approach, which she's used consistently since recording <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole Porter</ENAMEX>'s "So in
Love" <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years ago</TIMEX>, is to honor the broad parameters of the original
layout--tempo, arrangement--while using pared-down, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">guitar</ENAMEX>-based rock
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orchestrations</ENAMEX>. The only surprise is that more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singers</ENAMEX> haven't picked up on
it.

            I'd be interested to see if you could apply that technique
(and the arrangements) to older <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Herbert</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1905</TIMEX> nod to
Kipling, "(<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Woman Is Only a Woman</ENAMEX>) But a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Cigar Is a Smoke"</ENAMEX>--though that's
probably an unlikely sentiment for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kd lang</ENAMEX>. Still, it's these older songs that
seem the correct assessment: Smoking is a consolation for the vicissitudes of
life, a prop for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">losers</ENAMEX>. That's how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX>'s been using cigarettes for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, dimming the lights and getting them out for "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Angel Eyes" or "One for My</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Baby</ENAMEX>," sad songs for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> with nothing to do but drown their sorrows. It's a
persona that found its apotheosis in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX> on the cover of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">She Shot Me</ENAMEX>
Down , his darkest album: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX>, hunched in a leather jacket, wreathed in
smoke. It's not an image the tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> care for. When a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '60s</TIMEX>, tried the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saloon-singer</ENAMEX> approach in a TV ad--with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moody</ENAMEX>, reflective loner and the tag line "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">You're</ENAMEX> never alone with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strand</ENAMEX>"--it
wound up putting itself out of business. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Camel</ENAMEX> approach is unlikely to
produce any decent songs, but it undoubtedly sells more cigarettes.

            Whatever happens to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> sales under the new settlement
between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and the tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>--or, more accurately, between the
tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobbyists</ENAMEX> and some enterprising tort <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>--it's bound to result in
the further withdrawal of cigarettes from the mainstream of popular culture,
including songs. That being the case, maybe, like the fatalistic protagonist of
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1908</TIMEX> operetta <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algeria</ENAMEX> , we should light up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> last time:

            Fragrant
clouds then from us veilEv'ry sorrow, ev'ry doubtTill we wake at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last to</TIMEX>
findThat our cigarette is out.
