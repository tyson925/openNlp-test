            Cursed by long lead times,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tabloids</ENAMEX> missed the first turn in the sex-scandal news cycle. While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koppel</ENAMEX> speculated about whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> considered oral sex to be sex and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> reported the possible existence of a semen-stained dress, the
tabloid cover stories on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newsstands</ENAMEX> were: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Springer</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> ),
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JonBenet Ramsey</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> ), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jackson</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Enquirer</ENAMEX> ).
The big question <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> was: Could the tabs reclaim their territory--the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">depravity</ENAMEX> and hypocrisy of the celebrated--in the face of the onslaught from
the respectable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX>?

            The
answer is no, even though the tabs took out the checkbook to play catch-up.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Agent-provocateur</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucianne Goldberg</ENAMEX> refused the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 million</NUMEX> she said the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tabloids</ENAMEX> had bid for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX> tapes. (It's probably safe to assume
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> herself has turned down the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 million</NUMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Guccione</ENAMEX> offered
her to pose for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penthouse</ENAMEX> , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Post</ENAMEX> .) Even
though it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> , back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, that almost derailed Bill
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s candidacy with its revelation of his affair with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gennifer Flowers</ENAMEX>
("He introduced me to things I've never done before, like oral sex"), none of
the tabs came up with new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> or other bombshells this time. The most
provocative gossip of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two weeks</TIMEX> came from the normally speak-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no</NUMEX>-evil
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liz Smith</ENAMEX>, who reported that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> first came into office, a former
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> who kept in touch with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> told her that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> was
"totally out of control in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> when it came to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>." Does this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mean Nancy</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara</ENAMEX> will be testifying before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">grand jury</ENAMEX>?

            The most shocking tabloid news comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> ,
which thinks the alleged affair between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> is just so much
feverish fantasy. "According to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> close to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX>
reports, "the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">intern</ENAMEX>'s self-described sexual exploits could well be the female
equivalent of locker-room bragging." Then there's the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>'s re-creation
of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first couple</TIMEX>'s first conversation about the news. After <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> denounces
the initial story in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> , saying, "It's lie after lie!"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> declares, "We've got to fight back!" To which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> responds:
"I don't think I've ever felt more completely in love with you than at this
moment. Your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> and love will help me through this." Maybe the real news
here is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> is being secretly funded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democratic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Committee</ENAMEX>.

            It does have one tidbit that
fills out the portrait of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>. Her bra size is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38D</TIMEX>, and among other
interns, these assets are known as "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX>'s mountains."

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> defends its reputation as the most politically engaged of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tabloids</ENAMEX>. In addition to its coverage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flowers</ENAMEX> affair (reportedly
confirmed in a deposition by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>), it also revealed the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toe</ENAMEX>-sucking proclivities of former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Morris</ENAMEX>.

            
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> has no doubts about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX>, offering new information about how the affair started. Most reports say
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> first caught the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s eye when she wore a revealing dress to an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office party</ENAMEX>. That happened, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> , but the stage was originally
set during a chance encounter in a crowded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hallway</ENAMEX>. As she and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> passed each other, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>, who was wearing colorful harem pants,
according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>, "turned her butt toward him, pulled out the
waist-band--'and showed him I was wearing thong panties.' When she snapped the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elastic</ENAMEX> back, she giggled, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> smiled broadly--he'd gotten the message."
To any sane <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>, the message would be "Get this lunatic out of here." If the
story is true, it does show <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>'s seduction technique to be as subtle and
sophisticated as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s. At least <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> wore panties. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX>
also reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> decreed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> was not an underwear-free
zone after an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intern</ENAMEX> who favored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">microminiskirts</ENAMEX> regularly came to work with
her private parts exposed.

            In the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> 's version of events, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Peyronie's disease</ENAMEX> also rears it ugly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>.
This is the condition that causes the penis to bend at an unusual angle; for a
time it was reported that this was the "distinguishing characteristic" of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s sex organ that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paula Jones</ENAMEX> was going to reveal. According to the
publication, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pals</ENAMEX> that the presidential organ "had an abnormal
shape." But not anymore, apparently. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Star</ENAMEX> asserts he had some
corrective work done at the time of his knee surgery. And it also reports that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> had some corrective work done to her bank account at the time of her
subpoena to testify in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> case. She made a "highly unusual <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$11,000</NUMEX>
payment on her credit card," it reports. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> doesn't speculate
about the money's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.

            While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> sees <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jezebel</ENAMEX>, the
Star portrays her as a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> caught up in a heady love affair. "I
really love him," they quote her saying. "It's so exciting being with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. That's not something many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> can put on
their secret sex résumés." As far as this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> is concerned, that's
probably only as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> as can fit inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Astrodome</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> provides
details about how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> set her sights on her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, went after him despite all
obstacles, and how and where she consummated the affair with ... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Bleiler</ENAMEX>,
her high-school drama <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX>. OK, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> 's coverage disappoints,
but at least it presents a more believable account of life chez <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> . According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> has
become increasingly depressed and "has been ravenous for junk food. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Mac</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wrappers</ENAMEX>, half-full <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Slurpee</ENAMEX> drink cups and french fry bags have to be
constantly swept out of sight." He's not sleeping well and spends <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the predawn</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> alone with his best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Buddy</ENAMEX>. A furious <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> is quoted
as telling her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>: "If this is true, your life is ruined, our lives are
ruined--and so is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chelsea</ENAMEX>'s. ... You'll go down in history as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> who
couldn't keep his fly zipped up." An "insider" told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> also "stormed into her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">closet</ENAMEX>, grabbed a dress, threw it in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bill's</ENAMEX> face
and screamed, 'Is this like the dress you gave her--the one she says she's kept
as a souvenir of the affair?' "

            The
publication turns to science to assess the truthfulness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s denials of
the romance. He's lying, concludes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Harwood</ENAMEX>, who "analyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s words
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verimetrics</ENAMEX> instrument, a high-tech truth machine that measures stress
in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s voice." According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harwood</ENAMEX>, a stress factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 60</NUMEX>
indicates deception. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> denies asking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> to lie under oath
about the affair, "the stress analysis indicator skyrocketed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
was also being deceptive, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harwood</ENAMEX> says, when he denied having an "improper
relationship" with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>.

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> agree on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> was emotionally shattered at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 14</TIMEX>, when her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> divorced. This
led her to seek out older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to replace the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> she felt had abandoned her,
and to do it by mimicking the femme 
               fatale style of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>.
It's a picture of a needy young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, one whom any older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with something to
lose--or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> a brain--would have the sense to avoid.

            Although what happens seems
to be up to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> now, it may actually have already been decided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Post</ENAMEX> gossip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal Travis</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> repeated an item he
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> ran <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX>, at the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> inaugural. It was about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">astrologer Linda Ashland</ENAMEX>'s warning that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> needed to postpone his
noon swearing in because of adverse astral influences at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that hour</TIMEX>. The last
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">presidents</ENAMEX> to be sworn in under those conditions, she says, were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John F.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX>.
