            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euripides</ENAMEX> might feel at home
editing the tabloids <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>, what with murder-suicide (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Hartman</ENAMEX> and his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brynn</ENAMEX>), internecine family warfare (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinatras</ENAMEX>), incarceration for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>
beating (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Lee</ENAMEX>), and bizarre behavior (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Sheen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farrah</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fawcett</ENAMEX>).

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Comedian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Hartman</ENAMEX>'s killing hasn't made it into the supermarket tabs yet, but the
rest of the down-market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> have covered the ghastly events. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Hartman</ENAMEX>'s
murderous blond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> had a major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> habit that caused wild mood swings,"
reports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Post</ENAMEX> . The reason for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>'s fatal mood swing,
according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> ? "[She] shot him dead in a jealous rage and then
blew her brains out after he announced he was dumping her for another
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>."

            The other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> has not been universally confirmed. While
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily News</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brynn</ENAMEX> read a note from her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> implying that he wanted to end the marriage, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Daily</ENAMEX>
News quoted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comedian</ENAMEX> told him <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only a few days</TIMEX> earlier
that his marriage was "better than ever." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> also reports that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hartman</ENAMEX> recently gave his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> the ultimate ill-advised <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>
birthday present: a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Press International</ENAMEX>
reports <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hartman</ENAMEX> was murdered "execution-style," with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> shots to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to the chest, around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 a.m.</TIMEX> while he lay in bed. Shortly afterward Brynn
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nee Vicki Omdahl</ENAMEX>) fled, leaving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or both of her young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages 9</TIMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, behind. She went to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of an unidentified male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, where she
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incoherently</ENAMEX> confessed to the murder. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> did not believe her, but after
she fell asleep, he opened her purse and found a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX>. They returned to her home
early in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>, and while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> were bringing the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>
out, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brynn</ENAMEX> locked herself in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> and shot herself with another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX>.

            The
distraught <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> issued a joint statement that implied the
tragedy was some sort of creation of the press. "The unbridled speculation
offered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> are unfounded. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brynn</ENAMEX> were a loving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX>,
devoted to each other and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>." Their will gives custody of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brynn Hartman</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>.

            
After farewell tributes to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Sinatra</ENAMEX> last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> the supermarket tabs turn to the gory aftermath: the escalating
hatred between his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barbara</ENAMEX>. They have loathed each
other for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, but the final break came, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> , when
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publicist</ENAMEX> by cell phone to alert her that the dying
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX> was on his way to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cedars-Sinai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ambulance</ENAMEX>, but did not call
any of his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to tell them the news. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> was
pronounced dead, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> called his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina</ENAMEX>. So just then you're ready
to side with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> comes up with a twist. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Daughter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy</ENAMEX>,
it reports, has always been moved by the moment at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JFK</ENAMEX>'s funeral when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John-John</ENAMEX>
saluted his dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> reports <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara</ENAMEX>, "I want
to salute <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daddy</ENAMEX>." In order to do this the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> wanted a "massive,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">military-style</ENAMEX> public funeral televised worldwide."

            It turns out, according to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Enquirer</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy</ENAMEX> had already announced plans for a military
honor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> on her Web site, even though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX> had never been in the service.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara</ENAMEX> wanted a private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">funeral</ENAMEX>, with no military presence and no saluting.
When the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> came to negotiate with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Jr.</ENAMEX> just wants to
be kept out of it), according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> "the first thing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara</ENAMEX>
did was wave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX>'s will in their faces--and say tauntingly, 'Good for me--bad
for you.' " <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara</ENAMEX> got her way, and she and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> went to the
funeral in separate limos.

            They are
even feuding over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX>'s final words, reports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy</ENAMEX>
claims they were, "I'm losing." But gossip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cindy Adams</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara</ENAMEX>
told her they were "I don't want to go ... I don't want to go ... I want to be
here for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>." (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Star</ENAMEX> reports <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX> essentially died in his
sleep and had no parting words.) Now, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy</ENAMEX> is
planning a nasty tell-all book about her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stepmother</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy</ENAMEX>
has declared, "It's payback time."

            It's a sentiment <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX> at least would understand. In its
tribute issue, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> reports how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> used to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barbara</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinatra Children's Center</ENAMEX>, the place his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> established for abused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
While there he was taken with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> who, he found out, had been
sexually abused by her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>. So <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX> got the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s name and address and
drove with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jilly Rizzo</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX> put the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> in
a headlock and said if he ever abused the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> again <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX> would come back
and kill him. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara</ENAMEX> tried to ban <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, and when he showed up
anyway the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> would try to make sure he didn't see any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> there
for counseling.

            Toward the
end of his life <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX> also found himself in a charitable mood over an old
rival, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marlon Brando</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX> had seen some pictures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brando</ENAMEX> and decided he
needed to talk to the obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> about his weight. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Brando</ENAMEX> and
told him he shouldn't let himself go. "You look like f--ing hell, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brando</ENAMEX>," the
Star reports he said, and he advised the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> to lose "maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a hundred</TIMEX>
pounds, pallie." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brando</ENAMEX> replied by telling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> to "f-- off" and hung up
on him. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX> then reportedly ripped the phone out of the wall and threw it
across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. It's a scene <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Hartman</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX>, would have played so
well on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Saturday Night Live</ENAMEX> .

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M√∂tley Cr√</ENAMEX>ºe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drummer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Lee</ENAMEX> will have plenty
of time to contemplate his temper as he serves <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his six month</TIMEX> sentence for
felony <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spousal</ENAMEX> abuse of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baywatch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pamela</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson</ENAMEX>. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer Lee</ENAMEX> is in a single-person cell
because, explains an "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insider</ENAMEX>," "Nobody can beat up a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pamela</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson</ENAMEX> without someone gunning for them." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> also reports that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson</ENAMEX> plans to go ahead with her divorce and feels she can never forgive
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee</ENAMEX>. More ominously, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> is actually
planning to give him another chance and wants to try a second honeymoon after
he gets out of jail for assaulting her. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> also reports that
she is going to court to stop distribution of a home video of her having sex
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Lee</ENAMEX>, and another one of her having sex with an ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pam</ENAMEX>,
throw away the tripod!)

            Celebrity
free falls are rampant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Actor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Sheen</ENAMEX>'s latest accessory is an
electronic monitoring device, and he was ordered by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malibu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> to enter
drug treatment, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Press</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheen</ENAMEX> will then have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>
hearing on whether he violated his probation--he pleaded no contest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> ago
to attacking a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX>--by engaging in drug activity. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheen</ENAMEX> recently
overdosed on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> and methamphetamine, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>
overdose, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few months earlier</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheen</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Sheen</ENAMEX>, and other family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> tried to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX> to go to the
Promises rehab <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> (where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brynn Hartman</ENAMEX> had reportedly been treated), but he
refused. And it reports that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheen</ENAMEX> "likes free-basing and he
keeps loaded <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>." Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> predicts if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheen</ENAMEX> doesn't shape
up, "it's only a matter of time before they'll be printing his obituary."

            For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> the tabs have been reporting on what the
Star calls "a string of bizarre incidents" involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farrah</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fawcett</ENAMEX>. From an erratic performance on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">David Letterman</ENAMEX> show to a violent
confrontation with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX> to the latest, her odd behavior at the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cannes</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Film Festival</ENAMEX>. The recently face-lifted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fawcett</ENAMEX> was, according to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> , "dazed and confused" and "giggly to the point of being silly"
at the festival, where she was promoting her latest film, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Apostle</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> reports she canceled a scheduled press conference and never
showed up at a party with the movie's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Duvall</ENAMEX>. It was worse, they
say, when she did make appearances. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> quotes a "film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX>" who
says at the post-screening interview she "giggled uncontrollably ... and she
was talking gibberish." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fawcett's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> was suffering
from food poisoning.

            Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Euripides</ENAMEX> didn't write
all bummers. So on a happy note, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Carrey</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ex-wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lauren Holly</ENAMEX>, have been spotted shopping for a new set of wedding rings,
according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> . This must mean that what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX>
calls their "weird love pact" is working. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> has agreed to make love
only once a week, so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carrey</ENAMEX> can prove their relationship is not just about
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lust</ENAMEX>. And he has also agreed to stop making funny faces every time he passes a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mirror</ENAMEX>, a habit that had "frightened" his now <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ex-wife</ENAMEX>, according to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> --but that also helped boost his salary to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20 million</NUMEX> a
movie.
