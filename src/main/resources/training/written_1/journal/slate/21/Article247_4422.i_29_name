            By now, we're all familiar with the avalanche of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dot-com</ENAMEX> advertising that
buried us <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, boosting the revenues of both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Madison Avenue</ENAMEX> and the TV
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> while bringing more than a few Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to the verge of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonexistence</ENAMEX> (since they burned huge amounts of cash in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just a few months</TIMEX>). And
some of us, at least, are still looking forward to the myriad dot-com ads that
will be unveiled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at this year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Super Bowl</ENAMEX>. But while the story of these ads is
mainly one of a desperate grab for market share and brand identity via the
familiar techniques of jittery cameras, hyperbolic humor, and some measure of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with that ineffable quality we now call "extreme-ness," the most
interesting new Internet ad campaign offers none of these.

            That campaign, which debuted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of weeks ago</TIMEX> and has yet to attract
much notice, is advertising Internet discount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX> buy.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. And that is
pretty much all the campaign advertises. In contrast to the frenetic style of
most dot-com ads (which have produced some true gems, including most obviously
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Outpost</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pack</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ravenous wolves</ENAMEX> and flying gerbils, and the E*<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade</ENAMEX> and
Ameritrade campaigns), the buy.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX> TV ad features the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s name in small,
white lower-case letters on a black background. That's it. No music, no
voice-over, no sound. Just <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 seconds</TIMEX> of a name and silence. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is
also doing print and outdoor ads following the same motif, but no radio ads.
(It seems hard to believe a radio station would accept an ad that consisted of
just saying "buy.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>," followed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 seconds</TIMEX> of silence.)

            The new campaign is an attempt to cut through all of the noise--visual and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sonic</ENAMEX>--around dot-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">com</ENAMEX> advertising, and its visual distinctiveness will
undoubtedly make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> notice it. The buy.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> also suggest
that the simplicity of the ads convey an implicit message that buy.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> offers
"convenience, simplicity, and freedom from higher prices." It's certainly
pretty to think so, but the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> connection there seems a bit overdrawn,
unless we're meant to assume that products at buy.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> must be cheap since the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> isn't making enough profit to pay for real advertising. If anything,
what really conveys those values of convenience and frugality is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s
name, and in that sense the ads take advantage of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of buy.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>'s real
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">strengths</ENAMEX> ("strength" here being entirely a relative term).

            For all this, though, you have to stop short of calling the new campaign
brilliant, mainly because it's hard to see what kind of legs it will have, at
least on television. Watching the ad the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fascinating</ENAMEX>, in part because even after having seen it once, I kept expecting
something, anything , to happen at the end of the ad. (In fact, the
letters just fade out.) And there's also something compelling about the way the
ad makes you aware of how <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">long 30 seconds</TIMEX> can be. The problem is that you can
only be made aware of that so many times before you get bored. The next time I
see this ad, I'm sure I'll change the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>.

            In some sense, the buy.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> campaign reminds me of a stunt pulled by the
shoe-gazer band My <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloody Valentine</ENAMEX> during its last <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> tour. At some point
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">most</TIMEX> (perhaps all) of the shows on that tour, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> would, in the
middle of a song, begin playing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> notes and just continue playing them over
and over for close to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX>, with the sound gradually getting louder,
until, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine put it then, it sounded like you were in an airplane
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hangar</ENAMEX>. It may have been <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer than 20 minutes</TIMEX>, or it may have been shorter.
While it was happening, it seemed like an eternity. Listening to this wasn't
enjoyable in any conventional sense, or in any sense for that matter. But there
was something incredibly interesting about being in the middle of it, and about
the way your reactions to what was happening changed the longer the noise
continued. And the way the stunt exposed the conventions of the typical rock
show was adept.

            This wasn't anything you needed to listen to more than once (though I knew
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who did). Once you got the idea, re-experiencing it seemed beside the
point, and in the same way, watching the buy.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> ads again now seems beside the
point. But perhaps this is one campaign that doesn't depend on repetition, on
driving a jingle so deep into your skull that you can't forget it. Perhaps the
idea of the ad is enough to make you remember buy.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. Of course, if it works
we're going to have a flood of these campaigns, in which case you won't be able
to remember any of them. Here's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place where the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-mover advantage is
actually real.
