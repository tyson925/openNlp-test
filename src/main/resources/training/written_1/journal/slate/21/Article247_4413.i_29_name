            Well, I am more than glad that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX>
thinks that I have joined issues on the matter, and have been able to penetrate
this world notwithstanding my ivory-tower-libertarian credentials. Indeed, I
think that his answer is so useful precisely because it does not rely on any
private norms of the cyberspace <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> in dealing with the broader issues.
Substantively, the question he poses at the outset of his letter is one that we
should all answer: Why is this space different from any other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>? Why and
how will markets reduce freedom there?

            In answering that question, I will start again from the other side, to make
the case that the complications and issues that he sees in cyberspace are
reflections of similar issues that have developed in other markets, where the
issue is the same: How do we overlay private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sort</ENAMEX> or another
on some common grid or infrastructure? It is clear that architecture matters in
both kinds of space and in pretty much the same kind of way. As a first
approximation, we need to have public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highways</ENAMEX> because it is simply too costly
in ordinary space to build <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> that stand one beside the other each limited
to a certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">converse</ENAMEX> hardly follows from that observation:
There is no need for all <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> to be public. A large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch</ENAMEX> can have lots of
private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highways</ENAMEX> for internal communication. Common gated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> have
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> that exclude the public by allowing limited entry by all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commons</ENAMEX>. And if someone could acquire the land to build a private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> beside a
public one, we should not begrudge him because he removes some traffic from the
common infrastructure.

            Now what happens if the cost of private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> really drops, so that everyone
can afford the right level of individualization? The answer is that we get more
private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>. This is what has happened in the telephone industry: The party
line (by which several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> shared a single telephone line) went the way of
the dodo when the cost of technology allowed for cheaper phone lines to be
developed. And so it is on the Net. The reduction in cost could easily allow
the creation of private lines side by side with that open space; and if we have
these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regimes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and private, operating side by side, we can recognize
it not only as a profound change in the Net, but a welcome change that is
predictable as a matter of general economic theory.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX> is less sanguine about this because he thinks that the architecture of
these private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> does more than make commerce more efficient. It also
makes control cheaper. But here I can accept the descriptive conclusion but
doubt whether he has pointed to a matter of concern. It is as not as though
when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> starts its broadband system that it can compel me to join it.
There still remains the older public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> for those who do not want to go along
the private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. The presence of AT&T allows for more sorting in the
marketplace, which means that those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who care more about freedom can move
in one direction, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hackers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>; while those who
care more about security can migrate to a network that gives them protection
against anything from advertisement to smut. It is hard to see any systemwide
threat to liberty when new technology increases the ability of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
to separate themselves from their fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and to filter out the information
that they do not want. It is not as though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> is replacing the open Net.
It is giving an alternative avenue to it.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX> then talks about the issue of anonymity, and there again we have to
look at both sides of the question. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> prize anonymous speech: The
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Federalist Papers</ENAMEX> were written in that voice. But no one prizes anonymous
threats or thefts; so the question is whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> will trade in liberty
for security in the same fashion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke</ENAMEX> asked in dealing with the social
contract. Nor is there anything that says that the choice of anonymity or
identification has to be made once and for all. Credit-card companies
frequently collate data in ways that allow for targeted mailings by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> welcome this because they know that the address can be
used by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertiser</ENAMEX> without being given to him: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> prepares a list
for third-party use and guarantees that the names fit certain protocols. Anyone
who wants out can click a button to escape. Here, a good technology allows
choices to be heavily individuated. A technological and design issue that
expands freedom in sensible ways. It is not that the Net is "architected" as
though it were an all or nothing issue. It is the extent that any portal to the
Net <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> itself and gives notice of its deep structure to the rest of the
world.

            On a similar front, several high-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Laboratory Schools</ENAMEX> designed a program that allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to cover
their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tracks</ENAMEX> when they surf the Net. Here again the private response to the
systemwide structure helps improve matters. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cookies</ENAMEX> are subject to the same
analysis. Let Netscape track me so long as they disclose what they are doing.
But I think that they would lose market share if they did not allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to
disable the system with a click of the mouse, which I take it they do. So again
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individuation</ENAMEX> works. Taken as a whole, then, I see no reason for gloom that we
have changed the Net as its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user population</ENAMEX> changes.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX> promises us that more is in store: The older Net was "end-to-end," so
that all the action was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> applications. That is fine in principle.
But what if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> wants to put his own private network at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>? I see
nothing wrong with this approach, and it would allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> to have, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">notes</ENAMEX>, a heavily regulated internal computer culture, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> is more open--a good reason for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX> to return to his intellectual
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>. But does the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> add-on violate the old principle? Not
as far as I can see. It is the gated community example all over. The same open
Net carries the same traffic as before. It is not as though the size of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commons</ENAMEX> is diminished because of the subdivision on its side.

            But what about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>? Let it build its own system so long as it does not
shut down any other. But now they want to make sure that they influence the
traffic over the Net. So they will get less for the service they supply and
others will remain part time on the public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX>. Or, if they have acquired
too many direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX>, then we have a situation where there are possible
earthbound antitrust issues, a point on which I would be skeptical given the
ease of entry through other portals on the Net. Its power to discriminate could
add value to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>; and if it does not, it will become the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gandor Airport</ENAMEX>
of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 st century</TIMEX>.

            Maybe now we have an explanation for the larger puzzle. Why are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cyber</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">libertarians</ENAMEX> slow to recognize the dangers to the Net from the new set of
uses? My explanation is that of optimism itself. I don't think there are
dangers that are anything close to the enormous possibilities that are
introduced by the enormous expansion of its use. That one Net can support
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of Web sites dedicated to all sorts of different ends is a tribute to
the original model of how private diversity can flourish on a public grid. What
is truly optimistic about the Net is the sense of ratios. The amount of space
that has to be kept public for all to gain access is relatively small compared
with the amount of land that has to be used to maintain a coherent highway
system. So I quite agree that we should pay attention to these changes. But I
disagree that we should view them with suspicion. The blurb on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX>'s book
speaks of it as a "dark, exhilarating work." I see the cause of exhilaration
but don't have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX>'s dark forebodings. So long as we keep our intellectual
feet firmly on the ground, we shall not lose our way in cyberspace. Over to you
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX>, to explain why this happy estimation of the future is misguided, and a
gloomier response is warranted.
