               Memo to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Shrum</ENAMEX>: Your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>, needs to "strangle the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> in the bath"--that is, crush
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> caucuses <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next Monday</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> primary <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight days later</TIMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> gets
into the open field of the post-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> contests, he'll surely deplete
your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">campaign treasury</ENAMEX>, and he might just win. Unfortunately, the latest polls
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> are all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lot</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> polls show you ahead; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Massachusetts</ENAMEX> poll
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shows Bradley</ENAMEX> beating you by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> points. Other polls show a virtual tie. As you
know, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> can shift en masse in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the final few days</TIMEX> before the
primary--ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Mondale</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX>, they may be inclined to vote for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> to "keep the contest going" and prevent you from wrapping it up.

            It looks pretty iffy. Which is why sincerely I hope
you're busy finishing up the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-second</TIMEX> ads that can destroy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hampshire</ENAMEX>, the ones highlighting his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> vote against welfare reform. Remember
the poll <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last fall</TIMEX> that showed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> --let alone the all-important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">independents</ENAMEX>--thought less
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> when told of his welfare vote? (That was twice as many as thought
better of him.) ... The welfare spots don't have to be harsh or anti-left. They
can be uplifting. Ex-welfare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> going to work, earning income, gaining
respect ... and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> voted against it! ... Bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>! ... Keep the ads in
the can and drop them on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 25, the day</TIMEX> after all those
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal activists</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> caucuses have had their say. ...

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Toobin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hypocrite</ENAMEX>, Part
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>: In his book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vast Conspiracy</ENAMEX> , you'll
recall,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Yorker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Toobin</ENAMEX> denounces "sexual
investigative reporting" as "tawdry voyeurism" and "sleaze." But that doesn't
prevent him from recounting, on Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>, the allegation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Kirkland</ENAMEX>
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paula Jones</ENAMEX> "gave him a 'blow job'" and that he'd seen her "giving blow
jobs to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, whom he named." Is that really relevant? Well,
maybe it is. What's inexcusable is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toobin</ENAMEX> waits <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> pages to mention that
a) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kirkland</ENAMEX> is a convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forger</ENAMEX>; who b) had had "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>, eight
even" beers <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> in question; and c) hadn't actually seen Jones give the
serial blow jobs to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>. Simple fairness should have suggested that
Toobin at least hint strongly during his initial presentation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kirkland</ENAMEX>'s
tale that it was uncorroborated and would later prove a problem for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toobin</ENAMEX> could easily have done that while preserving narrative
suspense. ... He might also have mentioned that none of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kirkland</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>
backed up the allegations. ... But then, actually checking out and evaluating a
story like that is "sexual investigative reporting," isn't it? ...

            
               Plotting the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Perfect</ENAMEX>
Kausfiles Vacation! 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kausfiles</ENAMEX> is always willing to follow the innovative lead of its
fellow start-up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>, Talk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>. This
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX>'s Talk features a charming <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-page travel
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> entitled "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chasing Mr. Ripley</ENAMEX>," a tour of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> keyed to the locations
used in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Talented Mr. Ripley</ENAMEX> , the movie
everyone's talking about. ... OK, nobody's talking about it, but it does just
happen to be produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey Weinstein</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miramax Films</ENAMEX>, which co-owns
Talk , and which certainly hoped that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would be talking about it. In this synergistic
spirit, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kausfiles</ENAMEX> dispatched <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raoul Danto</ENAMEX>, one of
its top doppelg√§ngers, on a no-expense-spared quest to map out the ultimate,
self-promotional kausfiles holiday. He filed this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>:

            
               Planning the perfect
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">kausfiles</ENAMEX> vacation can be tough to do, because
basically this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> just sits around his living room staring at his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX>
laptop. Sometimes in his bathrobe! This can be a little disorienting for the
dedicated kausfiles vacationer. Just getting out of
bed and eating breakfast is a day's travel for the new Web publication's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>! "Think of it as a mosaic, a jigsaw puzzle," he said when I rang him for
help. "The map of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kausfiles</ENAMEX> bears little relation
to a real map. It's a map of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kausfiles</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>."
            

            The trick, of course, is not to get too literal-minded.
(It's not that big an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>. And he's out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>.) But a rough kausfiles
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tour</ENAMEX> might start at the picturesque ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JJ Fresh</ENAMEX>
Produce, across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> from the kausfiles pensione in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battery Park City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. (Think Alphaville
meets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last Year</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marienbad</ENAMEX> .) Say hi to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX>, the counter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. Then it's off to catch the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metroliner</ENAMEX> to sun-dappled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> Visit the romantic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brookings</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institution</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Burtless</ENAMEX> greets you at the door!--and browse the
bookstore for the latest on <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 8</ENAMEX> housing vouchers. Try not to buy too
much! ... <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Next</ENAMEX>, grab a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cab</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> to the forbidding
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 th -century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, funded with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MacArthur</ENAMEX>
genius grants, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Center</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Policy Priorities</ENAMEX>, where
you'll swap food-stamp statistics with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Greenstein</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendell Primus</ENAMEX>!
... A quick subway ride and you're at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.F. Folks</ENAMEX> luncheonette, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>, will tell you his plan to save <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and what he really
thinks of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Republic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor-in-chief</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marty</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peretz</ENAMEX>. But don't dawdle, because you have to catch the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
in time to file. ... It's granola <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> in the dinette <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for dinner (stay away
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amtrak</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza</ENAMEX>!) as you unpack your complimentary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage Foundation</ENAMEX>
tote bag to discover your own personalized copy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">1998 Green Book</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Background Material and Data on Programs</ENAMEX> Within the Jurisdiction of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee on Ways and Means</ENAMEX>! ... Before you know it,
you're at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penn Station</ENAMEX>, out of cash. Take the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> subway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. Get off at the
wrong stop. You're in trendy Tribeca! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Damon</ENAMEX> lives around here somewhere
