            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Peggy</ENAMEX>,

            I confess with embarrassment that I didn't do my homework: that is, I didn't
go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Core</ENAMEX>'s Web site to see just how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>'s lists are treated by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">originator</ENAMEX> himself, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.D. Hirsch</ENAMEX>. I took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> at his word that his vast lists
did not mean that first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graders</ENAMEX> were to make it all the way from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mesopotamia</ENAMEX> to
ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX>, but that they would "study topics
such as" those. By that I assumed he meant they would pick from among them.
(And even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hirsch</ENAMEX> can be a little obscure on his Web site, emphasizing that the
lesson plans are not meant as "recipes"--though they certainly are presented
that way.) I suppose I was misled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>'s own avowal that he did not have
in mind "a grand game of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Trivial Pursuit</ENAMEX>." And I was encouraged by the few
occasions on which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> elaborate and suggest projects such as analyzing
a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX> newspaper report about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yalta</ENAMEX> conference, reading immigrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diaries</ENAMEX>,
staging a re-enactment of the surrender at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appomattox</ENAMEX>, having a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> come in
to talk about life in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Depression</ENAMEX>.

            All that sounded like plenty of pausing to do in-depth, interesting work. It
sounded better than the fancy new textbook one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> used <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> to
study <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</TIMEX>, which aspired to spend equal time on the non-Western
world--and so ended up spending much too little time on anything. Similarly, it
has struck me that my other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> might benefit from more writing of paragraphs
and less discussion of "rubrics" and "hamburger model graphic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizers</ENAMEX>" in
her writing periods. And some of the new new math, in its hands-on emphasis,
does often seem to add up to busywork--lots of cutting and pasting, to take
last night's assignment, even though the concept of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">square feet</NUMEX> and yards had
sunk in after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first few snips</TIMEX>. I fear my reading of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>'s lists was
clouded by a wishful vision of more purposefully directed, but still active and
innovative, learning. Then again, that's what makes books like these
bestsellers: In a format as broad as this, it's possible to find some version
of what you want to find.

            But you're right, my confusion and your criticism of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hirsch</ENAMEX>'s hectic pace
point to the need for a serious discussion about a standardized curriculum, and
what it might look like, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, would prefer to avoid, being
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champions</ENAMEX> of localism in education. Hence their enthusiasm for reform by
grass-roots parental agitation, the problems of which you spelled out very
well. And there's another one: Even if constant parental lobbying at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and
hounding at home could possibly be as conflict-free and effective as they
suggest, what would the results look like? It seems to me this is a recipe for
widening the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>. Guess which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are going to be poking their noses into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX> all the time, to
say nothing of turning "those garden chores into botany lessons." The ones
whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> hardly need a superdose of after-school enrichment.

            As for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> education, I'm all for it, but not for preaching endlessly
about it and calling it "training," as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, do in proudly
old-fashioned style. I don't like values clarification any better in the
trendy, therapeutic incarnation that also seems to be popular: schoolwide
discussions of teasing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</TIMEX>, being compassionate the next, combatting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> stereotypes the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> after that. As a contrived package of traditional
wholesomeness, the more authoritarian values of respect, order, obedience, and
cleanliness can prove stultifying, distracting. (Legible handwriting has
practical, not moral, virtue.) So can the progressive virtues of critical
thinking, independence, creativity, and community solidarity when served up as
the only enlightened approach, or as self-esteem-building therapy.

            Religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> have an easier job in this realm. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>'s favorite
ecumenical form of character instruction, of course, is moral stories. As
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> points out, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Kohl</ENAMEX> favors the same, on the other side of the
spectrum. The problem both encounter in trying to script the lessons in too
didactic a way--rule out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Babar</ENAMEX> as colonialist, racist, sexist (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kohl</ENAMEX>),
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rehabilitate Goody Two Shoes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>)--is that they often end up with duller
stories than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> deserve, tidily presented with trite interpretations. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homiletic</ENAMEX> approach, in my experience, seems to work best in connection with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sports</ENAMEX>, where all the uplifting talk--"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> is what you have, effort is what
you give," play by the rules, practice makes perfect, etc.--goes along with
real action (and, often, very obvious consequences). For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, rising
to academic challenges posed by admired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, it seems to me, offers the
best route to building the responsible, committed attitude everybody hopes for
in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>--better, surely, than any special workshop is likely to. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> think
that making right choices is a consequence of having a strong, well-integrated
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">personality</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruno Bettelheim</ENAMEX> once wrote. "Actually, it's the other way
around: it is making choices--right ones--that builds a strong personality."
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Schools</ENAMEX> should be one important place that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have the chance to make
those choices.

            Speaking of choices, without launching into a debate on school choice, I
wonder whether you see a growing gap between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and elite private
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>--I don't mean in quality, however one might define that, but in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">pedagogical</ENAMEX> culture that prevails. It's a question raised by my own
observations of pretty stark contrasts (plenty of homework in the early primary
grades in public school vs. next to none in private) and by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>'s book. Is
it increasingly a choice between back-to-basics traditionalism in the
test-conscious public school system and a considerably more progressive, or
"constructivist," ethos in private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>? Or am I making this up?
