            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the well-deserved perils of writing a column like this is that
occasionally someone will come along and, because of something you've written,
call you--pardon my <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX>--a "dumbfuck." As it happens, I'm not plucking that
word at random from the ether, because in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dumb Money</ENAMEX> , a forthcoming
book about his adventures as a day <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joey Anuff</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suck</ENAMEX> ) calls me precisely
that. (The book, by the way, is terrific, and you should buy it when it comes
out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this spring</TIMEX>.)

            The source of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anuff</ENAMEX>'s ire was an item I did in one of my "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekend Cocktail</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chats</ENAMEX>" in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall of 1998</TIMEX>, just after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> went public. The item mocked the
online auction site as yet another fly-by-night Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> with no hope
of profitability and a market capitalization that bore no connection to
reality. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anuff</ENAMEX> eventually became a day <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> seems to have been
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that he truly loved and invested in out of a real faith in its
business, and so my ill-advised and ill-informed scorn made him a bit more
annoyed than an item mocking, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Steel</ENAMEX> might have.

            I bring this all up because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> reported earnings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, and the report
illuminated what now seems to me to be essentially indisputable, which is that
the economics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> are tremendous and its future is very bright.
(This, of course, makes me wonder why I wasn't able to see then what I see now,
and what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anuff</ENAMEX> saw then.) Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> is essentially just facilitating
interactions between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> and not building or even really selling
anything itself, its gross margins (that is, the cost of actually providing its
"goods") are almost guaranteed to remain high. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> obviously
needs to invest heavily in technology to be able to handle its ever-increasing
volume of items for sale, there are no obvious limitations on how big its
virtual marketplace can grow, making it, in that sense, almost infinitely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scalable</ENAMEX>. And the bigger it gets, and the more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> grow comfortable with it,
the wider the variety of goods <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will buy and sell on it.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX>'s real strength, though, is that it is the quintessential example of
the so-called network effect, which says that the value of any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> to its
users increases sharply--perhaps even geometrically--as the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of
that network increases. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> effect is often bandied about as
characteristic of many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> on the Net, but in fact there is no "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>"
on the Net like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX>'s. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sellers</ENAMEX> want to go where there are the most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> want to go where there are the most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX>, and therefore the positive
feedback loop here seems practically unbreakable. For that very reason, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> is
also one of the rare examples in which the much-vaunted "<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-mover" advantage
also seems to have been real, although if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> had not executed as well as it
has, being first would not have been enough.

            There are a couple of quirks to this story. For all the power of the network
effect, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> has seen its domination of online auctions eroded by the entry of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yahoo</ENAMEX> into the market. I'm still not sure why (whenever I buy
something on auction at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX>, I can never figure out why the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> isn't
selling the item on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX>, where I feel certain I would have been outbid). But
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yahoo</ENAMEX> do have powerful customer bases of their own, and have set up
their interfaces so that auction items find their way to regular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>
fairly easily. Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> lets you buy a lot of items with a credit card, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> has also faced price competition. Still, it now controls <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 percent</NUMEX> of the
market, and that's actually up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX>.

            The other quirk is that over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX>'s stock price has not
really moved much (although it did jump <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 percent</NUMEX> in the wake of this latest
earnings report). The stock is down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 percent</NUMEX> from its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52-week</TIMEX> high, and it's
up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2 percent</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last March</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way of reading this is to say that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> finally woke up to the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> is still making just <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four cents</NUMEX>
a share, not much different than it was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. But another way of reading
this is that there were enough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anuff</ENAMEX> at the beginning who
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">understood eBay</ENAMEX>'s business and understood why they should own its stock that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> became fully valued not long after it went public. In other words,
it may be that in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX>'s case, the stock market was fairly efficient, arriving
at the "right" price in a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> rather than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> (as arguably was
the case with stocks like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>). That doesn't mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX>'s
stock won't go up (or down) from here, especially since volatility is now a way
of life for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> stocks. But it probably means that expecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> to become
a proverbial <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-bagger (rise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1,000 percent</NUMEX>) from here is a mistake.

            The interesting thing about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> for me is the way it crystallizes my
changing view of Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, and Internet stocks, over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. What once appeared to be a bubble driven by hysterical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> now
looks much more to me like as good an attempt as possible at quantifying the
value of an economic opportunity that, taken as a whole, still looks
practically limitless. (Of course, to almost everyone else, it looks like a
bubble.) And while discussion of the Net remains swamped with hype and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">buzzwords</ENAMEX>, there clearly are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yahoo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX>, that
demonstrate that you can take advantage of that opportunity and still make a
profit. I'd say I knew it all along. But my bank account won't let me.
