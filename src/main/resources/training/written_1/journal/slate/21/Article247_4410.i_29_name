            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economic Policy Institute</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Center</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Policy Priorities</ENAMEX>
issued a joint study <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Pulling Apart</ENAMEX>" that shows, on a state-by-state and national
basis, that income inequality in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has continued to worsen in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX>, building on a trend that began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1970s</TIMEX>. Although the
report focuses attention on the huge gap between the top <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> of
income-earning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and the bottom <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX>, a gap worthy of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>, the more
striking numbers delineate the widening gap between the top <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> of income
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">earners</ENAMEX> (and, within that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, the top <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX> in particular) and everyone
else.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between the late 1970s and the late 1990s</TIMEX>, for example, the top <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> saw
its average real income rise by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 35 percent</NUMEX>, while the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth fifth</NUMEX>
(closest to the top) saw real income rise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 percent</NUMEX>, and the middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fifth</ENAMEX> saw
real income rise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 7 percent</NUMEX>. As a result, the top <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> now averages about
twice as much as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second fifth</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times as much as the middle
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX>.

            Now, you might say to this, so what? In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are
not static. Not everyone in the top <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last year</TIMEX> of the study)
was there in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, nor will everyone there in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> be there in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2008</TIMEX>. (Though a
much higher percentage will be than won't.) In addition, inequality itself is a
tricky problem. If remedying inequality comes at the expense of overall growth,
then it's possible that the poor and middle class will end up worse in absolute
terms even if their relative position improves.

            In general, after all, the best remedy for poverty, and the best way to lift
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> into the middle class, is not income redistribution but rather economic
growth. Although many critiques of globalization and free trade depend, at
least implicitly, on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marx</ENAMEX>'s immiseration thesis, which held that growth in a
capitalist economy inevitably impoverished most while enriching a few, the
experience of most capitalist economies, and especially those in the Third
World, has demonstrated exactly the opposite. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> study of more
than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> fast-growing economies showed that in nearly all of them, growth did
not meaningfully change income distribution, and that even the poorest <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> of
income-earners reaped absolute benefits from economic growth. (The study did
show that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> that adopted land reform growth was more equitable.)

            Unfortunately, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> does not fit well into that study. On the
contrary, the remarkable thing is how narrow the benefits, even in absolute
terms, of the boom of the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</TIMEX> have been. Remember, the middle <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX>
of income-earning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> saw its real income rise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 7 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX>,
and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 2 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decade</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second fifth</NUMEX> saw its real income
actually drop since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1980s</TIMEX>, while the poorest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fifth</ENAMEX> saw its
income stay relatively steady.

            These statistics are, of course, subject to question. If the Consumer Price
Index really overstates inflation, then those real income numbers should be
higher. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">After-tax</ENAMEX> numbers, because the federal income tax is progressive, would
not be as striking. And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past couple of years</TIMEX> have seen real--although still
small--wage increases for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, increases they did not enjoy for most
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>.

            Still, the economic inequality we now have in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> is of a
magnitude we have not witnessed since before the New Deal. And what's
remarkable is that it's happening at a time when unemployment is at historic
lows and when economic growth is much faster than most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> thought
possible. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Moore</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cato Institute</ENAMEX>, pooh-poohing the new study, said
that the best solution to the problems it raises--assuming they are
problems--would be to cut the capital-gains tax, spurring greater investment.
But it seems implausible that putting more money in the stock market or in
venture capital funds will affect income inequality at all. More to the point,
if the economy grows any faster than it is now, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX>
will just slam on the brakes. In terms of growth and employment, this is
probably as good as it gets. And as good as it gets is actually making income
gaps wider, rather than narrowing them.

            Whether economic inequality of the magnitude the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> now has
should matter to a society is, of course, a matter of principle, and not logic.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Krugman</ENAMEX> made a good case for its
importance.) And we should not let concern over inequality obscure the
lessons of the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX>: the virtues of deregulation, competition,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entrepreneurship</ENAMEX>, and, above all, the allocation of capital by markets, not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX>. But as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> heads into its latest round of budget planning, and
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dubya</ENAMEX> tries to offer up his latest "middle-class" tax cut, it's probably
worth remembering who's actually in the middle class, and whether those who are
a long way out of it really need yet another break.
