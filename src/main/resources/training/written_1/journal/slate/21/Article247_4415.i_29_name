            There's this really awful experience that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> know--not great
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, but ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, or at least <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> who have not taught well.
It is the experience of reading an exam from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> who just didn't get it.
There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of tricks to pass the blame--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> didn't study; the
student just isn't bright; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> must have had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a bad day</TIMEX>, etc. But in the
end, such a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> can't escape the feeling that the fault is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>.
Had the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>--had I--done a better job in explaining it, then this student
would have gotten it.

            And so it is with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>'s latest reply. I don't have the excuse of a slow
student--trust me on that. And obviously before reviewing a book, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX>
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX> would have read it. So to see his latest filled with mistakes
can only say something about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>.

            The picture that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">animates</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> reply is "side by side" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>.
This mirrors his picture of before, of many different <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> at the ends of the
wires, so to speak, some commercial, some not. With both pictures, the moral is
the same--neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> on the side, nor the commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> at the
ends, will effect the value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commons</ENAMEX>. The original Internet is that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commons</ENAMEX>; the rise of commerce won't diminish it.

            But the story I told in my book--I thought ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">infinitum</ENAMEX>, but apparently not
enough--was of changes that would affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commons</ENAMEX>. Changes that would change
the experience of the Net that we know right now. Changes that would make it
less protective of free speech, changes that would make it more invasive of
privacy, changes that would make it more susceptible to regulation, changes
that would interfere with the free flow of ideas.

            So take the example of regulation. It was commonplace at the start of the
Internet revolution for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to celebrate the fact that life there could not
be regulated. But in my book, I told the story about an increasingly
"certificate-rich" Internet--meaning an Internet where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> more and more
frequently carried ("voluntarily") digital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDs</ENAMEX>. In one version of that story,
these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDs</ENAMEX> collect all sorts of facts about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. And in that version, these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDs</ENAMEX> are designed to be checked automatically by servers as you pass along the
information <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX>. And thus, in that version, quite invisibly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> is
now able to identify all sorts of facts about you--whether you are an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>,
whether you are over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>, where you live, etc. And then, as a byproduct of this
change, it becomes possible once again for local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to begin to impose
regulation on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on the Net, by forcing local servers to condition access
based on the features of who <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are. It becomes possible, that is, to zone
the net, and to re-empower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> control over behavior on the Net.

            Now, the argument is a bit complex. And no doubt one could disagree with it.
But it is hard for me to see how one could read that argument, and then talk
about "gated communities" or "side by side" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. The argument is about the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commons</ENAMEX>, not the ends; it is about the control that is enabled for those in the
Internet we know now; and it is about the control that gets enabled because of
the emergence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> kind of architecture of identity. It is about a control
over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commons</ENAMEX>, not a control in gated communities.

            Or consider another argument at the core of the book, this one about free
speech. When the concern about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and "porn" became pressing, many said a
perfect solution would be code that helped filter content on the Net. And a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of very talented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> came up with an architecture to facilitate
this filtering. They called it the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Platform for Internet Content Selection</ENAMEX>, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PICS</ENAMEX>. Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PICS</ENAMEX>, individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> could rate their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>, but more
important, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> could rate the material of others. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PICS</ENAMEX> was valuable
because it was "neutral." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian Right</ENAMEX> could have its ratings; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACLU</ENAMEX>
its ratings as well. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> would then select the rating system they want,
and then their PICS-enabled browser (as both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape</ENAMEX> and Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer</ENAMEX> are
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just now</TIMEX>) would filter content according to this rating.

            Sounds just great. Until one notices another feature of this
architecture--not only is it neutral horizontally (anyone can rate the Net),
but it is also neutral vertically (the filters can be imposed at any place in
the distribution chain--at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISP</ENAMEX>, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX>, or
conceivably, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>). And more significant, this vertical filter would not
announce itself as a filter. It could block access invisibly. So that this
technology inspired to help <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> deal with the problems of "porn" would
now become a technology that would lower the cost of censorship generally. And
so the feature of the original Internet that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> celebrated most
firmly--that it embedded, architecturally, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX>--would, under this
plan, flip. The technology would enable just the sort of speech control the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Amendment</ENAMEX> bans.

            Now again, this is not a straightforward argument. One can disagree with it,
as many have. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Godwin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Resnick</ENAMEX> have written strong and persuasive
articles against my position. And I have seen how earlier parts of my argument
were wrong.

            But I don't understand how one would believe that this change that I am
describing is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about gated</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, or a side-by-side <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. I don't
understand how one would read this argument and not get that it is about the
effect these changes will have on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commons</ENAMEX>.

            Or finally, take privacy again. Once again, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX> has a rosy story.
There's nothing to worry about in this best-of-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-possible-worlds:

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Let Netscape</ENAMEX> track me so long as they disclose what they are doing. But I
think they would lose market share if they did not allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to disable the
system with a click of the mouse, which I take it, they do."

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> let's clear up a confusion. The question isn't <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape</ENAMEX>'s tracking, it
is the tracking of servers that we're describing. And <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, in fact, there is
no obligation to disclose anything. Sites have their "privacy policies" (has
anyone ever read one of them?), but the interesting question is about sites
sharing data. You give your name to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> site, but choose not to give your name
to another, yet unbeknownst to you, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are allied, and using a common
cookie identification, they can share what you didn't want shared.

            "Let them disclose," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX> says. But why would they, absent an obligation
to do so? Because again, by hypothesis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> don't know the data is being
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX>. So they don't know enough to punish the sharer, by reducing its market
share.

            But of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX> says, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape</ENAMEX> will allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to turn <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX> off.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>, have you ever tried to turn <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX> off and then surf the Net?
Sure, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> have given you that "option," but the option
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> are given is not, as you predict, a technology that "allows choices
to be heavily individuated." The option is a crude one--all off, or all on, or
clumsily choose at each site.

            There are more efficient technologies, that wouldn't bother you at each turn
with the cookie question--you'll recall I describe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> in my book. But
as I ask there, why would one expect the market voluntarily to adopt these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX>? For to build in a technology that allows choices to be heavily
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individuated</ENAMEX> is to build in a technology that increases the costs of getting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. But in Internet space, data is gold. Under the existing architecture,
commercial sites get it for free. What is the mechanism that one would imagine
whereby these sites adopt technologies to give up what they now get for
free?

            Once again, mine is a hard argument to make. Reasonable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have
disagreed with the particulars I recommend. But I don't see how one can see
this as a problem about gated communities. Once again, it is a change that
affects life in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commons</ENAMEX>.

            In all these cases, the changes I am describing are changes to the core
experience of life on the Net. And the question we should ask is how these
changes will affect what we find valuable in the Net. The point is not against
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">libertarians</ENAMEX>. Indeed, one could imagine a libertarian critique of emerging
architectures on the Net just as one could imagine a libertarian critique of
new laws for the Net. I'm not arguing about the values you should have; I'm
trying to point to a newly salient threat to whatever values you might
have--the regulations of code.

            Trying, but not succeeding, not even with one of my brightest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>. So
we part ways here. You and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pangloss</ENAMEX>, me and the reality that what I thought
was a fairly obvious point, I have obviously failed to convey.
