            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Christine</ENAMEX>--

            All right, all right ... so maybe I exaggerated a little when I said you
were a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> operative plotting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>'s demise when you ran into him
outside that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> movie theater way back when. So I took a little
literary license. Trust me, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>. The story works great when you're not
around to correct it with trifles like the facts.

            I do remember the laughable panic that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> plunges into every time
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> gets so much as a dusting of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX>. But here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>, as you
know, the mindset is a little different. Here it takes the equivalent of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">percussion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> to get anyone's attention. Here, we don't chitchat much about
the weather or foreign policy or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">world</ENAMEX> peace. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every day</TIMEX> is a Seinfeld
episode and, even when it's not, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tabloid</ENAMEX> headline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> try to turn it
into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. We're the hard-to-please connoisseurs of a unique local art form: The
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Truly Weird Story</ENAMEX>.

            Take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. Rather than waking up and remarking about the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four inches</NUMEX> of
snow we received here <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>, the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">story</ENAMEX> here is about the two office
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> who were stuck in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">skyscraper</ENAMEX> elevator that went on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>-story free
fall--only to screech to a stop near the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> when the emergency brake
kicked in.

            Apparently, some rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> took an adjacent elevator to the place where
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> were stuck, took out the side panels that separated the two
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">elevator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, then asked them to make a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tightrope</ENAMEX> walk across a narrow beam
that spanned the shaft between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">elevators</ENAMEX>, as if these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> poor
knee-knocking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souls</ENAMEX> were suddenly the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> coming of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Wallenda</ENAMEX>.

            They did it. But can you say 'intensive therapy'?

            Another headline here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mia Farrow</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seamus</ENAMEX>, wants to enroll
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>. Even though he's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>. Apparently, he's already taking
courses at a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>. I read that and thought I can't
even remember what I was doing at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>? Can you? I faintly recall jamming a full
pack of bubblegum into my mouth before every softball game I played. And
falling asleep to <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> games that I listened to on a transistor radio I
smuggled to bed. And getting so dusty from playing outside <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> that I could
wet my finger and write my name on my dirt-covered legs. Back then, my parents
had just bought us a homicidal pony named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankee</ENAMEX>, and while I was trying to
ride him <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>, he bucked me right over a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-rail <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fence</ENAMEX>. I landed in some
tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> with a thud.

            Perhaps not surprisingly, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years later</TIMEX> I had to go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> because of a
back problem. I had a slightly cracked disk, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> asked me how it
might've happened. And I thought about being launched off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> and all the
other stuff that happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that same year</TIMEX>--the time I fell out of a tree in my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">neighbor</ENAMEX>'s yard, the time I fell <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 feet</NUMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hay loft</ENAMEX> and landed unhurt on a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">barn</ENAMEX> floor covered with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">straw</ENAMEX>; the time I wrecked a minibike or fell into a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ravine</ENAMEX> after trying to swing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-handed on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree vine</ENAMEX>, like I'd just seen
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny Weismuller</ENAMEX> do in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tarzan</ENAMEX> movie. I also fell smack on my head in gym
class when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmate</ENAMEX> forgot to hold my legs onto the uneven bars as I
practicing a gymnastics maneuver called a "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flying Eagle</ENAMEX>." I couldn't turn my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX>.

            So just as I'm about to tell my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leopold</ENAMEX>, all this, she's staring at
the X-ray and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">absently</ENAMEX> says, "You know, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> of these back problems are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hereditary</ENAMEX>."

            So that's what I was doing at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 12</TIMEX>. I didn't even know the word
"matriculation."

            Gotta run now because the TV news has just started a story about the police
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apprehending</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soccer Guy</ENAMEX>"--this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX> bandit who distracted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> by
breaking into a soccer-ball-handling routine, then circling and bumping them
until he'd pickpocketed their wallets. As local lore goes, it doesn't match the
all-time classic ("<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Headless Body Found in Topless Bar"</ENAMEX>). Nor does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soccer Guy</ENAMEX>
seem like an appellation that's likely to go down in the annals of crime
alongside <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sammy</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bull</ENAMEX>--or even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paulie Walnuts</ENAMEX>, that hit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sopranos</ENAMEX>.

            But, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">snowy days</TIMEX> like this, you take what you can
get.

            Stay warm,
Johnette
