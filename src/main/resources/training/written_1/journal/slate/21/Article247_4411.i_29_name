            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times lead with the failure <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> of a key test of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>'s
prototype anti-missile defense system. The "kill vehicle" was anything but,
missing the surrogate incoming warhead <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">140 miles</NUMEX> above the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX>
leads with its latest political poll, which finds that no issue is considered
extremely important by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 40 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>, suggesting that
in the presidential election, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>' perceived personal qualities may
be more important than their positions on the issues. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> goes completely local above the fold, with
its top non-local story the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX>' fiercely contested advance into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grozny</ENAMEX>.
(The early editions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today's Papers</ENAMEX> works
from closed before the missile test results had been released.)

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> explains that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>'s failed test was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time the system's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anti-missile</ENAMEX> was evaluated while being governed by a fully integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> of
sensors. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> say there will be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> more test before
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> decides up or down on the program. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> high up
says that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s failure "measurably increases the odds" that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> will
choose not to go ahead with a national missile shield.

            On the heels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s studies from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">think tanks</ENAMEX> suggesting that the
income gap between rich and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> continues to grow, the LAT fronts and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> front-indexes similar word today
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX>. The difference is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> focused not on income
but on accumulated wealth. Some of the more striking findings: Although from
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995 to 1998</TIMEX> the median family net worth rose from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$60,900 to $71,600</NUMEX>, the
median family with a main breadwinner younger than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> saw its net worth shrink
by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 30 percent</NUMEX>; during that same time span, median family debt rose from
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$23,000 to $33,300</NUMEX>; and the percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> that own stock went from
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31.6 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48.8 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> and, notes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> , fewer
than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> don't have a checking account. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> stuff the story.

            In the half-full, half-empty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> headline reads,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">BOOM TIME A BAD TIME FOR POOREST, STUDY FINDS</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> 's reads:
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STOCK GAINS PROPEL U.S. WEALTH</ENAMEX>; MORE <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AMERICANS OWN SHARES</ENAMEX>."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> announced that he agrees with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Confederate</ENAMEX> battle flag should be removed
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Capitol building</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William F. Buckley Jr.</ENAMEX>, in an
LAT op-ed, says that the matter should be put to a national plebiscite.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buckley</ENAMEX> says that the flag doesn't enshrine slavery but rather "nostalgia and a
sense of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> idealism and cultural particularism." And he mentions a raft
of dead <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idealists</ENAMEX> who he thinks might well have voted to keep the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX> flag in place, but it's significant that he doesn't mention any living
ones. (For more on the politics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stars and Bars</ENAMEX>, click here.)

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> reports on Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> a story that in most alternative universes
would have been front-page news: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Rodham Clinton</ENAMEX> denies that she'll
leave her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> when he leaves the presidency. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRC</ENAMEX> says she will "spend the
rest of my life" with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> report that former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Angolan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> say their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonas Savimbi</ENAMEX>, ordered the shoot-down of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> that crashed
mysteriously on separate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days just over a year ago</TIMEX>, resulting in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> deaths.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Justice</ENAMEX> will announce today
that it will receive <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $500 million</NUMEX> (enough for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> missile tests) to
settle a health-care fraud case it brought against a national chain of kidney
dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> alleged that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> caused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> to
pay for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of needless tests for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and had paid
kickbacks to obtain referrals.

            In a WSJ commentary on the TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>/drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">czar</ENAMEX> flap, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Podhoretz</ENAMEX>
claims that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s attempt to influence the content of shows is
"nothing untoward." After all, he observes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> reviews scripts all
the time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">filmmakers</ENAMEX> seek to use its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and equipment. And the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">filmmakers</ENAMEX> don't protest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has exploited them. But <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s
modus ponens is another's modus tollens : The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>
script-vetting process seems outrageous to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today's Papers</ENAMEX>, all the more so
because unlike the drug-TV case, all the money and assets involved come from
public funds. Why should <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> only get to see war movies the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>
agrees with?
