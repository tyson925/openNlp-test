            Now we're getting somewhere. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX> asks, How is it that commerce can bring
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about</NUMEX> a change to the liberty of the Net? How is it any different from commerce
in real space? We don't ordinarily--we who are not <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reds</ENAMEX> at least--say that the
market in general reduces freedom. So why in cyberspace should it be any
different?

            The answer is simple: It's the architecture, um, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX> begins his questions with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 7</ENAMEX>; but I think the answers begin
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 1</ENAMEX>. For the argument of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part of my book is not that the
presence of commerce on the Net by itself reduces the liberty of the Net. If
the architecture of the Net remained as it was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, then it wouldn't matter
who uses the Net for what.

            My argument is that commerce is changing the architecture of the Net, and as
a byproduct of that change, the freedoms of the Net will change. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> is
bringing technologies to the Net that will reduce the initial liberties of the
Net--not because commerce is evil. Nor because it is against liberty. But
because the architectures that make commerce more efficient can also make
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> cheaper. The very architectures that make it possible to profit will
make it easier to regulate.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX> pointed to some of these architectures of freedom in his first post.
He said that "physical aggression against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> is ruled out in part by the
anonymous participation that is possible online." I'm not quite sure what he
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imagines</ENAMEX> here, but he is appealing to a feature of the Net to make his
argument: anonymity. But "anonymity" is not a natural or necessary feature of
the Internet. We could just as well imagine an Internet where transactions left
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fingerprints</ENAMEX>. And to the extent that they did, the consequence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>
points to would change. To the extent the Net were architected to limit, or
eliminate anonymity, a certain liberty of the original Net would change as
well.

            And this is precisely the kind of change my book describes. There is an
increasing push to layer onto the Net architectures that facilitate
identification and tracking. The technologies are many. I describe one
technology extensively in my book--the emergence of digital certificates that
will function as digital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDs</ENAMEX>. But there are any number of other examples that
make very same point: emerging architectures that make tracking and
identification easier.

            Think about "<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX>." Here's an architecture (in the sense I mean the term)
that was added to the Web by an innovation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape Corporation</ENAMEX>. That
innovation would, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netscape</ENAMEX> argued, make it easier for servers to track
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. When you contact a site, the site can deposit an entry in your
cookie file that will make it possible for that site to gather data about you
in the future.

            That change stripped away a certain amount of anonymity on the Net. Now
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">servers</ENAMEX> could watch where you browse; they could watch pages you skip to; they
could know something they didn't before. And all this because of a change in
the architecture.

            The point is not that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX> do no good. I love the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> knows
who I am and can recommend books to me when I come to their home page (they've
yet to recommend my book to me, but I'm sure they'll get around to that soon
enough). But the point is that the freedom that there was has been changed by a
change in the architecture. Sites now get data for free, because the
architecture makes it possible.

            But more important changes are just around the corner. For example:

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the fundamental architectural principles of the original Internet was
the principle of "end<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-to-end</TIMEX>." <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> described by network <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome</ENAMEX>
Saltzer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David P. Reed</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Clark</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">end-to-</TIMEX>end means that you keep the
network <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stupid</ENAMEX>, and build intelligence at the "ends"--in the applications, or
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> consequence of this design was that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> could not discriminate:
So long as you followed the basic Internet protocols, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> would carry
your traffic. And <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> consequence of this consequence of non-discrimination was
that new applications could be brought to the Net, even if they displaced the
dominant existing application. No one was in a position to discriminate against
a new entrant, because the Net was architected to disable discrimination.

            Enter broadband cable, at least under the architecture initially proposed by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>. After acquiring as many cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> as it could, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> and its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">affiliates</ENAMEX> are now converting the cable system so that it can carry the
Internet. But they are architecting this network very differently from how the
original Internet was architected. They are architecting it so that the network
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> gets to choose the Internet service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> that you get your broadband
Internet service from. And because the architecture allows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> to choose,
it allows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> to control how "its" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> gets used. If it doesn't want
you to stream video through your computer (a possible future with broadband)
because that competes with streaming video to your television set (the past
with cable), it now has the power to discriminate. And it has that power
because its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> has been architected to give it that power. It has been
architected, that is, to be different from the principle of non-discrimination
in the original Net.

            Now, these are not issues that ivory-tower <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">libertarians</ENAMEX> would ignore.
Indeed, I can imagine as I write this <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX> chafing to intervene and to say
that libertarianism has lots to say to these problems. (I was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>; I know his chafing very well.)
The libertarian would talk about externalities, and about minimum regulation to
avoid externalities, and about the value of common <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX>, and the like.

            But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cyber-libertarians</ENAMEX> say something different. They have been slow to
defend the principles of the initial architecture against the changes that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commerce</ENAMEX> would impose on that architecture. They have been slow because they
have been slow to see how the Net is changing. And more important, slow to see
how much of the freedom they enjoy comes not (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just</NUMEX>) from the absence of
government, but also from a constitution of freedom built into the architecture
of the Net.

            The argument of my book is that we ought to pay attention to this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constitution</ENAMEX>, and to the freedoms that this initial architecture gave us. And
that we ought to pay attention to the influences that are changing this
architecture, and therefore changing this freedom.

            You wouldn't disagree with that, would you <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>?
