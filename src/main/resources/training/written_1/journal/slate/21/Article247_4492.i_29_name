            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times lead with new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> indicators on the economy's
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> performance. The good news: growth remains impressive. The bad news:
long-awaited signs of inflation have finally materialized, and the markets know
it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> tucks the story inside, and leads
instead with the latest glitches in implementing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern Ireland</ENAMEX> peace
deal.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>' stories on the economic reports are virtually identical. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> as a whole in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the final quarter of the year</TIMEX>,
wage and benefits costs to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> swelled by a higher-than-expected
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.1%</NUMEX>. With interest rate hikes a foregone conclusion, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.6%</NUMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> slid <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.77%</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> are predicting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.5%</NUMEX> target
for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> interest rates to climb by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as a half</NUMEX> point. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prognosticators</ENAMEX> almost sound relieved to finally touch and feel the signs of
inflation they've been expecting for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. "It's as if there's been a murder,
and we still don't have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, but now <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> evidence are starting to
come in," <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> tells the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> .

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish Republican Army</ENAMEX> will miss its crucial
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> deadline for beginning to disarm. An impasse on disarmament could
paralyze the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-month-old</TIMEX> power-sharing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belfast</ENAMEX> and may
ultimately spur the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> to re-impose direct rule. The piece does not speculate
on what's holding the IRA back: internal dissent, desire to alter the details
of the signed agreement, or sheer bad faith.

            In a striking contrast to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s reports about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> prosperity, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> front-pager says that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> has resorted to borrowing directly from
local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> to repay its debts. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Countries</ENAMEX> in debt usually prefer raising bonds,
which are cheaper to finance than regular loans, but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> seems skittish about
issuing new bonds, which could upset its bond market or provoke scrutiny from
credit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">front-pager</ENAMEX> lends credence to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX>'s recent assertions
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> has lied about his record. According to the story, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> has
successfully "identified several glaring misstatements or distortions by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX>." Among other things, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> contended that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> didn't take a
stand on campaign finance until he ran for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> (Actually, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>
co-sponsored several campaign finance reform bills during his time in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This week</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> alleged that he has "always supported a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s right
to choose." But early in his congressional career, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> denounced abortion.

            A piece on the front page of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> bashes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> promise to use <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4 billion</NUMEX> in government funds to bridge the
so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> Divide between wired haves and unwired have-nots. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>
Divide "is all but gone," argues the story, citing several studies that show
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latinos</ENAMEX> flocking to the Internet in droves. "Despite such evidence,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> politics, a booming economy, and an unskeptical press have combined
to raise the notion of a digital divide from a contentious statistical claim to
a cause celebre," it accuses. While the piece dismisses the idea of a racial
split between Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> and non-Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, it does acknowledge gaps
based on economics and education. If this is so, then why is helping more
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> get online a "waste of money"?

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> report that for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, the federal
government is admitting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> who handled early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of nuclear
weapons were sickened by cancer-causing radiation. "In the past, the role of
government was to take a hike," <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Richardson</ENAMEX> said, "and I
think that was wrong." The story predicts that the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> will soon
have to shell out <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens of millions of dollars</NUMEX> a year in compensation.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> reported that as part of their welfare-to-work
efforts, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have been recruiting former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> for
jobs as telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychics</ENAMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clairvoyance</ENAMEX> is not among the qualifications
listed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s recruitment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flier</ENAMEX>. Any public assistance recipient with a
high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> equivalency degree, 'a caring and compassionate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality</ENAMEX>' and
the 'ability to read, write, and speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>'" could qualify, the story
reported. According to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>, the program was killed yesterday
after the story raised a fit of scorn. Apparently no one was more upset than
the professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">astrologers</ENAMEX>, who consider the new recruits inadequately
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">schooled</ENAMEX> in, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> of Astrological
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federation of America</ENAMEX> put it, "astrological studies that have been around for
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>."
