            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Peggy</ENAMEX>,

            You, of course, get right to the heart of the matter: A good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> never
follows a method to the letter. And if you're the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> who's lucky
enough to have a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>, you rarely find yourself worrying about whether
the method being employed is traditional or progressive, whether there's enough
breadth or enough depth. What's more, neither do your fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>--even if
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are not at all the kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> yours are: Good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> seem
to manage to find ways to fit the needs of many different sorts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in
the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>. It's during the lousy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> with weak <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> that we parents
suddenly find ourselves being led from our particular complaints to ask bigger
questions about the whole approach of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, and being tempted to think in
unduly polarized terms--as if there was some clear-cut choice between
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constructivist</ENAMEX> and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>-directed learning.

            I suppose an important question to ask, which is not at all the focus of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>'s book but should presumably be part of the debate about curricular
reform, is what sort of guidance proves most helpful to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> and most
conducive to attracting good ones to the profession. Do you, for example, think
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Core</ENAMEX> lesson plans could be useful background material for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> who
felt free to take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> or more to do her own version of what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hirsch</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">allotted</ENAMEX>, say, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 days</TIMEX> to cover? I couldn't tell from my quick peek what the
quality of the bibliographies was. We all hear constantly that strong
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> play a large part in creating strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, but I was struck that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> had very little to say about them and their role--except as the last
resort for disgruntled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. What do the best of them do to help set a
school's academic direction? This book has notably little to say about what
sort of changes could help most to raise the quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX>, which they evidently consider to be pretty low.

            But if anything is to be accomplished, it's clear they think school choice
is the way. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, are in favor of a voucher plan that would allow
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to choose among not just public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, but private and parochial and
charter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> as well. In fact, the program of constant oversight and
pressure this book <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> almost doesn't make sense, or is merely a recipe
for frustration, if there isn't school choice: "Start hunting for a different
school," they urge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> whose complaints haven't born fruit. But what do you
do if you can't afford, or get your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> into, a private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and don't want
him to attend parochial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>? If you don't have at least some public-school
alternatives to consider, you <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stew</ENAMEX>. It does seem somewhat surprising, though,
to hear these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> defend their voucher plan on the grounds that it fosters
"pluralism in schooling," after pushing a shared curriculum as hard as they
do.

            I haven't thought as much as I should have about school choice, but the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> I know who have been able to pick from a variety of public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> have
been glad of it--and have stuck with the public-school system when they
otherwise would have left. As a spur to improvements in the system, given the
slow pace of top-down efforts at reform, it seems worth trying out in different
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX>, but it shouldn't be considered a cure-all, especially for the worst-off
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. Nor, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Traub</ENAMEX> pointed out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Magazine</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last weekend</TIMEX>, are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> themselves a cure-all for poverty. But if the result
of school choice is to isolate failing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> even further than they already
are from pressures that might lead to improving them, it would be a failure for
reform.

            This book has the unintended effect of exposing the unappealing side of the
school-choice crusade: The ideal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> of these pages does not remind me much
of an upstanding, civic-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX>--the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patriot</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> presumably
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">admires</ENAMEX>. Instead, the micromanaging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> conjured up here resemble
demanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>, obsessed with promoting their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s future and convinced
that school and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> should revolve around their needs and demands. What
kind of respect for our common culture is that? For old-fashioned
honor-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thy</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>-and-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>-and-country types, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> convey a
surprisingly ruthless '90s get-ahead attitude. Do you agree? The message to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> makes me more tired than I already am of marketplace values. Along with
that moral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compass</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> has urged, it seems we better whip out our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palm</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pilots</ENAMEX>, and fast: "You must be the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trainer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX>, and role
model."

            This has been fun, and you've made me think that what I'd really like to
have on my shelf--and read--is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>'s guide for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>.
