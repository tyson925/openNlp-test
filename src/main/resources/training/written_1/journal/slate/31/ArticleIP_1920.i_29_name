            Like most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who once
hoped for better, I have become resigned to the accumulation of tawdry detail
about how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> financed his re-election campaign. But condemning
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s brazen opportunism begs the question: Where did the opportunities to
be so brazen come from?

            This may
seem to be a question for a political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX>, not an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX>. But there is
an approach to political analysis known as "rat choice" (rat as in
"rational"--it's not a comment on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>) that flourishes along the
border of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX>. The working hypothesis of rat choice is that voting
behavior reflects the more or less rational pursuit of individual interests.
This may sound obvious, innocuous, and even excessively optimistic. But if you
really think its implications through, they turn out to be quite subversive.
Indeed, if you take rat choice seriously, you stop asking why democracy works
so badly and start asking why it works at all.

            What is the problem? Won't rational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> simply choose
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> who promise to serve their interests? Well, in a rough sense they
do. The logic of democratic politics normally pushes both parties toward the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>--more precisely, toward policies that serve the interests of the median
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">voter</ENAMEX>. Consider, for example, the question of how big the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> should be.
In general, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with low incomes prefer a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> that imposes high taxes
in order to provide generous benefits. Those with high incomes prefer a
government that does no such thing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> are, by inclination, the
party of outstretched <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> of tight fists. But both
are forced to move away from those inclinations toward actual policies that
more or less satisfy the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> in the middle, who don't like paying taxes but
do like knowing that they won't be stuck with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grandma</ENAMEX>'s medical bills.

            But there
are lots of issues that are not so big--issues that only involve, say, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10</NUMEX> or
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>--like who profits from electricity deregulation, or how much
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> spends subsidizing irrigation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> for Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>.
Although these issues, cumulatively, are important to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electorate</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">electorate</ENAMEX> doesn't vote--individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> do. And it is rarely in the interest
of the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter</ENAMEX> to take the trouble to track the details of public
policy. After all, how much difference will one vote make?

            
Bells have just started going off in the head
of any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> who remembers <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Econ 1</ENAMEX>. What I have just said is that the duties of
a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX>--such as becoming well informed before voting (and for that
matter bothering to vote at all)--are subject to the dreaded free-rider
problem . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-rider</ENAMEX> problem arises whenever some valuable good or
service is not "excludable"--that is, whenever the benefit cannot be restricted
only to those who pay for it. It is clearly in the interest of all boaters to
have a rescue service. But no individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boater</ENAMEX> has any incentive to pay for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> if others are willing to do so. If we leave provision of a
lifesaving service up to individual decisions, each individual will try to
free-ride on everyone else, and the service will be inadequate or worse.

            The
solution is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. It is in the collective interest of boaters that each
boat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> be required to pay a fee, to support a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> that provides
those nonexcludable benefits. And the same is true of police protection, public
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sanitation</ENAMEX>, national defense, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers for Disease Control</ENAMEX>, and so on. The
free-rider problem is the most important reason all sane <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> concede that we
need a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> with some coercive power--the power, if nothing else, to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force people</ENAMEX> to pay taxes whether or not they feel like it.

            But there is a catch: The democratic process, the only
decent way we know for deciding how that coercive power should be used, is
itself subject to extremely severe free-rider problems. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rat</ENAMEX>-choice theorist
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Popkin</ENAMEX> writes (in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> book, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Reasoning Voter</ENAMEX> ):
"Everybody's business is nobody's business. If everyone spends <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an additional</TIMEX>
hour evaluating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, we all benefit from a better-informed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electorate</ENAMEX>. If everyone but me spends <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the hour</TIMEX> evaluating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> and I
spend it choosing where to invest my savings, I will get a better return on my
investments as well as a better <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>." As a result, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> at large
is, entirely rationally, remarkably ill-informed about politics and policy. And
that leaves the field open for special interests--which means <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with a
large stake in small issues--to buy policies that suit them.

            For example, not many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>
know or care whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> uses a substantial amount of its
diplomatic capital to open <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> markets to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Central American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX>. Why
should they? (I only keep track of the dispute because I have to update my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">textbook</ENAMEX>, which includes the sentence: "Efforts to resolve <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX>
split have proved fruitless.") But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Lindner</ENAMEX>, the corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raider</ENAMEX> who now
owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiquita Brands</ENAMEX>, has strong feelings about the issue; and thanks to his
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500,000</NUMEX> in contributions, so does <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. It's not that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
believed that money alone could buy him the election. But money does help, and
any practical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> comes to realize that betraying the public interest on
small issues involves little political cost, because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> lack the individual
incentive to notice.

            So what is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX>?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> answer
is to try to change the incentives of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>, by making it more difficult
for special interests to buy influence. It is easy to be cynical about this,
but the truth is that legal limits on how money can be given do have
considerable effect. To take only the most extreme example: Outright bribes do
not, as far as we can tell, play a big role in determining federal
policies--and who doubts that they would if they were legal? So by all means
let us have campaign-finance reform; but let us not expect too much from
it.

            
Another answer is to promote civic virtue.
There are those who believe that if only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> would treat the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> with
proper respect, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would respond by acting responsibly--that they would
turn away from salacious stories about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> and read earnest articles
about the flat-panel-display initiative instead. Well, never mind. But it is
probably true that the quality of politics in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> has suffered from the
erosion of public trust in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> that used to act, to at least some
degree, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">watchdogs</ENAMEX>. Once upon a time a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> had to worry about the
reactions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>, even local political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bosses</ENAMEX>,
all of whom had the time and inclination to pay attention to politics beyond
the sound bites. Now we have become an atomized society of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who get
their news--if they get it at all--from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TV</ENAMEX>. If anyone has a good idea about how
to bring back the opinion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of yore, I am all for it.

            Finally, we can try to
remove temptation, by avoiding policy initiatives that make it easy for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> to play favorites. This is one reason why some of us cringed when
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Brown</ENAMEX> began taking planeloads of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> off on sales trips to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>
and so on. Whether or not those trips did any good, or gave the wrong
impression about how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> might influence <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> foreign policy, they
obviously raised the question of who got to be on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>--and how.

            But there is ultimately no
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> truly be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. That
is what rat choice teaches, and nobody has yet proved it wrong--even in
theory.
