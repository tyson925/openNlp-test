            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Earth Day</ENAMEX> is upon us once
again. Like most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who think at all about how much burden their way of
life places on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spaceship Earth</ENAMEX>, I feel a bit guilty. But my conscience is
clearer than usual <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>--and so are those of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX>.

            Let me
explain. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few months ago</TIMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redefining Progress</ENAMEX> enlisted
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laureates</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Solow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenneth Arrow</ENAMEX>, together
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Jorgenson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Nordhaus</ENAMEX>, and myself--to
circulate an "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Economists' Statement on Climate Change</ENAMEX>," calling for serious
measures to limit the emission of greenhouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX>. To be honest, I agreed to
be one of the original signatories mainly as a gesture of goodwill, and never
expected to hear any more about it; but the statement ended up being signed by,
yes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX>. Whatever else may come of the enterprise, it
was an impressive demonstration of a little-known fact: Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> are
also enthusiastic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX>.

            Partly this is just because of who <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> are: Being by
definition well-educated and, for the most part, pretty well-off, they have the
usual prejudices of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>--and most upper-middle-class <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are
sentimental about the environment, as long as protecting it does not impinge on
their lifestyle. (I'm happy to reuse my grocery bags--but don't expect me to
walk to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarket</ENAMEX>.) But my unscientific impression is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> are
on average more pro-environment than other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of similar incomes and
backgrounds. Why? Because standard economic theory automatically predisposes
those who believe in it to favor strong environmental protection.

            This is
not, of course, the popular image. Everyone knows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> are people
who know the price of everything and the value of nothing, who think that
anything that increases gross domestic product is good and anything else is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">worthless</ENAMEX>, and who believe that whatever free markets do must be right. (A
recent example of how this stereotype gets perpetuated is the article by
garden-shop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Hawken</ENAMEX> in the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother Jones</ENAMEX> . I'm
sorry to say that some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redefining Progress</ENAMEX> published an
impressively ill-informed diatribe along the same lines in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>
back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>.)

            
But the reality is that even the most
conventional economic doctrine is a lot more subtle than that. True, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX>
generally believe that a system of free markets is a pretty efficient way to
run an economy, as long as the prices are right --as long, in particular,
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> pay the true social cost of their actions. Environmental issues,
however, more or less by definition involve situations in which the price is
wrong--in which the private costs of an activity fail to reflect its true
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> costs. Let me quote from the textbook (by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Baumol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blinder</ENAMEX>) that I assigned when I taught <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economics 1</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>: "When a firm
pollutes a river, it uses some of society's resources just as surely as when it
burns <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX>. However, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> pays for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX> but not for the use of clean
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, it is to be expected that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> will be economical in its use of
coal and wasteful in its use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>." In other words, when it comes to the
environment, we do not expect the free market to get it right.

            So what
should be done? Going all the way back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Samuelson</ENAMEX>'s first edition in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX>, every economics textbook I know of has argued that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> should
intervene in the market to discourage activities that damage the environment.
The usual recommendation is to do so either by charging fees for the right to
engage in such nasty activities--a k a "pollution taxes"--or by auctioning off
rights to pollute. Indeed, as the extraordinary response to the climate-change
statement reminds us, the idea of pollution taxes is one of those iconic
positions, like free trade, that commands the assent of virtually every
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">card-carrying</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX>. Yet while <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollution</ENAMEX> and related "negative
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">externalities</ENAMEX>" such as traffic congestion are obvious problems, in practice,
efforts to make markets take environmental costs into account are few and far
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between</TIMEX>. So <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> who actually believe the things they teach generally
support a much more aggressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> of environmental protection than the one
we actually have. True, they tend to oppose detailed regulations that tell
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> exactly how they must reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollution</ENAMEX>, preferring schemes that provide
a financial incentive to pollute less but leave the details up to the private
sector. But I would be hard pressed to think of a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> not actually
employed by an anti-environmental lobbying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> who believes that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> should protect the environment less, not more, than it currently
does. (The signers of the climate-change statement, incidentally, included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago</ENAMEX>.)

            But won't protecting the environment reduce the gross
domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">product</ENAMEX>? Not necessarily--and anyway, so what?

            At first
sight, it might seem obvious that pollution taxes will reduce GDP. After all,
any tax reduces the incentives to work, save, and invest. Thus a tax on exhaust
emissions from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> will induce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to drive cleaner <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> or avoid driving
altogether. But since it will also in effect lower the payoff to earning extra
money (since you wouldn't end up driving the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> you could buy with that
money anyway), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will not work as hard as they would have without the tax.
The result is that taxes on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollution</ENAMEX> (or anything else) will, other things
being equal, tend to reduce overall monetary output in the economy--which is to
say, GDP.

            
But things need not be equal, because there is
already a whole lot of taxing and spending going on. Even in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>,
where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is smaller than in any other advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, about a
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of GDP passes through its hands. So existing taxes already discourage
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from engaging in taxable activities like working or investing.

            What this
means is that the revenue from any new taxes on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollution</ENAMEX> could be used to
reduce other taxes, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> contributions or the income tax
(but not, of course, the capital-gains tax). While the pollution taxes would
discourage some activities that are counted in the GDP, the reduction in other
taxes would encourage other such activities. So measured GDP might well fall
very little, or even rise.

            Does this constitute an independent argument for taxing
pollution, quite aside from its environmental payoff? Would we want to have,
say, a carbon tax even if we weren't worried about global warming? Well, there
has been an excruciatingly technical argument about this, mysteriously known as
the "double dividend" debate; the general consensus seems to be no, and that on
balance pollution taxes would be more likely to reduce GDP slightly than to
increase it.

            But so
what? "Gross domestic product is not a measure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s economic
well-being"--so declares the textbook as soon as it introduces the concept. If
getting the price of the environment right means a rise in consumption of
nonmarket goods like clean air and leisure time at the expense of marketed
consumption, so be it.

            
Isn't this amazing? Not only do <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> agree on something, but what they agree on is the warm and cuddly
idea that we should do more to protect the environment. Can <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> be
wrong? Well, yes--but this time they aren't. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Great Green Tax Shift</ENAMEX>--a shift
away from taxes on employment and income toward taxes on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollution</ENAMEX> and other
negative externalities--has everything going for it. It is supported by good
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science</ENAMEX> and good economics, as well as by good intentions.

            
Inevitably, then, it appears at the moment to be a complete political
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonstarter</ENAMEX>. The problem, as with many good policy ideas, is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>
Green <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tax Shift</ENAMEX> runs up against the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">I's</ENAMEX>.

            First, there is Ignorance. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Only last year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> rushed
to cut gasoline taxes to offset a temporary price rise. Not many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> stopped
to ask where the money was coming from. So what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> will be foolish
enough to take the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in trying to institute new taxes on all-American
pollution, even with the assurance that other taxes will be lowered at the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>? (My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> tell me that the word "taxes" has been
banned even from internal discussions about environmental policy.)

            Then there are Interests. It
is hard to think of a way to limit global warming that will not gradually
reduce the number of coal-mining jobs. As labor-market adjustment problems go,
this is a pretty small <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners</ENAMEX> and the energy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> are
actively opposed to green taxes, while the broader <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> that would benefit
from them is not actively in support.

            Finally, there is Ideology.
It used to be that the big problem in formulating a sensible environmental
policy came from the left--from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who insisted that since pollution is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evil</ENAMEX>, it is immoral to put a price on it. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX>, however, the main problem
comes from the right--from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> who, unlike most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX>, really do
think that the free market is always right--to such an extent that they refuse
to believe even the most overwhelming scientific evidence if it seems to
suggest a justification for government action.

            So I do not, realistically,
expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economists</ENAMEX>' Statement to change the world. But then I didn't expect
it to go as far as it has. Certainly those of us who signed it did the right
thing; and maybe, just maybe, we did our bit toward saving the planet.
