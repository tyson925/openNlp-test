            Imagine an economy that
produces <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> things: hot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and buns. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Consumers</ENAMEX> in this economy insist
that every hot dog come with a bun, and vice versa. And labor is the only input
to production.

            OK, timeout. Before we go
any further, I need to ask what you think of an essay that begins this way.
Does it sound silly to you? Were you about to turn the virtual page, figuring
that this couldn't be about anything important?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the points of this
column is to illustrate a paradox: You can't do serious economics unless you
are willing to be playful. Economic theory is not a collection of dictums laid
down by pompous authority figures. Mainly, it is a menagerie of thought
experiments--parables, if you like--that are intended to capture the logic of
economic processes in a simplified way. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, of course, ideas must be
tested against the facts. But even to know what facts are relevant, you must
play with those ideas in hypothetical settings. And I use the word "play"
advisedly: Innovative thinkers, in economics and other disciplines, often have
a pronounced whimsical streak.

            It so happens that I am
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> to use my hot-dog-and-bun example to talk about technology, jobs, and the
future of capitalism. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> who feel that big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> can only be properly
addressed in big books--which present big ideas, using big words--will find my
intellectual style offensive. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> imagine that when they write or quote
such books, they are being profound. But more often than not, they're being
profoundly foolish. And the best way to avoid such foolishness is to play
around with a thought experiment or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.

            So let's continue. Suppose
that our economy initially employs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, which corresponds more
or less to full employment. It takes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>-days to produce either a hot
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> or a bun. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, realism is not the point here.) Assuming that the economy
produces what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> want, it must be producing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hot dogs</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> buns <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> will be employed in each sector.

            Now,
suppose that improved technology allows a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> to produce a hot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> in one
day rather than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. And suppose that the economy makes use of this increased
productivity to increase consumption to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 million</NUMEX> hot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> with buns a day.
This requires some reallocation of labor, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 40 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> now
producing hot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80 million</NUMEX> producing buns.

            Then a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">famous journalist</ENAMEX> arrives on the scene. He takes a
look at recent history and declares that something terrible has happened:
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty million</NUMEX> hot-dog jobs have been destroyed . When he looks deeper
into the matter, he discovers that the output of hot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> has actually risen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>
percent, yet employment has declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 percent</NUMEX>. He begins <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a two-year</TIMEX>
research project, touring the globe as he talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>, government
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, and labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>. The picture becomes increasingly clear to him:
Supply is growing at a breakneck pace, and there just isn't enough consumer
demand to go around. True, jobs are still being created in the bun sector; but
soon enough the technological revolution will destroy those jobs too. Global
capitalism, in short, is hurtling toward crisis. He writes up his alarming
conclusions in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">473</NUMEX>-page book; full of startling facts about the changes
underway in technology and the global market; larded with phrases in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, and even <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX>; and punctuated with occasional barbed remarks
about the blinkered vision of conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX>. The book is widely
acclaimed for its erudition and sophistication, and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> becomes a lion
of the talk-show circuit.

            Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> are a
bit bemused, because they can't quite understand his point. Yes, technological
change has led to a shift in the industrial structure of employment. But there
has been no net job loss; and there is no reason to expect such a loss in the
future. After all, suppose that productivity were to double in buns as well as
hot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>. Why couldn't the economy simply take advantage of that higher
productivity to raise consumption to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">60 million</NUMEX> hot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> with buns, employing
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in each sector?

            Or, to put
it a different way: Productivity growth in one sector can very easily reduce
employment in that sector . But to suppose that productivity growth
reduces employment in the economy as a whole is a very different matter.
In our hypothetical economy it is--or should be--obvious that reducing the
number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> it takes to make a hot dog reduces the number of jobs in the
hot-dog sector but creates an equal number in the bun sector, and vice versa.
Of course, you would never learn that from talking to hot-dog <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX>, no
matter how many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> you visit; you might not even learn it from talking
to bun <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX>. It is an insight that you can gain only by playing with
hypothetical economies--by engaging in thought experiments.

            
At this point, I imagine that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> have
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> objections.

            First, isn't my thought
experiment too simple to tell us anything about the real world?

            No, not at all. For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
thing, if for "hot dogs" you substitute "manufactures" and for "buns" you
substitute "services," my story actually looks quite a lot like the history of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past generation</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1970</TIMEX> and the present, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX>'s output of manufactures roughly doubled; but, because of increases in
productivity, employment actually declined slightly. The production of services
also roughly doubled--but there was little productivity improvement, and
employment grew by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX>. Overall, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 45</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> jobs. So in the real economy, as in the parable, productivity growth in
one sector seems to have led to job gains in the other.

            But there
is a deeper point: A simple story is not the same as a simplistic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. Even our
little parable reveals possibilities that no amount of investigative reporting
could uncover. It suggests, in particular, that what might seem to a naive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentator</ENAMEX> like a natural conclusion--if productivity growth in the steel
industry reduces the number of jobs for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">steelworkers</ENAMEX>, then productivity growth
in the economy as a whole reduces employment in the economy as a whole--may
well involve a crucial fallacy of composition.

            But wait--what entitles me to assume that consumer demand
will rise enough to absorb all the additional production? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> good answer is:
Why not? If production were to double, and all that production were to be sold,
then total income would double too; so why wouldn't consumption double? That
is, why should there be a shortfall in consumption merely because the economy
produces more?

            Here
again, however, there is a deeper answer. It is possible for economies
to suffer from an overall inadequacy of demand--recessions do happen. However,
such slumps are essentially monetary --they come about because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> try
in the aggregate to hold more cash than there actually is in circulation. (That
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insight</ENAMEX> is the essence of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Keynesian</ENAMEX> economics.) And they can usually be cured
by issuing more money--full stop, end of story. An overall excess of production
capacity (compared to what?) has nothing at all to do with it.

            
Perhaps the biggest objection to my hot-dog
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parable</ENAMEX> is that final bit about the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX>. Surely, no respected
figure would write a whole book on the world economy based on such a
transparent fallacy. And even if he did, nobody would take him seriously.

            But while the
hot-dog-and-bun economy is hypothetical, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> is not. Rolling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William B. Greider</ENAMEX> has just published a widely heralded new
book titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">One World, Ready or Not: The Manic Logic of Global</ENAMEX>
Capitalism . And his book is exactly as I have described it: a massive,
panoramic description of the world economy, which piles fact upon fact (some of
the crucial facts turn out to be wrong, but that is another issue) in apparent
demonstration of the thesis that global supply is outrunning global demand.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, all the facts are irrelevant to that thesis; for they amount to no more
than the demonstration that there are many industries in which growing
productivity and the entry of new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> has led to a loss of traditional
jobs--that is, that hot-dog production is up, but hot-dog employment is down.
Nobody, it seems, warned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greider</ENAMEX> that he needed to worry about fallacies of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">composition</ENAMEX>, that the logic of the economy as a whole is not the same as the
logic of a single market.

            I think I
know what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greider</ENAMEX> would answer: that while I am talking mere theory, his
argument is based on the evidence. The fact, however, is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy
has added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 million</NUMEX> jobs over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 25 years</TIMEX>--far more jobs have been added
in the service sector than have been lost in manufacturing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greider</ENAMEX>'s view, if
I understand it, is that this is just a reprieve--that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any day</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX>, the whole
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX> will start looking like the steel industry. But this is a purely
theoretical prediction. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greider</ENAMEX>'s theorizing is all the more speculative
and simplistic because he is an accidental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorist</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorist</ENAMEX> despite
himself--because he and his unwary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> imagine that his conclusions simply
emerge from the facts, unaware that they are driven by implicit assumptions
that could not survive the light of day.

            Needless to say, I have little hope that the general
public, or even most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX>, will realize what a thoroughly silly book
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greider</ENAMEX> has written. After all, it looks anything but silly--it seems
knowledgeable and encyclopedic, and is written in a tone of high seriousness.
It strains credibility to assert the truth, which is that the main lesson one
really learns from those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">473</NUMEX> pages is how easy it is for an intelligent,
earnest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> to trip over his own intellectual shoelaces.

            Why did it
happen? Part of the answer is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greider</ENAMEX> systematically cut himself off from
the kind of advice and criticism that could have saved him from himself. His
acknowledgements conspicuously do not include any competent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX>--not a
surprising thing, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> supposes, for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who describes economics as "not
really a science so much as a value-laden form of prophecy." But I also suspect
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greider</ENAMEX> is the victim of his own earnestness. He clearly takes his subject
(and himself) too seriously to play intellectual games. To test-drive an idea
with seemingly trivial thought experiments, with hypothetical stories about
simplified economies producing hot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and buns, would be beneath his dignity.
And it is precisely because he is so serious that his ideas are so foolish.
