            By now there have been
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of articles explaining why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX>'s economic plan, which relies on
the magic of supply-side tax cuts, won't work. And there have been <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds</NUMEX>
more explaining why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>, whose contempt for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who believe in that kind of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">magic</ENAMEX> is a matter of public record, nonetheless chose to accept their
program--and chose one of the most prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">believers</ENAMEX> as his running mate. I
have nothing to add to all of that. But it seems to me that the success of the
tax cutters in taking over yet another presidential campaign requires a deeper
explanation. Why does supply-side economics have such durability?

            It should
go without saying that the supply-side idea--which is that tax cuts have such a
positive effect on the economy that one need not worry about paying for them
with spending cuts--does not persist because of any actual evidence in its
favor. If you want, any nonpartisan <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> can explain to you at length what
really happened during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, and why you can't seriously claim his
record as an advertisement for supply-side policies. But surely it is enough to
look at the extraordinary recent record of the supply-siders as economic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forecasters</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> had pushed through an
increase in taxes on upper-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, the very same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">persuaded Dole</ENAMEX> to run on a tax-cut <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> were very sure about what would
happen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX> confidently predicted a severe recession. Articles in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forbes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> urged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> to get out of the stock market to avoid
the inevitable crash. The Wall 
               Street 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> editorial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">page</ENAMEX> had no doubts that the tax increase would sharply increase the deficit
instead of reducing it. Well here we are, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years later</TIMEX>: The economy has
created <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 million</NUMEX> new jobs, the market is up by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1500</NUMEX> points, and the deficit
has been cut in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>. I'm not saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s policies led to that
result--they account for only part of the good news about the deficit, and
hardly any of the rest. But the point is that the supply-siders were absolutely
sure that his policies would produce disaster--and indeed, if their doctrine
had any truth to it, they would have.

            Nor, I would argue, do supply-side views spread because
they are good politics. True, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> won on a supply-side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>--but
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspects</ENAMEX> he would have won on almost any <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>, and that the taunts of
"voodoo economics" actually cost him some votes. Today, the supply-side label
is a clear liability. Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of the concept shy away from the label. In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Armey</ENAMEX> chose to conceal the
extent of their tax-cutting fervor from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>, who they judged would not
trust an economic program based on supply-side assumptions. And the word is
that even <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>--the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that were used to craft the
Contract With <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> --have reacted scornfully to the idea of an
election-year tax-cut promise. This is partly, of course, because they doubt it
will really happen. But it is also because they doubt it would have the
promised beneficial effect.

            So why
does the supply-side idea keep on resurfacing? Probably because of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> key
attributes that it shares with certain other doctrines, like belief in the gold
standard: It appeals to the prejudices of extremely rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, and it offers
self-esteem to the intellectually insecure.

            
The support of rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> is not a small matter.
Despite its centrality to political debate, economic research is a very
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">low-budget</ENAMEX> affair. The entire <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> economics budget at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Science</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foundation</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $20 million</NUMEX>. What this means is that even a handful of
wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cranks</ENAMEX> can support an impressive-looking array of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">think tanks</ENAMEX>, research
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institutes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX>, and so on devoted to promoting an economic doctrine
they like. (The role of a few key funders, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olin Foundations</ENAMEX>,
in building an intellectual facade for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 20 th -century</TIMEX>
conservatism is a story that somebody needs to write.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> can attract are not exactly the best and the brightest.
Supply-side <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troubadour</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jude Wanniski</ENAMEX> has lately been reduced to employing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lyndon LaRouche</ENAMEX>. But who needs brilliant, or even competent,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> when you already know all the answers?

            The
appeal to the intellectually insecure is also more important than it might
seem. Because economics touches so much of life, everyone wants to have an
opinion. Yet the kind of economics covered in the textbooks is a technical
subject that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> find hard to follow. How reassuring, then, to be told
that it is all irrelevant--that all you really need to know are a few simple
ideas! Quite a few supply-siders have created for themselves a wonderful
alternative intellectual history in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Maynard Keynes</ENAMEX> was a fraud, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paul</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samuelson</ENAMEX> and even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton Friedman</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fools</ENAMEX>, and the true line of deep
economic thought runs from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam Smith</ENAMEX> through obscure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">turn-of-the-century</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Austrians</ENAMEX> straight to them.

            And so it doesn't really matter whether supply-side
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">economics</ENAMEX> makes any sense, or even whether it goes down to a crushing electoral
defeat. The supply-siders will always have a safe haven in the world of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Free</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enterprise Institutes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers for the Study of Capitalism</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> for
their views in the pages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forbes</ENAMEX> and the Wall 
               Street

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> , and new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> who never tire of saying the same things again
and again. When I was younger I thought that ridicule could eventually bring
the whole farce to an end, but now I know better. Presumably the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> are
right, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>'s desperate ploy will fail. But while that will be the end of
him, the supply-siders will be back.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biologist Richard Dawkins</ENAMEX> has
argued famously that ideas spread from mind to mind much as viruses spread from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>. It's an exhilaratingly cynical view, because it suggests that to
succeed, an idea need not be true or even useful, as long as it has what it
takes to propagate itself. (A religious faith that disposes its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">believers</ENAMEX> to
become martyrs may be quite false, and lethal to its adherents, yet persist if
each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">martyr</ENAMEX> inspires others.) Supply-side economics, then, is like one of those
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> viruses that, however often it may be eradicated from the settled
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>, is always out there in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX>, waiting for new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>. I had expected
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX>, with his worldliness and sharp wit, to have stronger immunity than
most. But weakness in the polls made him vulnerable, and he will never
recover.
