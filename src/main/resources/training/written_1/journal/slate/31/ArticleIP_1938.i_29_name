            Surely it cannot have
surprised anyone to learn that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> is run by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crooks</ENAMEX>. The question has always
been: What kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crooks</ENAMEX> are they? Are they serious kleptocrats, in it for the
long haul, or are they looters, out to take the money and run? The essence of
the financial crisis that has rocked the world in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few weeks</TIMEX> is this:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX>, which means anyone with money at stake, appear to have decided, once
and for all, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who run <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> are not only corrupt but
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shortsightedly</ENAMEX> so--that they are looters rather than kleptocrats.

            Of
course, to get at this essence you have to dig a little. On the surface,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s troubles seem like the sort of thing that happens even to respectable
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. Even basically well-governed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> are subject to currency
crises--remember, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Soros</ENAMEX> became a household word with his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> attack on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> pound. Nor are banking problems necessarily confined to places with
unstable or corrupt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>; the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">thrifts</ENAMEX> comes to mind,
and even squeaky clean <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX> had a banking debacle in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>. So you might
think that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s woes are simply a souped-up version of the kind of
financial crises many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> have experienced. Indeed, if you read the
official reports of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX>, that's
the way they portray things.

            But these surface similarities deceive. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> was
vulnerable to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, because there was a sound, if not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">universally</ENAMEX> accepted, economic case for devaluation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s overvalued
currency was contributing to its high unemployment rate. (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is
vulnerable to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> right now for the same reason.) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> today, by
contrast, is a largely de-monetized economy, in which many, perhaps most,
transactions take place through barter. As far as most of the economy is
concerned, the value and even the existence of the ruble have become more or
less irrelevant. Nor are the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> that have just crashed really banks
in the Western sense of the word. By and large they have few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">depositors</ENAMEX>. Mainly
they are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> of borrowing money from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> and using it to
speculate in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> markets, above all in the market for government debt.
Essentially, instead of borrowing money directly from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
government has relied on a layer of politically connected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">middlemen</ENAMEX> to act as
conveyors of foreign funds.

            This
wouldn't matter so much, except that that government borrowing has spiraled out
of control. The reason is not excessive spending--on the contrary, the
government has let many basic services lapse and has become erratic at best
about paying its own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> (notably, and frighteningly, the military).
Instead, the problem is an inability to collect taxes.

            
You might be tempted to attribute this
inability to raise taxes to administrative incompetence in a country
unaccustomed to dealing with free markets. But with its industrial base
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shriveled</ENAMEX> and the dollar value of gross domestic product stunningly low even
before the recent collapse--<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s dollar GDP was about the same as that
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s economy is now dominated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> of a handful of
exportable resources such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>. These sorts of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">traditional</ENAMEX>, homogeneous commodities are the kinds of thing that even primitive
administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> normally are able to tax. What is more, the
insider-driven process of privatization--in which state assets were in effect
distributed to political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX>, much as a medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> might assign
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dukedoms</ENAMEX> to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenants</ENAMEX>--has led to highly concentrated ownership of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>. It has been suggested, in fact, that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> control <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s marketable wealth. (In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> property really is theft,
pure and simple.) So in a sense all the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> needs to pay its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bills</ENAMEX> is for those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, plus a fringe of smaller-scale <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oligarchs</ENAMEX> who
would surely follow their lead, to pay the necessary taxes.

            But the
oligarchs own more than gas fields and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>. They also own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>. And
they decline to pay.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asimplified</ENAMEX> account of the crisis would then run as
follows. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> now, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> covered its deficits
through indirect foreign borrowing--that is, foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lenders</ENAMEX> have provided
money to "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>," which in turn have lent that money to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. The
willingness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> to provide this money was based on the belief that
eventually the oligarchs would be willing to pay their due, and if they did the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s huge natural resources would make it possible to honor its
commitments. However, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few months</TIMEX> this confidence has evaporated.
Foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lenders</ENAMEX> have been willing to provide money only at very high interest
rates (recently nearly triple world market rates)--and fears that the
government would try to inflate away its debt, or simply default on it, led to
interest rates on that (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ruble</NUMEX>-denominated) debt of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as high as 150 percent</NUMEX>. This
pessimism about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s solvency then became self-fulfilling. Given
the need to pay such high rates on its debt, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> needed to borrow
even more, further weakening confidence and pushing the rates still higher.

            The
devaluation of the ruble was a desperate attempt to buy a bit more time. By
reducing the dollar value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s debts, while hoping to raise the
ruble value of its receipts, it could narrow the financing gap. But instead the
devaluation convinced everyone that the game was up and that the ruble was
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> to become more or less worthless, and that was that.

            
The most striking thing about this story is how
self-destructive the behavior of the oligarchs seems to have been. It is very
much in their collective interest to have the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> survive, so that
they can continue to profit from their ill-gotten empires. Why couldn't they
get together and agree to pay enough taxes to keep their rackets going?

            One
answer is that there is no honor among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thieves</ENAMEX>--that the oligarchs are caught
in a classic "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>' dilemma," in which it is in the collective interest of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that everyone pay some taxes, but in the individual interest of each
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligarch</ENAMEX> to free-ride on the others. Indeed, far from being a cohesive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
the oligarchs have engaged in bitter business and political struggles (which,
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, are the same thing). It may be hard for them to cooperate, even when
it is a matter of saving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> that made them rich.

            Another answer, which may interact with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, is that
the oligarchs are not in this for the long run anyway--that at some level they
all expect the game to end fairly soon, and they are simply trying to grab as
much as they can. Certainly there has been massive flight of capital into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swiss</ENAMEX>
bank accounts and other hidden overseas assets. (Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> maintain
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subsidiaries</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cyprus</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nassau</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. They are presumably not there to
enjoy the weather or, for that matter, to do anything productive.) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, as
has been pointed out in this column before ("<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The East Is in the Red"</ENAMEX>),
has generally run huge trade surpluses. Think of those surpluses as the way an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligarch</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> gets converted into a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion</NUMEX> dollar nest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> someplace
outside the reach of the resurgent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lebed</ENAMEX>, or whoever
emerges from the wreckage.

            One thing that is clear is
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>, the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> who provided the funds for the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last</TIMEX>, doomed rescue package--have come out looking like chumps. There is a
possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defense</ENAMEX> for their actions: They may have believed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who
rule <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> were finally beginning to see the light, that in their own
self-interest they would agree to cough up the money the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> needed to
avoid disaster, but they needed a little time. In that case the big loans
organized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months ago</TIMEX> could have made the difference. But in fact the
money quickly disappeared, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX>--certainly including the oligarchs
themselves--converted <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">rubles</NUMEX> into dollars as fast as the dollars became
available. In effect we gave a lot of aid to some future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gstaad</ENAMEX>.

            Needless to say, in his
recent visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> repeated the old pieties, suggesting the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West</ENAMEX> was "ready to offer further assistance if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> stays with the path of
reforms." And he sounded sincere.
