            Company <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> "dominates" its
market, seeking to "crush" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">company Y. Meanwhile</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> A is locked in a "war"
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> B, declaring an intention to "take no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>." Mr. B, for his part,
says he "loves a good fight" and predicts "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Armageddon</ENAMEX>," since his upcoming
product release will "nuke 'em till they glow." The IPO of company Z is hot
because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> think it will "suck the life out" of established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>.
Any discussion of the technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> is colored with the lurid vocabulary
found mainly in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quentin Tarantino</ENAMEX> films. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Observers</ENAMEX> who knew business only from
these descriptions would reach <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conclusions: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) Business is an epic
and violent struggle, fought by heroic and powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) They are
overhearing a bunch of pre-teen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> playing with action figures. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>
option is a lot closer to the truth.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Titans of</ENAMEX>
industry as overpaid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ninja Turtles</ENAMEX>? Surely this isn't the case. Business is
war! Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> are strategic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders</ENAMEX>, who boldly snatch victory from the
jaws of defeat--and who perform other acts of derring-do. This kind of talk
sounds great in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boardroom</ENAMEX>, and, for that matter, in the bookstore, where
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors counsel</ENAMEX> would-be corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Tzu</ENAMEX> is alleged to
have written <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Art of War</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 2,500</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>--so he isn't personally
plying the seminar circuit, but his translators and interpreters are, along
with those promoting other military-history <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> of famers like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Attila the Hun</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Von Clausewitz</ENAMEX>, and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 th -century</TIMEX> samurai who wrote A
Book of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Five Rings</ENAMEX>.
            

            The first clue that something is amiss is that only dead
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX> seem to give business advice. Live <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> on the
specialized killing of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX>--efficient, but lacking the cachet of
ancient warfare. Where's the chivalry in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">stealth</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomber</ENAMEX>? Besides, modern
examples are obviously irrelevant to the next marketing plan. Dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>, on
the other hand, can opine on topics like swordsmanship, which are so irrelevant
that they can be mistaken for a mystical metaphor.

            When I
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> moved from theoretical physics to business, I dutifully read the
business-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as</NUMEX>-war books, hoping to gain some insights. I did learn a lot about
how the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> conducted foreign policy, the virtue of a few
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beheadings</ENAMEX> to discipline the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>, and how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Von Clausewitz</ENAMEX> thought you should
deploy field <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">artillery</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A decade</TIMEX> later I must confess that I've never deployed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">artillery</ENAMEX>, and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> has yet to come up. Nor have I had an
opportunity to behead miscreant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> (although in some cases, it is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pleasing</ENAMEX> thought). This is true even though I've served on the front lines of
the purported "battles" famed in the lore and legend of the software
industry.

            
Software-industry battles are fought by highly
paid and out-of-shape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nerds</ENAMEX> furiously pounding computer keyboards while they
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">guzzle diet Coke</ENAMEX>. The stakes aren't very dramatic. Life? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberty</ENAMEX>? The pursuit
of happiness? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nope</ENAMEX>, it's about stock options. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">winners</ENAMEX> will be worth
something; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">losers</ENAMEX> will negotiate new compensation deals with the next
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employer</ENAMEX>. A great deal of intellectual effort goes into this competition, but
violence or heroism? Not that I've seen. Late-night pizza <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> are about as
wild as it gets.

            The
bigger the technological "confrontation," the more slowly it occurs. Industry
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> have long predicted the death of the mainframe computer at the hands of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCs</ENAMEX> and workstations. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Twenty years</TIMEX> after this funeral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dirge</ENAMEX> started, it seems
safe to say the predictions were a bit premature. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 15 years</TIMEX>, the
personal computer had no direct competition with mainframes--they simply did
different things. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Utilities</ENAMEX> bills and payroll were not good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for a
PC, just as flying-toaster screen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savers</ENAMEX> were rare on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">IBM 3090s</ENAMEX>. More recently
a few mainframe applications have become feasible on PC servers, and it is
clear that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>, the last mainframe will be turned off. That day may be
another <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX> hence, or perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 10</NUMEX>. Either way, this clash of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">titans</ENAMEX> has been about as exciting to watch as a melting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glacier</ENAMEX>. Yet it is far
more typical of a technology change than the slam-bang predictions would
suggest.

            A new and fast-growing technology is, almost by definition,
expanding into a vacuum by operating in a new or unprecedented manner. It's
hard to take the world by storm and butt heads with entrenched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> at
the same time. Technological "revolutions" don't really overthrow
anything--they simply append a new and dynamic market to that which went
before. The new appendages might grow faster than their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX>, and so
eclipse them as the darling du jour of Wall Street. However, being upstaged
isn't quite the same as being annihilated, and it certainly isn't anything like
war. Less frequently, something is rendered totally obsolete--but usually only
if it has been around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Records</ENAMEX> were replaced by CDs, and lead type
died in favor of computerized fonts. However, each had a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100-year</TIMEX> ride of
popularity, so you can't feel too bad for them.

            Products
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> do go head-to-head in direct competition, but it is rare that the
challenger stages an upset during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the initial</TIMEX> period of high growth. The
fastest a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX> can win is in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> product versions--which is to
say, over a period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four to six years</TIMEX>. Hardly a blitzkrieg. When a winner
does emerge, the victory is rarely equivocal. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suicide</ENAMEX>, rather than death in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">battle</ENAMEX>, is the proximate cause of every high-tech demise I can think of.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Competitors</ENAMEX> bring pressure to bear on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, but the really damaging moves
are invariably self-inflicted. The immediate causes are many: A disastrous
acquisition drains cash reserves and defocuses management; a crucial technology
trend is ignored; attempts to diversify beyond the initial product line stall.
The most common problem is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> loses touch with the creativity and
technical wizardry that were once its raison <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">d'Ãªtre</ENAMEX>, often because of the exit
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founders</ENAMEX> and key technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. No <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX> or other external agent
can cause this sort of mortal damage; to find the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">culprit</ENAMEX>, senior management
needn't look further than a mirror.

            
This perspective might seem self-serving, since
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> use the word "domination" more often when referring to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> than
they do in calls to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">900</ENAMEX> numbers. It's rather amusing to conjure up this image
as I walk past <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> clad in chinos and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birkenstocks</ENAMEX>. Not exactly the garb
you'd envision for world domination. Perhaps my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insider</ENAMEX>'s view is biased, but
at least it's informed, unlike those of the many armchair <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> opining on
the matter. Be that as it may, bellicose language and self-inflicted wounds are
not exclusive to those parts of the industry where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> is involved--you
find them everywhere.

            The story
of the technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> gets spiced up because the reality is so bland.
Professional storytellers find this particularly vexing. The business press is
keen on salacious sound bites, because without such enhancement, nobody would
give a damn. "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Man Bites Dog</ENAMEX>" is a great headline. "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dog Bites Man</ENAMEX>" is a poor
substitute, but beats "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Man and Dog Work Really Hard Late at Night</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long</ENAMEX>
Time Until One of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Them Screws Up</ENAMEX>." The last has all the excitement of a game of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chess</ENAMEX> played via postcards--until it is recast as single-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX> combat.

            It's easy to mock the shallow treatment of complex
technology issues in the press, and the absurd opinions of self-proclaimed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>, and other touts. But the press only borrows the martial
rhetoric that business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> use themselves. It's not hard to see why they
use it. In a culture where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xena</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hercules</ENAMEX> have hit TV shows, it's a lot more
fun imagining that you are a valiant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX> doing business-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as</NUMEX>-battle than it
is to admit that you're a pudgy functionary whose most daring deed is to draft
a boldly worded memo. Just ask me.

            Tough talk and the rhetoric
of conflict help hide the basic truth that business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> are, in real life,
more contemplative than combative, more sedentary than savage. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leadership</ENAMEX> is
about being clever, hard-working, and drawing the best work from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>. Coming
to terms with this reality isn't easy, especially for the largely male
contingent of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> whose personal machismo is on the
line.

            Ever see a contemplative
Power <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ranger</ENAMEX>? Little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> face a problem very similar to that of high-tech
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>. They're steeped in a culture that honors power and conflict, yet
plainly don't yet have the physiques to match the myth. So, they compensate
with vocabulary, animating their play with exaggerated violence and tough talk,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">smashing</ENAMEX>, kicking, and zapping the imaginary bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX>. The good news is that
they are prime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for high-technology management--they only have to get
older, not more mature.
