            Let's talk about inflation
indexing and the meaning of life.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Early this month</TIMEX> a panel of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX>, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Boskin</ENAMEX>, made semiofficial what most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> have been saying for some time: The Consumer Price Index overstates
inflation. Nobody really knows by how much, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boskin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> made a
guesstimate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.1 percent</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>. Compounded over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, this is a huge
error.

            This
conclusion is controversial. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are upset because any reduction of
inflation estimates will reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> benefits, which are indexed to
the CPI. Others are upset because a revision of recent price history would mean
abandoning a worldview on which they have staked their reputations. Quite a few
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have committed themselves to the story line that productivity is up but
real wages are down. If inflation has been lower than was previously assumed,
that means the real value of wages may have gone up after all. And some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> with no particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ax</ENAMEX> to grind simply have doubts about the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">methodology</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boskin</ENAMEX> may be right or wrong, but one argument by his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> is clearly wrong. They say: Suppose it's true that inflation has been
less than the official increase in the CPI over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few decades</TIMEX>. If you
assume a lower inflation rate and recalculate real incomes back to--say,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>--you reach what seems to be a crazy conclusion: that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1950s</TIMEX>,
the era of postwar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">affluence</ENAMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> were living below what we now
regard as the poverty line. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boskin</ENAMEX> report regard this as a
decisive blow to its credibility.

            The idea
that most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> were poor in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX> is indeed absurd, but not because of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boskin</ENAMEX>'s numbers. After all, even if you use an unadjusted CPI, the standard of
living of the median family (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 th percentile</NUMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">America</ENAMEX>
appears startlingly low by current standards. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX>, median-family
income in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> dollars was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only about $18,000</NUMEX>. That's about the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">percentile</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Families</ENAMEX> at the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 th percentile</NUMEX>--that is, poorer
than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>--may not be legally poor (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 12</NUMEX>
percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are officially below the poverty line), but they are likely
to regard themselves as very disadvantaged and unsuccessful. So even using the
old numbers, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX> had a material standard of living no better
than that of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s poor or near-poor.

            
We can confirm this with more direct measures
of the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> lived. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX> some <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwellings</ENAMEX> lacked full
indoor plumbing. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> still did not have telephones or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>. And of
course very few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had televisions. A modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> at the
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12 th percentile</NUMEX> (that is, right at the poverty line) surely has a
flushing toilet, a working shower, and a telephone with direct-dial
long-distance service; probably has a color television; and may well even have
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. Take into account improvements in the quality of many other products,
and it does not seem at all absurd to say that the material standard of living
of that poverty-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> is as good as or better than that of the
median family in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>.

            What do
we mean by this? We mean that if you could choose between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> material
standards of living, other things being the same , you might well prefer
the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12 th</NUMEX> percentile standard of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">percentile</ENAMEX> standard of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>. But does that mean that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were poor in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>? No--because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> does not live by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, televisions, or even
plumbing alone.

            Imagine that a mad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> went back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX> and offered
to transport the median family to the wondrous world of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, and to place
them at, say, the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 th percentile</NUMEX> level. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>
percentile of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> is a clear material improvement over the median of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>.
Would they accept his offer? Almost surely not--because in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX> they were
middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>, while in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> they would be poor, even if they lived better in
material terms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> don't just care about their absolute material
level--they care about their level compared with others'.

            I know
quite a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX> who have nice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, and enviable working
conditions, yet are disappointed and bitter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>--because they have never
received an offer from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> and will probably not get a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Prize</ENAMEX>. They
live very well in material terms, but they judge themselves relative to their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reference</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and so they feel deprived. And on the other hand, it is an
open secret that the chief payoff from being really rich is, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Wolfe</ENAMEX> once
put it, the pleasure of "seeing 'em jump." Privilege is not merely a means to
other ends, it is an end in itself.

            
My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow Slate columnist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Wright</ENAMEX> would
undoubtedly emphasize that our concern over status exists for good evolutionary
reasons. In the ancestral environment a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> would be likely to have more
offspring if he got his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pick</ENAMEX> of the most fertile-seeming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. That, in turn,
would depend on his status, not his absolute standard of living. So <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> with
a predisposition to status-seeking left more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> than those without, and
the end result is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bill G-g-g</ENAMEX>---I mean, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Perelman</ENAMEX>.

            Is my license as a
practicing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> about to be revoked? Aren't we supposed to believe in
Economic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Man</ENAMEX>? And doesn't admitting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> care about fuzzy things like
status undermine the whole economic method? Not really: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo</ENAMEX> economicus
is not a central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pillar</ENAMEX> of my faith--he is merely a working assumption, albeit
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that is extremely useful in many circumstances.

            But
admitting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s happiness depends on their relative economic level as
well as their absolute economic resources has some subversive implications. For
example: Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> have seized on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boskin</ENAMEX> report as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> with
which to beat all those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> who have been whining about declining incomes
and increasing poverty in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>. It was all, they insist, a statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hoax</ENAMEX>.
But you could very well make the opposite argument. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> was a
middle-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">society</ENAMEX> in a way that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> is not. That is, it had
a much flatter income distribution, so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had much more sense of
sharing a common national lifestyle. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in that relatively equal
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> felt good about their lives, even though by modern standards, they were
poor--poorer, if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boskin</ENAMEX> is correct, than we previously thought. Doesn't this
mean, then, that having a more or less equal distribution of income makes for a
happier society, even if it does not raise anyone's material standard of
living ? That is, you can use the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> did not feel poor in the
1950s as an argument for a more radical egalitarianism than even most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leftists</ENAMEX>
would be willing to espouse.

            You could even argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> society in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> is
an engine that maximizes consumption yet minimizes satisfaction. In a society
with a very flat distribution of income and status, nobody feels left out. In a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX> with rigid ranks, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do not expect to rise above their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> and
therefore do not feel that they have failed if they do not rise. (Aristocrats
are not part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX>' reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern America</ENAMEX>, however, is a
hugely unequal society in which anyone can achieve awesome success, but not
many actually do. The result is that many--perhaps even most--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> feel that
they have failed to make the cut, no matter how comfortable their lives. (In a
land where anyone can become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, anyone who doesn't become
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> is a failure.) My <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> always marvel at how hard
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> work, even those who already have plenty of money. Why don't we take
more time to enjoy what we have? The answer, of course, is that we work so hard
because we are determined to get ahead--an effort that (for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX>) is doomed to failure, because competition for status is a zero-sum
game. We can't all "get ahead." No matter how fast we all run, someone must be
behind.

            If one follows this line of
thought one might well be led to some extremely radical ideas about economic
policy, ideas that are completely at odds with all current orthodoxies.
But I won't try to come to grips with such ideas in this column. Frankly, I
don't have the time. I have to get back to my research--otherwise, somebody
else might get that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX>.
