            Transactions involving
money--say, the purchase of something at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>--cost money. The cashier must
be paid, the cash register bought, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bookkeeper</ENAMEX> hired, etc. Honest mistakes
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dishonesty</ENAMEX> also take a toll. These expenses can be expressed as a cost per
transaction. The higher that cost, the larger the transaction has to be in
order for it to make financial sense.

            Computers
are very good at counting money and keeping records, so they have been used for
decades to manage transactions. Today, when your credit card is run through the
little machine at the checkout counter, computers handle the entire
transaction. Nobody is going to look at that little slip you sign unless a
problem develops.

            What is the cost of a transaction done purely by computer?
A recent estimate put the cost at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one</NUMEX>-millionth of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">one cent</NUMEX> per
transaction--i.e., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000,000</NUMEX> transactions can be done for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>
cash--where the value is stored on the card you carry and there's no need to
check your credit against a faraway database--may be even cheaper.

            Regardless
of how it's done, transaction costs will continue to plummet as computers get
more powerful. Low transaction costs are a wonderful thing if you're in the
transaction business. They're wonderful for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> too, making it cheaper
and easier to buy things and creating new things to buy. All this is especially
true now that the Internet provides a direct connection between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>.

            
In a normal situation, you could end there. But
this isn't a normal situation. This is the Internet, where any legitimate idea
is immediately taken to ridiculous limits. That's because there are plenty of
would-be Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visionaries</ENAMEX> competing to outdo each other, both in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">philosophizing</ENAMEX> and in trying to sell shares in their start-up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to the
public. The magic words "on the Internet," if inserted into nearly any
sentence, seem to protect it from normal critical scrutiny.

            So it is
with cheap transactions, which tend to go by the sexier name of "micropayment
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>." Press reports about micropayment schemes extol their virtues in
breathless wonder. Micropayments, it is said, will revolutionize the economics
of journalism on the Net (a topic I've opined on
before). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> will pay some small fee--like <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 cents</NUMEX>--to read an article,
rather than buy a whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.95</NUMEX>. Or, what the hell, they can pay by
the paragraph, sentence, word, or--why not push it to the extreme--the bit.
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

            No, actually, it wouldn't. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micropayments</ENAMEX> might be important
in some limited areas, but most of the hoopla is very poorly thought out. To
see why, consider <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>, which recently decided to remain free to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX>. But imagine that, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> hence, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> is trying to decide among
micropayments, subscriptions, and remaining free. Let's consider what effect
these choices will have on a couple of typical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> (or "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>," as they
used to be called--tellingly, the computer industry shares with the drug
industry the habit of referring to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> as "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>").

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Avid</ENAMEX>
is what we in the computer industry would call a "heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX> reads every
bit of every issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Accidental</ENAMEX> rarely reads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> on purpose--but
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every now and then</TIMEX>, he follows a link from another site into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>. Somewhere
in the middle is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Average</ENAMEX>, who reads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> just as much as the average user
does.

            
What price should we set for the micropayment?
If we set the price so that it will yield the same total revenue as a
subscription, then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> Average will pay the same amount either way. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accidental</ENAMEX> will save a bundle by buying occasional articles instead of having
to buy a subscription. But it's tough luck for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Avid</ENAMEX>. He--and everybody else
who reads more of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> than its average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>--will pay more than a normal
subscription would cost. In customer-service circles, this is known as
"screwing your best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX>." That's OK in the sex industry, but not so great
in others, because it tends to alienate the loyal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> who form the core
of the business. (It is, though, standard practice in the print-magazine
industry, which gives new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> a bargain rate and rewards steady renewal
by raising the price.)

            The
problem, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> and other Internet sites, comes from having to charge for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">usage</ENAMEX>, when what they're selling is intellectual property with a flat
production cost. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> doesn't get "used up" by being used. It costs virtually
the same amount to produce, no matter how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> use it, and no matter how
heavy the use.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Unabridged Dictionary</ENAMEX> is priced at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX>
and has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">315,000</NUMEX> entries. Of these, I have looked up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">maybe 20</NUMEX> of them since I
bought a copy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years ago</TIMEX>. If I could pay based on usage, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> would have to charge me <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5</NUMEX> for each word I looked up to bring in the same
revenue. Hardly a micropayment. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> bucks per look up would bankrupt frequent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scrabble</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> or copy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>, for example.

            But I
didn't really pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> to "use" <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> entries. It's much more accurate to say that
I paid for the option to use any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">315,000</NUMEX> entries that I might need.
Similarly, I subscribe to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> to get an option just in case I want to
read any of the articles. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>, for their part, arrange to have them all
written just in case I do.

            
You could argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Avid</ENAMEX> is so hooked on
Slate that we can afford to put him over a barrel at the micropayment rate,
even though it means that he will pay a lot more. Similarly, when dictionaries
are all online, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX> could hold up the world's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scrabble</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> and
copy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>. Unless, that is, there is competition that offers an exotic
billing option known as the subscription or flat-price deal. It won't take a
genius <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX> to come up with this plan. Charging a usage-based fee for
content sounds fair--but it is artificial, because your costs are fixed. A
flat-rate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX> would present an attractive proposition to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Avid</ENAMEX> and
anybody else with heavier-than-average usage.

            So what
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about</NUMEX> a hybrid plan--subscriptions for heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, and micropayments for the
rest? This is another way to say "drop prices," because heavier-than-average
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> will buy a subscription, while lighter-than-average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> will choose the
a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la carte</ENAMEX> plan. Dropping prices can sometimes make sense--especially when, as
here, you can drop them for only your least eager <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX> are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> in maximizing revenue and filling seats by charging different
amounts to different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.)

            But this raises another question. If lowering the price
gets you more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, why not lower it all the way to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> and get the
greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX>? That is, why not rely on advertising? Advertising is, in
effect, a funny kind of micropayment system. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Advertisers</ENAMEX> pay on the basis of
how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> see their ad. For most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, this is measured statistically,
via surveys, because statistical estimates are an even cheaper way to record
tiny transactions. They're not exact, but the overestimates and underestimates
average out over time. Besides, if the transactions are really small, who cares
if you miss a few? Ad rates amount to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few cents</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> impression,
which is in the same range as micropayments. And of course the customer ends up
paying, indirectly. But it feels different to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. If imposing micropayments
or other explicit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> fees loses you many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, you'll decide to stay free
and collect your micropayments through ads.

            
Micropayments are great if you use them for a product or service with certain
properties. It must be one where you can get away with usage-based pricing, and
where there is a strong rationale for making it cheap, yet not free. Put
another way--micropayments make sense only when they match the fundamental
economics of the product or service better than other ways of charging.
Products that get used up as they are used naturally have this property. If the
basic economics are usage-based, then the payment can be too. This class does
not include journalism or, indeed, most intellectual property. Yet, this is
where micropayments are most often suggested.

            
That isn't quite the end of the story. One
situation where micropayments will work is where there are no heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> or
repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>--or where you don't mind screwing your best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. Films
are a good example. The movie industry always starts a film with a high,
usage-based pricing model--<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7.50</NUMEX> or so per ticket. This price is high enough to
discourage many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from seeing the film. That doesn't matter, because after
a run in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, the film will be released to home-video rental and pay
per view, where it costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3 to $5</NUMEX> and nobody counts how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are in the
room. There it picks up a few repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, but mostly new ones. The price
is brought lower on premium cable (like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX>), which is a flat-rate cost to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>, and it eventually hits <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> when the movie appears on broadcast
television, where ads support it.

            
Technically speaking, this is a repeated auction. We're more familiar with what
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> call an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> auction--prices start low and rise as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> bid.
However, there is also the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> auction, where prices start high and go lower
until somebody bites. Movies are sold to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> via a very slow <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>
auction, where each phase between price drops can last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. Book
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> do the same thing, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stages--hardcover and paperback.

            Movies get away with this because they don't generally have
"heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>" or repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> see a film once, or at least
don't see it again for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many months</TIMEX>. Some films inspire hard-core <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fanatics</ENAMEX> who
see them repeatedly, but these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> are so few in number that movie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>
do not cut them a special deal. The real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savior</ENAMEX> is the repeated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> auction,
which lets <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> be cavalier about pricing the movie beyond the reach of a
large set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, because they'll get another crack at them later.

            Most Internet content does
not have these special properties. Sites need regular repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. Their
costs, for the most part, are not usage-based. So <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">micropayments</ENAMEX> will play a
very small role in selling Internet content. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> probably will wind up
being free, supported by ads. User fees will also exist, but for any content
conducive to repeat use, they will be based on a flat rate--either a
subscription to a site or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">membership</ENAMEX> that lets you get to a set of sites. A
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">penny</ENAMEX> won't buy much, even on the Web.
