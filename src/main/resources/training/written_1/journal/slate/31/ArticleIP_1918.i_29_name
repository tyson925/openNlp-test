            For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">garbage</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dump</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smokey Mountain</ENAMEX> was a favorite media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third</ENAMEX>
World poverty. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Several thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> lived on that
dump--enduring the stench, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX>, and the toxic waste in order to make a
living combing the garbage for scrap metal and other recyclables. And they
lived there voluntarily, because the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10</NUMEX> or so a squatter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> could clear in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> was better than the alternatives.

            The squatters are gone now,
forcibly removed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Philippine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">police</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> as a cosmetic move in advance
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Rim</ENAMEX> summit. But I found myself thinking about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smokey Mountain</ENAMEX>
recently, after reading my latest batch of hate mail.

            The occasion was an op-ed
piece I had written for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , in which I had pointed out
that while wages and working conditions in the new export industries of the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> World are appalling, they are a big improvement over the "previous, less
visible rural poverty." I guess I should have expected that this comment would
generate letters along the lines of, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Well</ENAMEX>, if you lose your comfortable
position as an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> you can always find another job--as long as
you are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 years old</TIMEX> and willing to work for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 cents</NUMEX> an hour."

            Such moral outrage is common
among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> of globalization--of the transfer of technology and capital
from high-wage to low-wage <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> and the resulting growth of
labor-intensive Third World exports. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> take it as a given that
anyone with a good word for this process is naive or corrupt and, in either
case, a de facto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> of global capital in its oppression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> here and
abroad.

            But
matters are not that simple, and the moral lines are not that clear. In fact,
let me make a counter-accusation: The lofty moral tone of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">globalization</ENAMEX> is possible only because they have chosen not to think their
position through. While fat-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">capitalists</ENAMEX> might benefit from globalization,
the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> are, yes, Third World <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>.

            After all, global poverty is not something recently
invented for the benefit of multinational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX>. Let's turn the clock
back to the Third World as it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only two decades ago</TIMEX> (and still is, in many
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX>, although the rapid economic growth of a handful of
small <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> had started to attract attention, developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> like
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangladesh</ENAMEX> were still mainly what they had always been: exporters
of raw materials, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">importers</ENAMEX> of manufactures. Inefficient manufacturing sectors
served their domestic markets, sheltered behind import quotas, but generated
few jobs. Meanwhile, population pressure pushed desperate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> into
cultivating ever more marginal land or seeking a livelihood in any way
possible--such as homesteading on a mountain of garbage.

            Given this
lack of other opportunities, you could hire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jakarta</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX> for a
pittance. But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-'70s</TIMEX>, cheap labor was not enough to allow a developing
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to compete in world markets for manufactured goods. The entrenched
advantages of advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>--their infrastructure and technical know-how,
the vastly larger size of their markets and their proximity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> of key
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>, their political stability and the subtle-but-crucial social
adaptations that are necessary to operate an efficient economy--seemed to
outweigh even a tenfold or twentyfold disparity in wage rates.

            
And then something changed. Some combination of
factors that we still don't fully
understand--lower tariff barriers, improved telecommunications, cheaper air
transport--reduced the disadvantages of producing in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
(Other things being the same, it is still better to produce in the First
World--stories of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that moved production to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Asia</ENAMEX>, then
moved back after experiencing the disadvantages of the Third World environment,
are common.) In a substantial number of industries, low wages allowed
developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> to break into world markets. And so <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> that had
previously made a living selling <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">jute</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> started producing shirts and
sneakers instead.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Workers</ENAMEX>
in those shirt and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sneaker factories</ENAMEX> are, inevitably, paid very little and
expected to endure terrible working conditions. I say "inevitably" because
their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> are not in business for their (or their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>') health; they
pay as little as possible, and that minimum is determined by the other
opportunities available to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. And these are still extremely poor
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, where living on a garbage heap is attractive compared with the
alternatives.

            And yet, wherever the new export industries have grown,
there has been measurable improvement in the lives of ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Partly
this is because a growing industry must offer a somewhat higher wage than
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> could get elsewhere in order to get them to move. More importantly,
however, the growth of manufacturing--and of the penumbra of other jobs that
the new export sector creates--has a ripple effect throughout the economy. The
pressure on the land becomes less intense, so rural wages rise; the pool of
unemployed urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwellers</ENAMEX> always anxious for work shrinks, so <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> start
to compete with each other for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, and urban wages also begin to rise.
Where the process has gone on long enough--say, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>--average wages start to approach what an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-ager</ENAMEX> can earn at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX>. And eventually <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are no longer eager to live on garbage dumps.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smokey Mountain</ENAMEX> persisted because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX>, until recently, did not
share in the export-led growth of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>. Jobs that pay better than
scavenging are still few and far between.)

            The
benefits of export-led economic growth to the mass of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the newly
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">industrializing</ENAMEX> economies are not a matter of conjecture. A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> like
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> is still so poor that progress can be measured in terms of how much
the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> gets to eat; since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>, per capita intake has risen from
less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,100</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2,800</NUMEX> calories a day. A shocking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of
young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are still malnourished--but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>, the fraction was more than
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>. Similar improvements can be seen throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Rim</ENAMEX>, and even in
places like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangladesh</ENAMEX>. These improvements have not taken place because
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">well-meaning people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> have done anything to help--foreign aid, never
large, has lately shrunk to virtually nothing. Nor is it the result of the
benign policies of national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, which are as callous and corrupt as
ever. It is the indirect and unintended result of the actions of soulless
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">multinationals</ENAMEX> and rapacious local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX>, whose only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> was to
take advantage of the profit opportunities offered by cheap labor. It is not an
edifying spectacle; but no matter how base the motives of those involved, the
result has been to move <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from abject poverty to
something still awful but nonetheless significantly better.

            
Why, then, the outrage of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondents</ENAMEX>?
Why does the image of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> sewing sneakers for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">60 cents</NUMEX> an hour evoke
so much more feeling than the image of another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> earning the
equivalent of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 cents</NUMEX> an hour trying to feed his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> on a tiny plot of
land--or of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> scavenging on a garbage heap?

            The main answer, I think, is
a sort of fastidiousness. Unlike the starving subsistence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sneaker factory</ENAMEX> are working at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX> wages for our
benefit --and this makes us feel unclean. And so there are self-righteous
demands for international labor standards: We should not, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> of
globalization insist, be willing to buy those sneakers and shirts unless the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who make them receive decent wages and work under decent conditions.

            This
sounds only fair--but is it? Let's think through the consequences.

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> of all, even if we could assure the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in Third
World export industries of higher wages and better working conditions, this
would do nothing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX>, day <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scavengers</ENAMEX>, and so on who make
up the bulk of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. At best, forcing developing
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> to adhere to our labor standards would create a privileged labor
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aristocracy</ENAMEX>, leaving the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> no better off.

            And it
might not even do that. The advantages of established First World industries
are still formidable. The only reason developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> have been able to
compete with those industries is their ability to offer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> cheap labor.
Deny them that ability, and you might well deny them the prospect of continuing
industrial growth, even reverse the growth that has been achieved. And since
export-oriented growth, for all its injustice, has been a huge boon for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>, anything that curtails that growth is very much
against their interests. A policy of good jobs in principle, but no jobs in
practice, might assuage our consciences, but it is no favor to its alleged
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX>.

            
You may say that the wretched of the earth
should not be forced to serve as hewers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>, drawers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sewers</ENAMEX>
of sneakers for the affluent. But what is the alternative? Should they be
helped with foreign aid? Maybe--although the historical record of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southern Italy</ENAMEX> suggests that such aid has a tendency to promote perpetual
dependence. Anyway, there isn't the slightest prospect of significant aid
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">materializing</ENAMEX>. Should their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> provide more social justice? Of
course--but they won't, or at least not because we tell them to. And as long as
you have no realistic alternative to industrialization based on low wages, to
oppose it means that you are willing to deny desperately poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> the best
chance they have of progress for the sake of what amounts to an aesthetic
standard--that is, the fact that you don't like the idea of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> being paid
a pittance to supply rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Westerners</ENAMEX> with fashion items.

            In short, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondents</ENAMEX>
are not entitled to their self-righteousness. They have not thought the matter
through. And when the hopes of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of millions</NUMEX> are at stake, thinking
things through is not just good intellectual practice. It is a moral duty.
