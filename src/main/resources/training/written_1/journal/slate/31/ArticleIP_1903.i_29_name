            If you can clone a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>,
you can almost certainly clone a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human being</ENAMEX>. Some of the most powerful people
in the world have felt compelled to act against this threat. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
swiftly imposed a ban on federal funding for human-cloning research. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bills</ENAMEX> are
in the works in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to outlaw human cloning--a step urged
on all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX> himself. Cloning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> is taken to be either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
a fundamentally evil thing that must be stopped or, at the very least, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) a
complex ethical issue that needs legislation and regulation. But what, exactly,
is so bad about it?

            Start by
asking whether human beings have a right to reproduce. I say "yes." I have no
moral right to tell other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> they shouldn't be able to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and I
don't see that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> has that right either. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> says, "Let us
resist the temptation to copy ourselves," it comes from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> not known for
resisting other temptations of the flesh. And for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX>, making noise
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> cloning is pretty close to a fleshly temptation itself. It's an easy way
to show sound-bite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> on an issue that everybody is talking about,
without much risk of bitter consequences. After all, how much federally funded
research was stopped by this ban? Probably almost none, because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">maintained Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX>'s policy of minimizing federal grants for research in
human reproduction. Besides, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> thought cloning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> was
impossible--so, for the moment, there's unlikely to be a grant-request backlog.
There is nothing like banning the nonexistent to show true <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX>, unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, is known for resisting
temptation. He also openly claims the authority to decide how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> reproduce.
I respect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX>'s freedom to lead his religion, and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX>' freedom
to follow his dictate. But calling for secular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> to implement a ban,
thus extending his power beyond those he can persuade, shows rather explicitly
that the pope does not respect the freedom of others. The basic
religious doctrine he follows was set down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some two</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">millennia ago</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Sheep</ENAMEX>
feature prominently in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>, but cloning does not. So the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX>'s views on
cloning are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">st century</TIMEX> rules applied using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th century</ENAMEX>
religious thinking to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 st century</TIMEX> issue.

            If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> have a right to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reproduce</ENAMEX>, what right does society have to limit the means? Essentially all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproduction</ENAMEX> is done <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> with medical help--at delivery, and often
before. Truly natural human reproduction would mean <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> infant mortality
and make pregnancy-related death the No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killer</ENAMEX> of adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.

            True, some
forms of medical help are more invasive than others. With in vitro
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fertilization</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> are combined in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> and surgically
implanted in the womb. Less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades ago</TIMEX>, a similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> was raised
over the ethical issues involved in "test-tube <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>." To date, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 30,000</NUMEX>
such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> have been born in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> alone. Many would-be parents
have been made happy. Who has been harmed?

            
The cloning procedure is similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVF</ENAMEX>. The
only difference is that the DNA of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> would be replaced by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from
an adult cell. What law or principle--secular, humanist, or religious--says
that one combination of genetic material in a flask is OK, but another is not?
No matter how closely you study the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 st century</TIMEX> texts, I don't think
you'll find the answer.

            Even if
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have the right to do it, is cloning a good idea? Suppose that every
prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> in the world stopped having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> naturally, and instead
produced clones of themselves. What would the world be like in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another 20 or 30</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>? The answer is: much like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cloning</ENAMEX> would only copy the genetic
aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are already here. Hating a world of clones is hating the
current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populace</ENAMEX>. Never before was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pogo</ENAMEX> so right: We have met the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>, and he
is us !

            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Adifferent</ENAMEX> scare scenario is a world filled with copies of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">famous people</ENAMEX> only. We'll treat celebrity DNA like designer clothes, hankering
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jordan</ENAMEX>'s genes the way we covet his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nike</ENAMEX> sneakers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. But even
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity infatuation</ENAMEX> has its limits. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are not more taken with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> than they are with themselves. Besides, such a trend would correct
itself in a generation or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX> is closely linked to rarity.
The world seems amused by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Stern</ENAMEX>, but give us <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</NUMEX>
of them, and they'll seem a lot less endearing.

            Clones already exist. About
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> births results in a pair of babies with the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. We
know them as identical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>. Scientific studies on such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>--reared together
or apart--show that they share many characteristics. Just how many they share
is a contentious topic in human biology. But genetic determinism is largely
irrelevant to the cloning issue. Despite how many or how few individual
characteristics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>--or other clones--have in common, they are different
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the most fundamental sense . They have their own identities, their
own thoughts, and their own rights. Should you be confused on this point, just
ask a twin.

            Suppose that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Unsolved</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mysteries</ENAMEX> called you with news of a long-lost identical twin. Would that
suddenly make you less of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, less of an individual? It is hard to see
how. So, why would a clone be different? Your clone would be raised in a
different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX> by different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>--like the lost identical twin, only younger
than you. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s basic humanity is not governed by how he or she came into
this world, or whether somebody else happens to have the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twins</ENAMEX>
aren't the only clones in everyday life. Think about seedless <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX> or navel
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX>--if there are no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>, where did they come from? It's the plant
equivalent of virgin birth--which is to say that they are all clones,
propagated by cutting a shoot and planting it. Wine is almost entirely a cloned
product. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX> used for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>, but they've been cloned from
shoots for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a hundred years</TIMEX> in the case of many <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX>. The same is
true for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. Go to a garden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>, and you'll find products with
delightful names like "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Olivia's Cloning Compound</ENAMEX>," a mix of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> to dunk on
the cut end of a shoot to help it take root.

            
One recurring image in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-cloning</ENAMEX> propaganda
is of some evil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> raising an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cloned warriors</ENAMEX>. Excuse me, but who
is going to raise such an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> ("raise" in the sense used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>)? Clones
start out life as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Armies</ENAMEX> are far easier to raise the old
fashioned way--by recruiting or drafting naive young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dulce et</ENAMEX>
decorum est pro patria mori has worked well enough to send countless young
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to their deaths through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ages</TIMEX>. Why mess with success?

            Remember
that cloning is not the same as genetic engineering. We don't get to make
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superman</ENAMEX>--we have to find him first. Maybe we could clone the superwarrior from
Congressional Medal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Honor winners</ENAMEX>. Their bravery might--or might not--be
genetically determined. But, suppose that it is. You might end up with such a
brave battalion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> that when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">grenade</ENAMEX> lands in their midst, there is a
competition to see who gets to jump on it to save the others. Admirable
perhaps, but not necessarily the way to win a war. And what about the supply
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sergeants</ENAMEX>? The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> has a lot more of them than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX>. You could try to breed
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> for every job, including the petty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX>, but what's the point?
There's not exactly a shortage of them.

            What if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> clones were to rule <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> for another
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thousand years</TIMEX>? Sounds bad, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX>'s natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uday</ENAMEX> is reputed to make
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> seem saintly by comparison. We have no more to fear from a clone of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX>, or of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX>, than we do from their natural-born kin--which is to say,
we don't have much to fear: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dictators</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> rarely pose a problem. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> retired to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim Jong Il</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> is laughable as
Great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leader</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Version 2.0</ENAMEX>.

            The notion
of an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> cloning himself to cheat death is quaint, but it is
unrealistic. First, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> wouldn't really be him. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, is the old duffer
really up to changing diapers? A persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">octogenarian</ENAMEX> might convince a
younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> to have his clone and raise it, but that is not much different
from fathering a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> via a surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>.

            
Fear of clones is just another form of racism.
We all agree it is wrong to discriminate against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> based on a set of
genetic characteristics known as "<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">race</ENAMEX>." Calls for a ban on cloning amount to
discrimination against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> based on another genetic trait--the fact that
somebody already has an identical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequence</ENAMEX>. The most extreme form of
discrimination is genocide--seeking to eliminate that which is different. In
this case, the genocide is pre-emptive--clones are so scary that we must
eliminate them before they exist with a ban on their creation.

            What is
so special about natural reproduction anyway? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cloning</ENAMEX> is the only predictable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to reproduce, because it creates the identical twin of a known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX>.
Sexual reproduction is a crap shoot by comparison--some random mix of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX>. In evolutionary theory, this combination is thought to help stir the gene
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX>, so to speak. However, evolution for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> is essentially over, because
we use medical science to control the death rate.

            Whatever the temptations of cloning, the process of natural
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproduction</ENAMEX> will always remain a lot more fun. An expensive and
uncomfortable lab procedure will never offer any real competition for sex. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> most likely to clone will be those in special circumstances--infertile
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> who must endure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVF</ENAMEX> anyway, for example. Even there, many will mix
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetics</ENAMEX> to mimic nature. Another special case is where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a couple
has a severe genetic disease. They might choose a clone of the healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>,
rather than burden their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> with a joint heritage that could be fatal.

            The most
upsetting possibility in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cloning</ENAMEX> isn't superwarriors or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictators</ENAMEX>. It's
that rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with big egos will clone themselves. The common practice of
giving a boy the same name as his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> or choosing a family name for a child
of either sex reflects our hunger for vicarious immortality. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clones</ENAMEX> may
resonate with this instinct and cause some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to reproduce this way. So
what? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rich</ENAMEX> and egotistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> do all sorts of annoying things, and the law is
hardly the means with which to try and stop them.

            
The "deep ethical issues" about cloning mainly
boil down to jealousy. Economic jealousy is bad enough, and it is a factor
here, but the thing that truly drives <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> crazy is sexual jealousy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eons</ENAMEX> of
evolution through sexual selection have made the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> insanely
jealous of any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interloper</ENAMEX> who gains a reproductive advantage--say by diddling
your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cloning</ENAMEX> is less personal than cuckoldry, but it strikes a similar
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chord</ENAMEX>: Someone has got the reproductive edge on you.

            Once the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fuss</ENAMEX> has died down and further animal research has paved the way, direct human
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cloning</ENAMEX> will be one more option among many specialized medical interventions in
human reproduction, affecting only a tiny fraction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Research
into this area could bring far wider benefits. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s knee-jerk policy
changes nothing in the short run, but it is ultimately a giant step backward.
In using an adult cell to create a clone, the "cellular clock" that determines
the difference between an embryo and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> was somehow reset. Work in this area
might help elucidate the process by which aging occurs and yield a way to reset
the clocks in some of our own cells, allowing us to regenerate. Selfishly
speaking, that would be more exciting to me than cloning, because it would help
me . That's a lot more directly useful than letting me sire an identical
twin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years</TIMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junior</ENAMEX>.

            To some, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> laboring away to unlock the
mysteries of life is a source of evil, never to be trusted. To others,
including me, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> is the ray of light, illuminating the processes
that make the universe work and making us better through that knowledge.
Various arguments can be advanced toward either view, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> key statistic is
squarely on my side. The vast majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, including those who rail
against science, owe their very lives to previous medical discoveries. They
embody the fruits of science. Don't let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of darkness, ignorance, and
fear turn us back from research. Instead, let us raise--and yes, even
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clone</ENAMEX>--new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of hapless ingrates, who can whine and rail against the
discoveries of the next age.
