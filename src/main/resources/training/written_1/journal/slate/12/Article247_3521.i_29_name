            I have no idea whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ty Inc.</ENAMEX>'s promise that as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 31</TIMEX> it will make no
more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Beanie Babies</ENAMEX> is true. If it isn't, it's a great way to spur short-term
sales, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> the flagging <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Beanie Baby</ENAMEX> market will be enlivened by the
desire to get in while you can. (Along the same lines, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine thinks
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> should keep labeling each issue "the last issue of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> " for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as many months</TIMEX> as it can.)

            But short-term sales aside, if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ty</ENAMEX>'s promise isn't true, it should be, since
it represents a very rare thing in the business world: a recognition that
things actually come to an end. (A similarly smart decision was made, oddly
enough, by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founders</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilith Fair</ENAMEX> tour <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>.) Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX>
an unusual combination of oversaturation and fatigue with high prices has
weighed down the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Beanie Baby</ENAMEX> market (and no, I can't believe I'm actually
writing this sentence). More to the point, like any fad it's fading out,
displaced by the latest objects of fascination for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ty</ENAMEX> is rapidly
reaching the point of diminishing returns. Cashing out now would be an
excellent move.

            What makes such a move difficult is that although <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Beanie Babies</ENAMEX> may have
reached the point of diminishing returns, they probably have not reached the
point of nonexistent returns. In other words, there's still money to be made
selling <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Beanie Babies</ENAMEX>. It's just not enough money to justify future investment.
And the fundamental problem is that if you don't move on early enough, you find
yourself caught, believing that the only way to recoup the money you've put
into the business is to keep going in it.

            Excellent examples of what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ty</ENAMEX> doesn't want to become abound, especially
within the odd industry of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectible</ENAMEX> pop culture. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1980s</TIMEX> and early
1990s, baseball cards exploded into a classic speculative bubble--there I go,
sounding like the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX>--to which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> responded by producing
too many cards that were too expensive. When the bubble burst, entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companies</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vanished</ENAMEX>, and the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">players</ENAMEX> have barely struggled to stay afloat. The same
was true of comic books, which saw a proliferation of titles and of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>
when they were hot and a dramatic downsizing when demand faded. Unfortunately,
when the smoke clears, prices for these goods remain surprisingly high (an
average comic book is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> times more expensive than it was 20 years
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>), which may have something to do with why sales growth is so slow.

            All of this is almost textbook economics, of course, since any time you have
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> that is reaping sizeable profits, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> are going to enter the
market and successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> are going to expand rapidly in an attempt to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sell</ENAMEX> more goods. But in textbook economics, any competitive marketplace ends
with everyone reaping no profits. That's why the discipline to move on when the
market becomes oversaturated--or, alternatively, when the market simply dries
up--is a necessary discipline. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ty</ENAMEX> announcement is real, then that's one
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> at least that's acquired that rigor.
