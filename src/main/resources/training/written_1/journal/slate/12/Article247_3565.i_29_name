            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> each lead with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX>'s acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$36 billion</NUMEX>
transaction, resulting, if approved by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> and the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>,
in a huge new multimedia <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> top-fronts the deal, but leads instead with
a story breaking in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> press that none of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> big
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dailies</ENAMEX> has: A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> investigation's fresh evidence that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> receiving
major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kremlin</ENAMEX> contracts paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens of thousands of dollars</NUMEX> in bills on credit
cards belonging to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Yeltsin</ENAMEX> and his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 million</NUMEX> to a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> bank account associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX>.

            For those scoring at home, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom/CBS</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> deal ever, with the
new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> becoming the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media enterprise</ENAMEX>, while both the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> say it's the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> deal ever resulting in the
No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfit</ENAMEX>, behind only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>. The papers explain that the deal
exemplifies the virtues of vertical integration, nicely defined by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> as "the ability to produce entertainment and simultaneously
distribute it." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> notes that this feature of the deal, tying up as
it does many production and distribution <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, could stimulate other
similar mergers among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> now needing more than ever to tie up their
own.

            The coverage notes the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> largest speed bumps for the get-together: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX>
owns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPN</ENAMEX>, and current federal rules prevent a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> from owning two
broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. Also, there is a rule limiting a media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s TV reach
to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 percent</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>, and the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> will reach <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41 percent</NUMEX>. The
papers note that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sumner Redstone</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX>'s No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mel Karmazin</ENAMEX>, will be visiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> to appeal for
special dispensation on these matters.

            The deal coverage is shot through with the usual attempts at dramatizing the
essentially undramatic activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> in suits writing themselves checks. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> , for instance, bathetically refers to "a series of secret meetings
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karmazin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">penthouse apartment</ENAMEX>," during which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redstone</ENAMEX> "grew to see the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">magic</ENAMEX> of the marriage <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karmazin</ENAMEX> was proposing." Perhaps <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>'s definitive
merger porn is this line from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redstone</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karmazin</ENAMEX>, quoted in one of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> (!) inside stories about the deal: "This began as a deal
involving some television stations. Then he started talking about cable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. Then I could see it coming. He is a master <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX>, and he began to
turn me on." Just about the only relief from all this breathlessness comes from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> , which quotes an academic as saying, "It seems to me that this
is, by any definition, an undemocratic development. The media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> in a
democracy should not be inordinately dominated by a few very powerful
interests."

            Everybody reports that just ahead of a looming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> deadline, a group of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationalists</ENAMEX> has accepted the politically explosive clemency
recently offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. This means they will have to foreswear
violence or its advocacy. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> offered the deal declined it.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> run stories reporting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>,
State, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> learned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last spring</TIMEX> of massive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
money-laundering involving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of New York</ENAMEX> but didn't pass the information
along to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> buries this information
near the bottom of its lead.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> front reports that on the eve
of former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Cisneros</ENAMEX>' trial on various charges stemming from
his payment of hush money to a paramour, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cisneros</ENAMEX> pleaded guilty to a single
count of lying to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> when asked about the cash, netting a fine but no
jail. The case had been developed by an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> under the
now-lapsed statute. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> headlines emphasize the
incommensurability of the case's cost (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$9 million</NUMEX>) and its result.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> ran a sprawling front-page "special report" raising the question of whether the now-confirmed
ability in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> to miniaturize nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> was a result of
spying on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> or just hard, independent work. The effort,
conducted by one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>'s most able science <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William J. Broad</ENAMEX>,
says high up that the congressional report issued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late last year</TIMEX> asserting that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">espionage</ENAMEX> was the main explanation "went beyond the evidence," and that his
thorough review shows that perhaps "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX>" of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> had access to the
information that the report and the federal investigation suggest came from one
dismissed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wen Ho Lee</ENAMEX>. Now, given that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> ran hard and
often with the congressional report and the line it took, does this piece
represent some sort of about-face? Or worse, some sort of illegitimate attempt
by the paper to revise its history of coverage on the subject? <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Papers</ENAMEX>
doesn't think so. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>'s coverage has generally been clear in attributing
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wen Ho Lee</ENAMEX>-probably-did-it line to particular (named and unnamed)
government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. And anyway, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> should be encouraged to revisit a topic
as more information becomes available and better understood. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Papers</ENAMEX>'
only complaint about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broad</ENAMEX>'s re-look is that it somewhat unfairly chips away at
the impression the paper had originally created: The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-page piece waits
until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the second-to-last</TIMEX> column to state that the consensus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> is that espionage played a role in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>'s catch-up even
if there is no smoking-gun evidence for this.
