            Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> suspect that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mobsters</ENAMEX> may have
used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of New York</ENAMEX> to launder <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $10 billion</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last two</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. What exactly is money laundering and how does it work?

            In short, money laundering is the conversion of illegally obtained profits
into funds that appear legitimate--that is, making "dirty" money "clean." It is
used by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traffickers</ENAMEX>, arms smugglers, and anyone else who needs to spend
ill-gotten gains without arousing suspicion. White collar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> and corrupt
political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> also frequently launder funds to avoid taxes or conceal
embezzlement.

            The simplest form of money laundering is combining criminal profits with
earnings from a legitimate, cash-intensive business. For example, say a drug
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> wants to disguise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> profits from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> sales. So, he
buys a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> that takes in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50,000</NUMEX> a month--mostly in cash. At the end of each
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX>, he slips <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an extra $10,000</NUMEX> into his till and reports <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$60,000</NUMEX> in bar
revenue. Although his drug income is now taxable, it is worth that price to
make the profits appear legal.

            Larger amounts, like <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 billion</NUMEX>, can't just be slipped into the till.
Laundering big sums generally involves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> steps:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Placement</ENAMEX> : The cash proceeds (often <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of small-denomination
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bills</ENAMEX>) enter the legitimate banking system. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> require that large
cash transactions (in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, anything above <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10,000</NUMEX>) be reported to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>. So, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">launderers</ENAMEX> often deposit proceeds piece by piece or export the
money to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> with relaxed banking regulations.

            
               Layering : The money is separated from its criminal origins through
complex financial transactions. Often, funds will be transferred <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of
times through multiple accounts, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, making the paper
trail virtually impossible to follow.

            
               Integration : The money returns to its original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, apparently as
legitimate income.

            There are countless variations on this pattern. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most common is
the "loan-back" scheme, in which the launderer essentially borrows money from
himself. First, he sets up a lending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> with few financial
regulations. Then he fills its coffers with illegal profits, layered through
multiple accounts. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">launderer</ENAMEX> wants to make a purchase in his home
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, he simply "borrows" the money from the overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lender</ENAMEX>. This money,
once illegal, now appears to be a legitimate loan.
