            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times lead with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Timor</ENAMEX>, where the region's just-announced vote to
secede from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> is being met with a murderous spree by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX>independence
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The violence is also the top non-local item at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> .

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX>independence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, labeled "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangs</ENAMEX>" high up by the two
Times (although the word is never used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> ), had by late
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> set fire to numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in the territorial capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dili</ENAMEX> and
shot "scores" of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Timorese</ENAMEX> there and elsewhere on the island. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> say that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dili</ENAMEX> have taken shelter and the former
also reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> is making plans to receive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX>.
The coverage makes it clear that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is at best only
giving lip service to stopping the violence. The striking picture on the
LAT front seems to speak to this: It shows an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX> trying
to stop the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographer</ENAMEX> from taking a shot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> preparing to board a
plane. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> both note that several top <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX>
government and military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> flew to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dili</ENAMEX> and made promises to restore
order but did not venture beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> says there are
increasing indications that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> have joined in the violence,
noting that apparently many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> had been shot by military assault <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX>
and citing a report that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">convoy</ENAMEX> was fired on by paramilitary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>. And
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> quotes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dili</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> saying he would not shoot
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">militia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> if they attacked and that what they are doing is good for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> notes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>'s vote about possible civil
strife afterward, but says that "what is happening is not civil war but simply
the killing and intimidation of unarmed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> goes on to
characterize international reaction thus far as "public condemnations and much
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hand-wringing</ENAMEX>," and also notes a problem with a proposed interposition of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> peacekeeping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">force</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, which can veto such a move, is believed to be
opposed to it.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> run front-page reports of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> car bombs
exploding in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 miles</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> apart. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> runs the
story inside. The explosions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> note, came on the heels of a promising
preliminary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli-Palestinian</ENAMEX> land-for-security deal and threaten moving
further towards peace.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> fronts, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> stuff, word that a
powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car bomb</ENAMEX> demolished an apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dagestan</ENAMEX> housing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">counterinsurgency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Prior to the explosion, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>
had, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> , all but declared victory against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX>
there, but this development appears to mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dagestan</ENAMEX> will continue to be a
political and military problem for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> fronts the very negative reactions of several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX>'s call for her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> to rescind his clemency
offer to convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>. According to the paper, the most
outspoken was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Serrano</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrat</ENAMEX>, who said that as a result he was
withdrawing his support for her likely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> bid. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> adds inside
that on the chat shows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pols</ENAMEX> charged that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX>'s stance was an attempt to back off a political favor by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> that was backfiring.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis Colts</ENAMEX> have become the first team
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX> to start its own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> is quoted saying that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> is
concerned about a range of matters before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, including an antitrust bill
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' compensation laws and tax issues. (Maybe they should concentrate a
little bit more on, oh, scoring.)

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Kurtz</ENAMEX> gives some details about the recent departure
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Elena Fernandez</ENAMEX> (now with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> ). Quoting an account <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernandez</ENAMEX> wrote for a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurtz</ENAMEX> says she quit in part because an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> told her some of her wardrobe was
too revealing and was creating a stir in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> runs a front-page feature by sports long-form legend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Lipsyte</ENAMEX> on the first major league <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> to come
out extensively to the press (in a previous article in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herald</ENAMEX> ), a retired utility <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">player</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy Bean</ENAMEX> who played with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tigers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodgers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Padres</ENAMEX>. What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bean</ENAMEX> was up against in the aggressively hetero
world of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MLB</ENAMEX> is well expressed in his line, "I went to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hooters</ENAMEX>, laughed at the
jokes, lied about dates because I loved <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>."

            Is there a better racket than travel journalism? At least if you write a
travel book you actually have to come up with a couple of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> pages' worth
of information. But even for a couple of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</NUMEX> words that could have come
from a brochure, the airfare still gets picked up by somebody else. Witness
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> piece on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kauai</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureau</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Todd</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. Purdum</ENAMEX>, who tore himself away for a week in order to break the bulletin that
"the exoticism of the island <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> is palpable and omnipresent." Who knew?
