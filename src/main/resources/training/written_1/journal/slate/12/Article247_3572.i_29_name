            Chatterbox was a bit surprised to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Faludi</ENAMEX>'s forthcoming book,
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man</ENAMEX> , get the
red-carpet treatment from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> put <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faludi</ENAMEX> on this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>'s cover, and inside ran a lengthy excerpt with no <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than four</NUMEX> sidebars (to read them, click
here and here and here and here) and, to top it all off, an extremely sympathetic interview with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>. Perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> wouldn't have been
so surprised had he known that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faludi</ENAMEX> recently became a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX>
contributing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>. But that's surprising, too.

            Why? Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faludi</ENAMEX>'s hugely successful previous book, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Backlash</ENAMEX> , was in large part an attack on, well,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> . Backlash is remembered as a broadside against 1980s
culture as a whole, and (to quote its subtitle) its "undeclared war against
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>." That culture is represented in Backlash mainly through
the news media, which (if you read the book quickly) comes off as uniformly
hostile toward feminism. But if you take a closer look, you'll notice that some
news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> come off worse than others. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faludi</ENAMEX> doesn't make a big deal of
this, presumably because she never really intended Backlash to be a
critique of particular news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> so much as, well, a broadside against
the culture as a whole. (That the culture as a whole quickly turned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faludi</ENAMEX>'s
book into a runaway best-seller has always suggested to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Backlash</ENAMEX>'s thesis was an oversimplification.)

            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faludi</ENAMEX>'s acknowledgements, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Backlash</ENAMEX> began as a story for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Jose Mercury News</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> debunking an unpublished
academic study by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Bloom</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patricia Craig</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX>
graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>, purporting to show that never-married college-educated women
faced, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 30</TIMEX>, only a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> chance of getting hitched in their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifetimes</ENAMEX>. The findings became famous when they landed on the cover of â€¦
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> . Much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Backlash</ENAMEX> is dedicated to demolishing both the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloom-Craig</ENAMEX> research itself and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX>'s further distortion of it-most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">famously</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX>'s preposterous claim that a single gal was more
likely to be killed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist</ENAMEX> than to find a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faludi</ENAMEX> writes that

            

               
                  [a] former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> bureau <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intern</ENAMEX> who was involved in the story's
preparation later explains how the terrorist analogy wound up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>:
"What happened is, one of the bureau <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> was going around saying it as a
joke--like, 'Yeah, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s more likely to get bumped off by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist</ENAMEX>'-and
next thing we knew, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> took it seriously and it
ended up in print."
               

            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> also gets cuffed about in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Backlash</ENAMEX> for decrying "the
emotional fallout of feminism"; for hyping "cocooning," a trend pretty much
invented by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faith Popcorn</ENAMEX>; for attacking the "myth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supermom</ENAMEX>"; for running
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> covers on the "trend of childlessness"; and for exaggerating the problem of
drug addiction among pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>, among other sins. In many instances,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faludi</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">digs</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> are actually somewhat unfair. (The conflict
between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s traditional motherhood role and their increased participation
in the workplace isn't just something dreamed up by newsmagazine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>.) But
that isn't the point. The point is that an implicit theme running throughout
Backlash is that in a world plagued by stupid, superficial journalism,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> is stupider and more superficial than most print <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>. That
doesn't make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faludi</ENAMEX> a hypocrite for becoming a contributing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> . Even if she thinks the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> is no better now than it was
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>, she probably figures she'll help it improve. But look at this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faludimania</ENAMEX> cover package from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX>'s point of view: They're
heaping laurels onto someone who's called them a bunch of sexist ninnies! Is
this an admirable show of open-mindedness, a pathetic demonstration of low
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">self-esteem</ENAMEX>, or inevitable mindless worship of whatever is "hot"? Perhaps a bit
of each.
