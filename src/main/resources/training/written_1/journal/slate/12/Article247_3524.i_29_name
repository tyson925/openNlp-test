            After years of denial, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> has admitted to using pyrotechnic (or
"incendiary") tear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> assault on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Branch</ENAMEX> Davidian
compound in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>. What is pyrotechnic tear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and why is it
controversial?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tear gas</ENAMEX> is a basic tool of law enforcement. It causes extreme, disabling,
but usually temporary discomfort, and therefore is considered a humane
alternative to using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> common ways to disperse tear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>.
Aerosol hoses work like an insecticide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray</ENAMEX>. They cause the least
amount of physical damage, but can only be used up close. Powder
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grenades</ENAMEX> can be thrown from a distance and send up a mist of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">powder</ENAMEX>.
Pyrotechnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">devices</ENAMEX> also launch tear gas from afar, in combination with
a heat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. The result is an explosion, releasing a cloud of tear gas
particles mixed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">smoke</ENAMEX>. Pyrotechnic tear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> has tactical advantages.
First, the smoke cloud obscures the movement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> as they approach a
building or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, because the metal casing becomes quite hot, it is
difficult for the device to be thrown back at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> (a common problem with
powder <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">grenades</ENAMEX>). The disadvantage is that it can start a fire. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>
insists, however, that the timing and location make it impossible to blame
pyrotechnic tear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> for the fire that killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waco</ENAMEX>.

            A former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dallas Morning News</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
Army's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Force</ENAMEX> were present at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waco</ENAMEX> standoff. Military documents
confirmed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commandos</ENAMEX> observed the siege on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Branch</ENAMEX> Davidian
compound. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> stated that it could not discuss any aspect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force</ENAMEX>--including whether it exists. What is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Force</ENAMEX>?

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Force</ENAMEX> is a counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX> by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> following some particularly bloody attacks on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
abroad. The thinking was that a small, secret, specially trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cadre</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> would be able to respond more effectively to terrorist threats,
particularly those involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostages</ENAMEX>. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> did not stay secret for
long. In their best-known operation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> assisted in the failed
attempt to free <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostages</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Force</ENAMEX>, one of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX>'s Special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operations</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, is based in a remote part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ft. Bragg</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.C.</ENAMEX>, and is estimated to be as large as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commandos</ENAMEX> are
known to have participated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military action in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grenada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX>.

            Use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Force</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waco</ENAMEX> is controversial because of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1878</TIMEX> Posse
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Comitatus Act</ENAMEX>, which makes it illegal to use federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> to enforce laws
within <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S. territory</ENAMEX>, except when a presidential waiver is granted. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>,
this resulted in a strict division between the military and civilian law
enforcement. But the restrictions were amended in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> to allow military
involvement in the drug war. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> may train law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and
lend them equipment for use in drug raids. But military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> are still
forbidden to be directly involved in searches, seizures, and arrests--even
those related to drug crimes.

            Because rumors of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Branch Davidian</ENAMEX> drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> were floated at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waco</ENAMEX> (they
later turned out to be false), use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Force</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> in the
raid may be legally justifiable. In fact, it is already public record that
other parts of the military assisted in planning the raid and providing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX>. But the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Force</ENAMEX> participation remains unknown. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commandos</ENAMEX> are found to have played an active role in the raid, their
participation may have crossed the line.

            Next question?
