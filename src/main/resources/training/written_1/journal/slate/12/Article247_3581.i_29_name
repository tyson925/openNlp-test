            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter S. Mossberg</ENAMEX>, who writes the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Personal Technology"</ENAMEX> column for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> ,
but whose true expertise lies in the field of music (when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> worked at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureau</ENAMEX>, he was the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> there who knew
all the words to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woody Guthrie</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Union Maid"</ENAMEX>), takes exception to 
this column's assertion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX> were not the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> large
mainstream <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> to embrace rock 'n' roll (which previously, of course, had
been embraced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>). In an e-mail, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mossberg</ENAMEX> writes:

            

               
                  I agree that it's absurd to make some sharp delineation between
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1950s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early '60s</TIMEX>. Clearly there were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boomers</ENAMEX> who
didn't get rock music, and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the prior generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> who
did get it. Early rock co-existed with pallid pop music. Nothing was as
clear-cut about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX> as it seems from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s perspective.
               

               But let me tell you why I think you may have been too dismissive when you
wrote, "Were the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> who turned <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'Rock Around the Clock</ENAMEX>' and 'Heartbreak
Hotel' into hit records <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 and 10 years old</TIMEX>? Of course they weren't. They were
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX> who'd been born during and shortly before <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II."

               As a second-year <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boomer</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1947</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about six months</TIMEX> younger than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>),
I can testify that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the ages of 9 and 13</TIMEX> we were very musically adept in
my whitebread, spanking new suburban neighborhood in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">R.I.</ENAMEX> And we had
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">allowances</ENAMEX>, and we bought rock records. It was during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those years</TIMEX> in the late
'50s, in fact, and not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '60s</TIMEX>, that many of us older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boomers</ENAMEX> were first
turned on to rock, began following the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, and--defying parental
wishes--began listening clandestinely to the handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJs</ENAMEX> who played rock 'n'
roll. And, believe me, if a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ</ENAMEX>, that was a lot.

               It was during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> grades for me--not high
school--that I began to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">45s</ENAMEX> and listen to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elvis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Little</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duane Eddy</ENAMEX>. Now, we didn't go to any <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Haley</ENAMEX> concerts, and
older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX>, with more money and freedom, probably did play a big role in all
of that. But there were significant differences between most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in these
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>.

               Unlike our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX>, I knew of nobody in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late '50s</TIMEX> who
had ever listened to, or liked, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Sinatra</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perry Como</ENAMEX>. That
was our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' music, we thought. The prior generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> thought folk
music was the clean-cut <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingston Trio</ENAMEX> ; by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early '60s</TIMEX>, we were into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>, and through them, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dylan</ENAMEX>. (When I marched on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&M</ENAMEX> were
singing away on the steps of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln Memorial</ENAMEX>.) They tended to like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boone</ENAMEX>'s covers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Richard</ENAMEX>. We liked the real thing.
               

               Remember that most early rock 'n' roll <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haley</ENAMEX>
and--shockingly--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elvis</ENAMEX>, had repertoires that included lots of swing-type music,
or syrupy ballads or "pop" tunes, which made them transitional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> able to
appeal to both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>. Early rock was crossover music that allowed the
older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> to support it, until the transition stopped and it got too loud and
unruly for many of them. By then, it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '60s</TIMEX>, and we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boomers</ENAMEX> were the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX>. So it all worked out.

               A terrific account of all of this (though not of the demographics per se) is
in the new book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Flowers in the Dustbin</ENAMEX>
                  , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Miller</ENAMEX>. He does
a great job chronicling the early proto-rock, among other things.
               

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> is intrigued, but not surprised, to learn that his friend
Mossberg was a-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rockin</ENAMEX>' and a-rollin' from the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>. Indeed, Chatterbox
finds it impossible to picture <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mossberg</ENAMEX> as anything other than a
precocious know-it-all. The question is, how many other
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9-year-olds</TIMEX>--exempting the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mossberg</ENAMEX>'s whitebread suburban
neighborhood, who no doubt fell under his influence--were buying rock 'n' roll
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX>? Surely not many. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> concedes he may be wrong about this,
and invites others in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mossberg</ENAMEX>'s age cohort (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">52</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>) to submit testimonials on
this question to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fray</ENAMEX> (to do so, click below).
