            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> lead with the situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Timor</ENAMEX>,
where militias closely associated with the military and police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> are routing the largely pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">secessionist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populace</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> leads instead with
the decision by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> to ban the use of physical coercion in
the interrogation of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>, a story that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> and
WP front. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> puts its on-the-ground <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Timor</ENAMEX> dispatch
inside, although it fronts a report that at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>, there is
gathering sentiment favoring sending in a multinational military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, most
likely to be led by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, to re-establish order. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> include some details about this in their leads. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX>
runs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Timor</ENAMEX> deep inside and leads with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>'s to-be-released-today
health-care proposal, based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a weekend</TIMEX> interview with the paper. All in all,
a pretty slow news <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>: Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> run front-page
pictures of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen Funt</ENAMEX> to flag the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candid Camera</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creator</ENAMEX>'s obit
inside.

            The papers agree that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Timor</ENAMEX>, anti-independence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangs</ENAMEX> took
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>, forcing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> to evacuate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, running off the
region's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Peace</ENAMEX> Prize-winning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX>, shooting up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>, burning <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>, and shooting and terrorizing the general
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populace</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> or more have been killed and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of
residents have fled. The papers agree that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> units
have been actively and directly involved in the terror. What is less clear is
whether this was orchestrated from the highest levels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX>
government or rather was the more spontaneous expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>' personal
sentiments. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keith Richburg</ENAMEX> quotes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomats</ENAMEX> and military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> as
saying that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East Timorese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> have
deserted their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> and joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">militias</ENAMEX>, and even cites some unconfirmed
reports of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> firing on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>.

            All the accounts of a possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX>-approved military response stress that
the deployment of such a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> is being viewed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomats</ENAMEX> as possible only in
the unlikely event that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> consents. Indeed, notes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> has been so defiant of international opinion that it has
allowed/perpetrated the violence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Timor</ENAMEX> even while being dependent on
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> in outside aid to recover from its economic collapse.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> tells USAT that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in a speech he will unveil
a health-care proposal that promises to provide affordable coverage by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX> for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 11 million</NUMEX> currently uninsured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> declines
to give the paper any of the details. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> shows a similar gift for
information-free discourse in his comment on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FALN</ENAMEX> clemency controversy,
quoted in the WP : "The proper course of action is to wait to review the
analysis now underway that will be presented to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later this week</TIMEX>
and I'll defer judgment until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that time</TIMEX>."

            Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> report that a new study concludes that
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> lead the industrialized world in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> worked and in productivity.
According to the stories, over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 15 years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> workers
have essentially changed places work-wise. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> and
DaimlerChrysler are offering to expand job-security protections to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAW</ENAMEX> members
to the point where many (those with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX> on the job already) would have
lifetime job security against outsourcing or job streamlining.

            The WP op-ed page has <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kissinger</ENAMEX> giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> advice
about how to improve <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kissinger</ENAMEX>'s advice includes
remembering that human-rights <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> "need to be brought into some
relationship with other objectives of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> foreign policy. And the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">experiences of Haiti</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> should inspire some caution
about how easy it is to impose our values." How good then for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Lewis</ENAMEX>,
over on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> op-ed page, to recall <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kissinger</ENAMEX>'s reaction when, in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>, it was pointed out to him that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> to invade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Timor</ENAMEX>. "[H]<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ow</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> quotes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kissinger</ENAMEX>, "can it be in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> national
interest for us to ... kick the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Indonesians in the teeth?</ENAMEX>"

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> reports that during an appearance at an elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> to
publicize his pitch to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> construction and modernization,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> used an electric screwdriver and admitted he'd never even seen one
before. Oddly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> doesn't remind the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> of a similar episode during
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> election when it was apparent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> had never before seen a
supermarket check-out product scanner.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> reports that yesterday <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muammar Qaddafi</ENAMEX> introduced to the world
press a project he's been working on in secret for some time: a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-passenger</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> called the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rocket of the Jamahiriya</ENAMEX>." This is, the press was told,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaddafi</ENAMEX>'s personal contribution to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">world</ENAMEX> peace.
