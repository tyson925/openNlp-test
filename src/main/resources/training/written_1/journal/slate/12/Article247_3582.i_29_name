            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew</ENAMEX>, please don't send your guidebooks off to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fresh Kills</ENAMEX> just yet (did
they overlook this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">site</ENAMEX>? Located in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Staten Island</ENAMEX>, it's the largest and most
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poetically</ENAMEX> named garbage dump in the world). I don't think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> will make
any of our books extinct, or even slow their evolution into ever-diversified
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. To toss off a clich√© of my own, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> is just too unruly. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the
marvelous things about our books is the way they organize a major metropolis
and its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of component parts into a digestible, unintimidating,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">navigable</ENAMEX> package. They tell us what to see, where to start, and-this is very
important-what to do in case we lose a wallet or rupture an appendix. The Web
is host to some excellent travel sites, but you'd have to visit several of them
in order to produce a commensurately comprehensive guide. You wouldn't have a
table of contents or an index. And you'd have to traipse around with a thick
sheaf of computer printouts instead of a slim paperback.

            That said, if electronic books ever replace printed ones, travel guidebooks
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">will</ENAMEX> surely be <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> among the wired. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> will probably hit the road with
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palm Pilot</ENAMEX> XXVIIs stuffed in their backpacks. Instead of buying an actual book
before they depart (or hunkering down with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of them in the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnes</ENAMEX> &
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noble</ENAMEX> and scribbling down the best of each, as I usually do) they'll simply
download the latest version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lonely Planet Guide to Graceland</ENAMEX>, which will
contain constantly updated train schedules, hotel prices, and restaurant menus.
They'll enjoy the coherence and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of our guidebooks, but also the
accuracy and timeliness of the Web.

            To finish off the book reviews, let me predict that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Access Guides</ENAMEX> may be
out of business by then. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Each day</TIMEX> I've tested it, my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Access Guide</ENAMEX> has lagged
farther and farther behind the others. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Saul Wurman</ENAMEX>, the information
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">impresario</ENAMEX> who created the series, started off in the telephone book business
(click here for
his illustrious bio), and his guides work very much like your local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>
Pages. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX>, restaurant, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> has its own entry. If you know what you
want to look up and what it's called, you'll be fine. If not, you'll have to
read the whole damned book. There's no narrative to tie the entries together
and little indication that some are more special than others (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbide</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbon Building</ENAMEX>, a "deco masterpiece," gets the same amount of space as the
local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eddie Bauer</ENAMEX>).

            Another example: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> is graced with a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20-mile</NUMEX> belt of parkland along its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lakefront</ENAMEX>. I've been running there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> are among the most
scenic and immaculately maintained I've ever seen. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> also features
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beaches</ENAMEX>, volleyball and tennis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini golf</ENAMEX>, and even an outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gym</ENAMEX> with
a full set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nautilus</ENAMEX> machines, all accessible to the public. In short, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lakefront</ENAMEX> is one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s most defining, enviable, and enjoyable
features-like what <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> are to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> or the beach is to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. But
Access consigns it to a short sidebar, titled "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cycling</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>," that fails
to describe many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>'s offerings, or more important, its central role
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">city</ENAMEX> life. There's no mention of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> in the table of contents or the
index, so unless you happened to read Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83</NUMEX> in detail, you'd never learn
about it at all.

            I disagree with your suggestion that a guidebook contain only endorsements.
I want <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> to include a few well-chosen pans, to steer me away from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overrated</ENAMEX> and the overpriced. Then again, perhaps you're just a more chipper
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX> than I am; you seemed to enjoy all your guidebooks equally. Or did
you? I know our dialogue is over, but I still wish I could ask you where you're
going next and which of these guides you would bring along. From now on, I'll
be traveling with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lonely Planet</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insight</ENAMEX>. Maybe I'll continue to breeze
through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fodor's</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Compass</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frommer's</ENAMEX> in airport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bookstores</ENAMEX>. As for Access, I
hope it goes the way of steamer trunks and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan-Am</ENAMEX>.

            Happy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> to you,
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Jodi</ENAMEX>
