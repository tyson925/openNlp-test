            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey Brent</ENAMEX>--

            Nice to meet you. I'm a longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> of your work, and though we don't
always agree--or because we don't--I'm glad to have the chance to engage
directly.

            It's a nasty, muggy <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> where I am, the worst of both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX>: dark as
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only fall</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX> can be, but still as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">humid as summer</TIMEX>. Even so, I couldn't
help but gloat a little as I read the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>. What could be more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">delicious</ENAMEX> than
the flap <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> have got themselves into over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FALN</ENAMEX>? Of
course--maybe not "of course" from your point of view?--I love to see them trip
over their own manipulative politics. He's had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 3,000</NUMEX> requests for
clemency over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>, and this one--for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> so
unremorseful that they didn't even defend themselves at their trial--is only
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> he's offered. But we're supposed to believe it has nothing to do with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> candidacy and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> who could help swing
that election? Sure. If you buy that, you must still be living in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '50s</TIMEX>, or
whenever it was that we last took what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> said at face value. Of
course, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> does this sort of thing all the time, and often just as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brazenly</ENAMEX>--but here for once, the public caught him at it. Much more
interesting, in my view, than catching him with any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>. This is what's
really wrong with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manipulator</ENAMEX> who thinks that his personal
ends justify just about any means, no matter how unprincipled.

            But for me, this case goes well beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, and the thing I'm really
glad to see exposed and embarrassed is the time-honored practice of a candidate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pandering</ENAMEX> to an ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituency</ENAMEX>. Sure, that's the oldest form of "diversity
politics" in the books. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Candidates</ENAMEX> have been doing it in big <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a century</TIMEX> now. And sure, I know the argument: If was OK when the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> were benefiting, how can I object <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> do? But
the point here--and what's great is that it's so obvious--is that most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> don't care one way or the other about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FALN</ENAMEX>. Not only
are they unsure about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>' cause--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> independence--but
they've never rallied around opposition politics, let alone the use of
terrorist violence. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who care about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FALN</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX>: the
left-leaning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> that ruled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> ousted
them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years ago</TIMEX>. They wrap themselves in the flag of ethnicity, but on this
and many, many other issues, they don't represent anyone but other political
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> like themselves. Of course, this is hardly a new discovery, and it
isn't really delicious at all. But it's nice to see it exposed so clearly for a
change--not only the fake ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, but also the folly of pandering to
them, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clintons</ENAMEX> tried to do. And now that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX>'s backed off, of
course, those so-called ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> are lashing her mercilessly. But because
she and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> have played this ethnic game for so long--and
generally have so much invested in it--they can't even denounce her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">attackers</ENAMEX>.

            I don't know--I don't really like to gloat. The more I think about, the more
it all depresses me. This is what we call political debate? This is what passes
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">democracy</ENAMEX>? The only thing worse going on in the news now in my view is
what's passing for a discussion of race among the presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. But
that's a whole other topic--maybe over lunch?

            Are you gloating over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> or wincing?

            Looking forward to hearing from you.

            All best,
Tamar
