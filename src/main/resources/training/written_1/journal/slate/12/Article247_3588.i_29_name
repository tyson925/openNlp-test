            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kansas Board of Education</ENAMEX> voted to remove evolution from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">state</ENAMEX>'s required curriculum. The decision was a victory for those who favor at
least equal treatment for creationism. But several

                  Slate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, responding to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Saletan</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Frame Game</ENAMEX> on the controversy, note that while there
is basically only one theory of evolution, there are many different theories of
creation. Here are a few:

            
               Buddhism , unlike most religions, does not have a single creation
story. There is, instead, an endless cycle of creation, destruction, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rebirth</ENAMEX>. At the beginning of each kalpa (or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>), there is nothing but water
and darkness. As <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> passes, land slowly forms on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>'s surface. The
only living <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> are spiritual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX> who were reborn at the end of the
previous kalpa. Eventually, one of these being is tempted by the pleasures of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">earth</ENAMEX>, abandons his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>-life, and takes on the form of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. As others
follow, they begin to experience the jealousy, desire, and misery of a physical
existence (this is the period in which we are living). In time, the world
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dissolves</ENAMEX>, returning all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creatures</ENAMEX> to the soul-life and beginning the cycle
once again.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> creation stories are varied. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Fans</ENAMEX> --a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bantu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX>--tell of
an imperfect creation. The god, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nzame</ENAMEX>, created the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> and populated it with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. Deciding that it needed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX>, he made <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fam</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. But Fam
became insolent, abusing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and neglecting to worship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nzame</ENAMEX>. So, Nzame
buried the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> in soil and tried again--this time, beginning with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. As
its leaves fell, they became the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> of the new world. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nzame</ENAMEX> then
made a new, more humble <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. Needing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> created a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> from a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. Together, they had many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindus</ENAMEX> also have multiple creation stories, though they are all seen
as different reflections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brahman</ENAMEX>--the uniting holy principle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hinduism</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rig Veda</ENAMEX>--a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hymnal</ENAMEX>--describes creation through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gods</ENAMEX>' sacrifice of
Purusa, the primal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. Purusa was, at the time, the entire universe. When he
was sacrificed, his upper <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three quarters</TIMEX> became the immortal heavens, and the
lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> became the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>. The human castes came from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Purusa</ENAMEX>, too: His
arms became the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX>, his legs the commoner, and his feet the serf. Another
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu</ENAMEX> story describes the earth's origins in primordial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>. The seas, which
desired to reproduce, made a golden <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prajapati</ENAMEX>--one of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">divine</ENAMEX> forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brahman</ENAMEX>--sprang from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>. As he cried out, the sound of his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">voice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resonating</ENAMEX> created the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>, the sky, and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Judeo-Christian Bible</ENAMEX>'s book of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genesis</ENAMEX> recounts a story of
creation ex 
               nihilo , or out of nothing. In the beginning God
created the heavens and the earth--a formless and empty mass over which He
hovered. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next five days</TIMEX>, God improved His creation, adding day and
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, the sun and moon, the land and seas, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. On the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixth day</TIMEX>, God created <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in His own image: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam</ENAMEX> was produced from dust, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve from Adam</ENAMEX>'s rib. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">God</ENAMEX> told them to reproduce and rule over the world's
living things. Then, God rested.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navajo</ENAMEX> story is one of creation by emergence--that is, that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> slowly evolved from primitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creatures</ENAMEX> as they journeyed upward from
the world's womb. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> worlds in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navajo</ENAMEX> story, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of which lie
below our <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>, and one--a land of perfection and harmony--which lies above.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> began as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> who inhabited the dark, watery first world. The insect
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> did not recognize sexual taboos, which angered the gods and led to their
expulsion from each of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> worlds. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> world, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>
became (or, according to some versions of the story, helped create) <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">First Man</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Woman</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> whom the gods taught the
skills they would need to survive in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> world. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> then climbed a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reed</ENAMEX> that brought them to the present <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>. They created the mountains,
weather, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> they had known below. And they brought the gods up
to join them.
