               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX>
leads with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immigration and Naturalization Service</ENAMEX>'s decision to return
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Eli√°n Gonz√°lez</ENAMEX> to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 14</TIMEX>. All other papers
front the story. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> goes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexis Herman</ENAMEX>'s
backpedaling on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</ENAMEX> directive
making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> responsible for safety and health violations in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home offices</ENAMEX>. The Wall Street
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> tops its "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">World-Wide</ENAMEX>" box with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democratic</ENAMEX>
presidential debate at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of New Hampshire</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> goes local
and off-leads the uncertain status of fighting between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechens</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grozny</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times , which leads with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State of the State</ENAMEX>
address, off-leads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gonz√°lez</ENAMEX> and reefers the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Department</ENAMEX> story.

            Officially, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> judged the case based on law and research, but anonymous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> did not want to damage
relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> when it is trying to forge new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> there. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> indicated they would oppose threatened legal moves by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gonz√°lez</ENAMEX>'s angry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, who are hosting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX>. No decision has
been made on how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eli√°n</ENAMEX> will be reunited with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> offered to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bring Juan Gonz√</ENAMEX>°lez to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> to pick the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> up, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gonz√°lez</ENAMEX> has said
it's the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>' responsibility to bring him home. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gonz√°lez</ENAMEX> senior may be
under pressure from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX>
report.

            Each story carries <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s boast that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> has
kept the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>'s plight "out of politics," but the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> dispute
that statement. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX>, whose name isn't even mentioned in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX>, is
treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> gloves in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> . Only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> reports that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> has called the situation an abduction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eli√°n</ENAMEX> has been roped into someone
else's game: He is the center of an "international tug of war" in the WP
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lede</ENAMEX> and a front-page <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> caption, and the "center of a political
tug-of-war" in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> turns him into "the central
object in a tug-of-war." How can the situation almost unanimously be a
political "tug of war" if so little is mentioned of who's tugging on the other
end?

            A flurry of calls between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> resulted in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman</ENAMEX>
recanting the home <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> directive, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> reports. The confusion
shows that telecommuting has changed the workplace so that traditional rules
and regulations may no longer apply--or perhaps no one's sure how to apply
them. Withdrawing the directive, which first made news <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, may not affect
the policy behind it. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Almost 20 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> work at home.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> front the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>'s
filing of a civil suit against stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guru</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yun Soo Oh Park</ENAMEX>--"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tokyo Joe"</ENAMEX> of
Internet fame. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Park</ENAMEX>, accused of committing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> counts of fraud, is said to
have advised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> to buy certain stocks, which he then sold on the sly as
their orders lifted the stocks' prices. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, he allegedly accepted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX>
shares in a cigar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boca Raton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">deli-owner</ENAMEX>; in return, he is said to
have recommended the stock to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, without revealing his relationship
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>'s complaint is its most aggressive move yet against an
Internet stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whiz</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> (in their business sections), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> report
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> revenue, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$650 million</NUMEX>, failed to match
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>' "whisper number," which in some circles doubled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, published
estimates of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500 million</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Stockholders</ENAMEX> were not impressed: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> beat the
stock down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 percent</NUMEX>, lowering its market capitalization by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4 billion</NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$24</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">billion</ENAMEX>.

            Coverage of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley-Gore</ENAMEX> debate is pot luck. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> address both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>' strengthening of earlier statements
defending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> summarizes the debate topics
as "<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>, health, ability" in its headline and mentions <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Kennedy</ENAMEX>'s
endorsement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> in its subhead. The WSJ highlights in its
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">World-Wide"</ENAMEX> column (as opposed to its story) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s accusation that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>
contorted his health care plan by claiming it would hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX>. According
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX>, the debate centered on who might be a stronger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> front-pager reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>, in the midst of a fight against the
power of money in politics, twice in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past couple months</TIMEX> urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communications Commission</ENAMEX> to act on an issue that would benefit a major
contributor to his campaign.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chechens</ENAMEX> claim to have seized a village southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grozny</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> said
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> fled the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> in desperation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureau</ENAMEX> chief
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Gordon</ENAMEX> reports from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Ossetia</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX> west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX>:
"It is impossible to verify either side's claims since the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> military has
not taken <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX>."

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Misplaced Rhetorical Imagery</ENAMEX>: In light of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s
school shootings, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> lead headline is somewhat startling: "[<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX>]
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Davis</ENAMEX> Issues a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Call to Arms</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better Teachers, Schools</ENAMEX>." Coincidentally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Pataki</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> lead, outlined changes in practices
for recruiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, saying that "right now, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colin Powell</ENAMEX> can't teach in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> that he grew up in." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> story explains that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Davis</ENAMEX> used images of warfare in his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">State of the State</ENAMEX> speech to drum
up enthusiasm for hiring and training new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>. The "war for the future,"
he said, "will be fought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> to school, classroom to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX>, desk to
desk." <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Papers</ENAMEX> knows what he means, but had hoped classroom warfare
might be left in the past.
