            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
Today , and the Wall
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Street Journal</ENAMEX> (in its "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business and Finance</ENAMEX>" box) lead with the stock
market's biggest plunge in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a year</TIMEX>--a story off-leaded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX>. The Nasdaq
index fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.6 percent</NUMEX> (after gaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>) and the Dow fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX>
percent (after gaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'99</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> attribute the sell-off to tax
incentives arriving with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the new year</TIMEX> and to heightened fears of an
interest-rate hike when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> meets on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 1</TIMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> lead with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s announcement that
he will nominate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a fourth four-year term</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> and the LAT mention <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s announcement in their
stock-market leads, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> puts it <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> from the top in
its "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business and Finance</ENAMEX>" box.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s announcement "mak[<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">es</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> what
markets had been expecting and what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> from both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> had been
endorsing for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> , however, writes that "some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in the financial markets had
begun to speculate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> might not reappoint [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX>], or that the
administration would try to influence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> interest-rate policy in exchange for
the reappointment." So, are the market dip and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX>'s appointment related?
Yes and no: While Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> laud <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s move, his announcement frees <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> from
political pressure to keep rates down. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> also blame the sell-off
on tax laws--capital gains earned now are not taxed until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 2001</TIMEX>--and an
overvalued technology sector.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> 's stock-market story describes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX>'s drop as "breathtaking" but goes on to note
that it was "long overdue" and only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX>-largest percentage drop in the
index's history. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> begin a paragraph with the same hackneyed
sentence: "The carnage was widespread." In his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> column, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Krugman</ENAMEX> asks, "Why was the market so
easily spooked? Presumably because everyone--me included--is even more confused
than usual about what stocks are really worth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> fronts an announcement by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> economic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> that
private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprises</ENAMEX> should be put on an "equal footing with state-owned
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enterprises</ENAMEX>" for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time since the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1949 revolution</ENAMEX>. Although the
Post quotes an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> labeling this a "significant ideological shift,"
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> story on the announcement, run inside, focuses instead on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>'s
inability to grow fast enough to assure jobs for its ballooning
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>.

USAT fronts and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> reefers the development of a new test for pre-cancerous
conditions in the cervix. Unlike a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pap</ENAMEX> smear, which requires a pelvic exam and
determines if cervical tissue is pre-cancerous, the new procedure tests for the
presence of a pre-cancerous virus and can be self-administered. The HPV
test--for human papilloma virus, which can cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cervical cancer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> over
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>--could save many lives in the developing world, where lack of access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pap</ENAMEX>
tests leads to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 200,000</NUMEX> preventable deaths <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> report that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexis Herman</ENAMEX> backtracked from an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">notice</ENAMEX> requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> to provide proper furniture, lighting, heating, and
ventilation systems to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> working at home. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> credits
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> --which broke the story
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>--in its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> paragraph.) "The [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> ] story raised an
important debate that we need to have about the workplace of the future," said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman</ENAMEX>, who wants to "open a dialogue on the issue" rather than inspect
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> en masse . An op-ed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> argues that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX> guidelines are part of a pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> electoral
favors to labor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> (because the guidelines discourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">telecommuters</ENAMEX>, who
are hard to organize).

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> will drop all but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> remaining misdemeanor
charges against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protestors</ENAMEX>. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protestors</ENAMEX> decried the decision;
they were looking forward to grandstanding during their trials. In the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> edition, a retrospective "news article" to
commemorate the state sesquicentennial hearkens back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an era</TIMEX> when a different
kind of justice prevailed:

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SAN FRANCISCO</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 8, 1856</TIMEX>--With the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sheriff</ENAMEX> unable, or unwilling, to keep
crime in check, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX>-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee of Vigilance</ENAMEX> stepped into the
breach. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three months</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> brags, it has hanged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
accused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">murderers</ENAMEX>, banished <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troublemakers</ENAMEX> from the region and
run untold numbers of "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sydney Ducks"</ENAMEX>--as convicts from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> are known--out
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.
