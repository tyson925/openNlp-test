            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hey,</ENAMEX>

            I've got <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matthewcooper</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> but haven't updated it in ages. You've
inspired me to try. I kept updating it with the software of a certain major
software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> and I had a lot of problems which may be my fault rather
than that of a certain major software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>. Do you contract out? Can I
be my own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webmaster</ENAMEX> or is that too autoerotic?

            Yeah, this <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> thing is wild. I haven't seen the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> TV coverage, alas,
but I can imagine they pander like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miami Herald</ENAMEX> , which is known for
that. My prediction still holds: The ex-patriots in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> will take this kid
underground before they hand him over to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daddy</ENAMEX>. We'll have an Underground
Railroad in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Little Havana</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harriet Tubman</ENAMEX> comes to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Beach</ENAMEX>--and enough
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSNBC</ENAMEX> coverage to fill that void left in our lives but not having a big trial
of the moment. Which leads one to think what will happen when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> falls?
Will the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Florida</ENAMEX> return <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> or stay in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>?

            Are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives hypocrites</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elian</ENAMEX>, as you said? I was just having
this conversation with one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>. Of course, to some degree they
are. As you said, they value the biological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> as paramount and then
subordinate it to their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX>communism. But if you think <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> is a
regime on a par with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pol Pot</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambodia</ENAMEX>--something that strikes me as
ludicrous--or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceausescu</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Romania</ENAMEX> (more plausible), then I could see the case
for insisting that he stay even if you normally favor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX>'s rights. Is that
hypocrisy? I'm not so sure. What is hypocritical is the way we've got all these
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> languishing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prisons</ENAMEX>, without any rights whatsoever to a
speedy trial, just because they came here in a less dramatic fashion than did
young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elian</ENAMEX>. I don't see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, who've been sure to pander on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elian</ENAMEX>,
speaking up for them. In any event, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>'s been so showered with gifts of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PlayStation</ENAMEX> that there's no way he's getting on the
flight back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>.

            All right, I'm gonna have a double espresso and sit through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley-Gore</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX>. (More <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Jennings</ENAMEX>! "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gentlemen</ENAMEX>, what would be your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shhed-hule</ENAMEX> for
introducing this so-called universal coverage?") I hope none of those goons we
talked <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about earlier</TIMEX> show up.

            Catch you in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>.
