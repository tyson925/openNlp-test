            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A couple of</TIMEX> notes before the actual substance--thank you for refraining from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chuckling</ENAMEX>--of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s column: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Today</ENAMEX>'s stock-market action was actually quite
fascinating to watch, especially once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early-day</TIMEX> plunge was out of the way.
Unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, when stocks fell in unison, there was a meaningful divergence
between stocks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. The most obvious example of this was the contrast between
the Dow's rise and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX>'s fall, but the more interesting example was that
by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the day</TIMEX> most (though, not all) of the tech <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">powerhouses</ENAMEX>--that is,
those with profits--had recovered sharply and were actually up on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>,
while most (though again, not all) of the Internet high-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fliers</ENAMEX>, in both the
e-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">B2B</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>, were down, often sharply. As I suggested on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>,
this kind of divergence is a good and comforting thing, since it suggests
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are distinguishing between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> rather than throwing them all
into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big buy-or-sell pot.

            The other good--and comforting--thing was that both the New York
Times and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> led with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX>'s reappointment
rather than with the market sell-off. (I realize I wrote about the
sell-off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX>, which might seem to be
discomfiting by my standards, but I've already issued too many hosannas to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Alan</ENAMEX> for another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to be interesting. Until the next <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, of course.)
For that matter, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily News</ENAMEX> put the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner-Fonda</ENAMEX> separation on its
front page. These seemed like nicely measured, and somewhat surprising,
reactions to what might have been played as a much scarier event than it really
was.

            One crucial ingredient in all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s explanations of the sell-off (and
we are now entering the putatively substantive part of the column, so watch
your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX>) was, of course, "interest-rate concerns." Unfortunately, it's
usually not explained why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are investing in stocks should be all that
concerned about interest rates. In fact, they should be--and are--concerned.
It's just that the reasons for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> are complicated, because interest
rates affect stocks in different ways and, for that matter, because there are
different interest rates to be concerned about.

            The interest rate that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> have in mind when they talk about
"interest-rate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX>" is not the interest rate that you see at the bottom of
that bug in the corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNBC</ENAMEX> screen. That's the interest rate on the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> bond. The rate most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> are talking about is the federal
funds rate, which is the interest rate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> raises or lowers in
order, in theory, to speed up or slow down the economy by increasing or
shrinking the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> money supply and indirectly raising or lowering
interest rates on things like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and home loans (since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> pass along
changes in interest rates to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>). It now appears that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> will
raise interest rates at its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> meeting, and of late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> have got it
in their heads that instead of its typical <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25-basis-point</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX> percentage
point) increase, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> is going to hike rates by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> basis points.

            These interest-rate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX>, then, are concerns that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s actions will
slow down the economy, which in turn will make corporate profits grow less
quickly than otherwise, and since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are paying prices for stocks that
assume very fast profit growth in the future, the threat of a slowing economy
makes them want to sell.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fair</ENAMEX> enough. But <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the odd things about this most recent sell-off is
that, with the exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> (which are always hit hard by interest-rate
worries), the hardest-hit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> were those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> whose profit prospects
will be the least hurt by a fed-funds hike. If you're a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX>, or an
aluminum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, or even a car <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, an interest-rate hike could
have--though I stress could--a big impact on your business. But if you're Cisco
(which I own) or another major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> of technological infrastructure to big
business, you're going to weather anything short of a complete recession,
because <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> business shows absolutely no sign of cutting back on
investment. And that's because in this competitive environment, it can't.

            So why would interest-rate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> hit the high-priced tech stocks so hard?
You might ascribe it simply to panic, which undoubtedly played a part. But
there are also <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other reasons, which have to do with that other interest
rate, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30-year</TIMEX> bond. That interest rate is effectively the
risk-free rate of return for any investment you want to make, and as the
interest rate on bonds rises, bonds become more attractive and stocks less
attractive. This has a practical consequence, which is that rising rates lead
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>--primarily, at this point--to pull money out of the stock market
and put it into bonds. And the opposite is true when rates are going in the
other direction.

            But rising rates also have a theoretical consequence that's even more
important. If you want to figure the present value of a stock--which is to say,
how much it's worth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> given how much free cash flow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is going to
generate in the future--you need to discount that cash flow by your required
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> rate of return. (If your required rate of return is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX>, then the
total free cash generated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX> needs to be divided by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>
to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">20th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">power</ENAMEX>.) And a crucial component of that rate of return is the
interest rate on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30-year</TIMEX> bond, since you know you can get that without any
risk at all.

            If interest rates rise, then, the present value of the future cash generated
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>--even if the amount of that cash is unchanged by the rise in
interest rates--shrinks. Even a relatively small rise in interest rates can
have a major effect on that present value if it's spread out over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</TIMEX>. And
since the stock prices of the most valuable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> in the world <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in
fact reflect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX>' confidence that they're still going to be generating
huge amounts of cash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years from now</TIMEX>, rising interest rates can have serious
effects on current stock prices.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>--although you'll hear plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> tell you that this is an
old-fashioned idea--a stock's price is a mechanism for discounting the future.
And as the discount rate rises, it's not surprising if stock prices fall. The
equation is not automatic or perfect. But in the long run, it's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unavoidable</ENAMEX>.
