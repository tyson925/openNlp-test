            Issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> presidential politics, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> letter and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s tax-cut plan. Issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> presidential politics, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX>'s promise to allow open <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>.

            Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> agree that the revelation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX>'s influence-peddling
letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> has hurt his campaign, although several--including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Gigot</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NewsHour With Jim Lehrer</ENAMEX> ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tucker Carlson</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>'s
Late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edition</ENAMEX> )--think that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> is just defending his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX>, as he was elected to do. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pundits</ENAMEX> disagree on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s sweeping
tax-cut proposal. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Klein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Meet the</ENAMEX>
Press ) notes that the cut is bigger than the congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>'s
(doomed) proposal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last fall</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Hunt</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Capital Gang</ENAMEX> ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Broder</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Washington Week in</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review</ENAMEX> ) think that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> care more about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and
health care than taxes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Shields</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NewsHour</ENAMEX> ) remarks that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jack</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX>'s aggressive tax-cutting campaign strategy didn't work in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1988 GOP</ENAMEX>
primary, but his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gigot</ENAMEX>, responds that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>'s emphasis on tax-cut
moderation apes the failed electoral strategies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>) and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX> (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>). On <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Meet the Press</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindsey Graham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S.C.</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain supporter</ENAMEX>, thinks that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>'s critique that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s tax plan as too
large is not working. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John McLaughlin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Kudlow</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Warren</ENAMEX> (all of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaughlin Group</ENAMEX> ) enthuse over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s recent debate
performances.

            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX>--including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mara Liasson</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Washington Week</ENAMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mark</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shields</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NewsHour and Capital Gang</ENAMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Donaldson</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This Week</TIMEX> ), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Begala</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSNBC</ENAMEX> coverage of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> debate)--think that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s outspoken
advocacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> will hurt them in the general election. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gigot</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NewsHour</ENAMEX> ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Roberts</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Late Edition</ENAMEX> ) contrast
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s ideological approach to this issue with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s pragmatic
approach. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tucker Carlson</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Late Edition</ENAMEX> ) notes that only a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> with
no security threats could devote so much attention to a "boutique issue" like
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>'s homosexual policy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Stephanopoulos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George F. Will</ENAMEX>
(both of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">This Week</ENAMEX> ) think the issue is a red <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herring</ENAMEX>, because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
can override any executive order that overturns "don't ask, don't tell."
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Carlson</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Capital Gang</ENAMEX> ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Klein</ENAMEX> say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aloofness</ENAMEX> and condescension still hurt his popularity, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX> predicts that
if he is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nominee</ENAMEX> his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> votes against the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War</ENAMEX> and
welfare reform will haunt him.

Miscellany: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John McLaughlin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Warren</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eleanor Clift</ENAMEX> (of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaughlin Group</ENAMEX> ) call the new criterion for participating in
general-election presidential debates "undemocratic." (A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> must have
at least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 percent</NUMEX> support in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> national polls.) They argue that any party
qualifying for federal matching funds should get to participate. On
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox News</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> also voices disagreement with the rule, saying
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reform Party</ENAMEX> has a "strong case" that it should be included in the
debates, even without <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 percent</NUMEX> support. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Face the Nation</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Ventura</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ref.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minn.</ENAMEX>, notes that he had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 10 percent</NUMEX> support when
he debated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks later</TIMEX> he won the election with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37 percent</NUMEX>. ... On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Larry King</ENAMEX>
Live (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>), both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Dole</ENAMEX> say that the general election will
be close, not a blowout by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>. Appearing with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> again on This
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Week</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX> predicts that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> will win the nomination (although he
still will not endorse him). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Roberts</ENAMEX> opines that although Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> has
proved to be an awful presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">campaigner</ENAMEX>, her popularity among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> will
be hard for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> to resist when he selects his running mate. ... When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elizabeth</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> praises <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s "executive experience" <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">on This Week</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Donaldson</ENAMEX>
points out that her own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> had no such experience when he ran for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>.

            

               Last Word
            

            

               Look, I've always had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> principles. One is make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureaucracies</ENAMEX> react on
behalf of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, do whatever I can to increase competition
and lower costs in telecommunications. Those are the guiding principles I've
had. Today, we are asking the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to release all correspondence
that I've had with every government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. But finally, let me remind you, I'm
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> that is designated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to oversight
[<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX>] the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>. And it's my responsibility to try to see and make them act. And
so I believe that the record will be clear that I've done that on behalf of the
consumer.
