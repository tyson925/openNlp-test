            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> may want to reconsider the
placement of an advertisement Chatterbox spied <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> while riding the
subway into work. The ad was on the platform for the inbound red-line train at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Judiciary Square</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. Dedicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> antitrust
trial and savvy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insiders</ENAMEX> know this to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway stop</ENAMEX> for the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courthouse</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s fate is at this very minute being
decided. If the presiding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> case, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Penfield Jackson</ENAMEX>,
takes the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX> to work, this is probably where he gets off in the
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>.

            It was therefore with some surprise that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> noticed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>
placed an ad in this spot for Windows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> is widely suspected to
harbor ambitions of world conquest, but it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX>'s impression that the
company wished to downplay any such ambitions while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> considered
whether to break it up into itty-bitty pieces.

            What, then, is one to make of this ad? Here is the text (superimposed on a
photograph of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> flag snapping in a stiff breeze):

            

               
                  The biggest .<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX> of them all isn't a .<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX> at all.
It's the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, and it created the Internet.
Imagine what it can do with Windows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>.
               

               Windows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s business starts here. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microsoft</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com/federal</ENAMEX>

            

            The ad's intent, obviously, is to
invite government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to consider the benefits of upgrading their computer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> to Windows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. One could read the text as an innocent pitch for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nifty</ENAMEX> product that could help <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uncle Sam</ENAMEX> do his job. But to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX>, the tone
seems further to suggest that the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is a big software company
that would be well advised to merge with another big software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> called
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>. If it doesn't ... well, who's to say whether those poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saps</ENAMEX> at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture Department</ENAMEX> will ever be able to keep track of the price of pork
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bellies</ENAMEX>? The "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s business," after all, "starts here ."
