            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Jeffrey</ENAMEX>:

            I think there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> questions which have to be answered in this "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TV Club</ENAMEX>."
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is, can we find something to say about <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sopranos</ENAMEX> not
already said in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of articles on the subject, including the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> by
you? And the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is, is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second season</TIMEX> any good? Partly as a cheap way to
build suspense, and partly to force <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> to plow through my pet theories
before giving them the goods, I'm going to take a stab at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> question
and leave the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> one for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>.

            Here's my theory about what makes <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sopranos</ENAMEX> different from other
TV shows and movies about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mafia</ENAMEX> . I think <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sopranos</ENAMEX> brings
the understatement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> short story to a subject usually treated as
high drama or farce. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godfather</ENAMEX> is an opera in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> acts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martin</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scorsese</ENAMEX>'s brilliant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian-American</ENAMEX> movies strive for, and often achieve, the
altitude of classical tragedy--they tell the stories of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> whose fates are
the result of their own flawed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">natures</ENAMEX>. ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoodFellas</ENAMEX> was a jaunty
laugh-fest for its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX>, but that was just <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scorsese</ENAMEX>'s setup for
disaster.) The comedies, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prizzi</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Honor and Analyze This</ENAMEX> ,
are meant to cut through the globby schmaltz of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mob</ENAMEX> drama by showing us wise
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> as goofballs. When <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last season</TIMEX> began, it looked like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sopranos</ENAMEX>
was a comedy, too--a spoof about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mobster</ENAMEX> with spoiled, nagging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and
mother problems who goes to see a shrink. But where the show departs from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">norm</ENAMEX> is that it eschews both caricature and melodrama (though it has elements
of both) for something that has the weight of, and comes across as, realism.
(How realistic it actually is, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mob Reporter</ENAMEX>, I hope you are going to tell
us.) I mean, does this or does this not sound like your standard short-form
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suburbiana</ENAMEX>? It's about the little moments of anomie in the daily routine,
underscored by cheerful violence and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tarantino</ENAMEX>-esque riffing. It's about teen
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anorexia</ENAMEX> and pre-teen rapster attitudinizing and brand-name <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chitchat</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">unbearable</ENAMEX> self-loathing and intergenerational weirdness.
            

            Maybe I'm being pretentious here and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoehorning</ENAMEX> pop culture into a literary
context to which it doesn't belong, because television is obviously less
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compressed</ENAMEX> and more mundane than the movies. A series has to have the
open-endedness of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life, or else it would come abruptly to an end. But
even nighttime dramas remain tightly structured around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15-minute</TIMEX> segments,
which means that points have to be hammered into your head for fear you'll
forget what happened from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> commercial to the next. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sopranos</ENAMEX> takes
advantage of its commercial-free environment to be comparatively fearless in
the face of flat dramatic affect. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Characters</ENAMEX> register information with the
tiniest of gestures--all <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edie Falco</ENAMEX> has to do is not move her facial muscles
when her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> and would-be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> lets something slip that suggests he may be
toying with her, and we know that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carmela Soprano</ENAMEX> just grasped something
important. How important we won't know for several episodes, when she gives him
the lowdown with the kind of brutal, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">layered insight</ENAMEX> into his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> you
usually don't see outside of novels.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> also grant us a fairly high tolerance for boredom. This comes
across most vividly in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melfi</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. I love how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tony</ENAMEX> taps his shoes with
hostile insecurity and looks around at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychiatrist</ENAMEX>'s weird <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>'s-office
art, avoiding her eyes as he refuses to talk, the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> do. You've seen
this scene <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</NUMEX> times before (especially in Analyze This ), but it
never goes on so long, or with so many sudden changes in mood. You can tell
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> trust that the payoff will be worth it. It is,
too--remember the time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony</ENAMEX> is getting ready to call it quits with Melfi
and she asks, in her protracted, oracular intonation: "What do you want to say
to me?" And he replies, as if drugged, "I had a dream," which is that his penis
fell off and he's running around holding it up while he looks for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who
fixes his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincolns</ENAMEX> to screw it back on, at which point a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX> swoops down and
snaps it out of his hands. It's a moment of sheer absurdity played straight and
almost in slow motion, until we realize belatedly that the escalating
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surrealism</ENAMEX> has just earned us the only weeping session of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX>. And
they're <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony</ENAMEX> 's tears, which is inevitable but still shocking.

            Which brings us to what makes <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sopranos</ENAMEX> not just different but
good. There's the writing. I think what I like best about that is not the
attention the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> pay to the details of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian-American</ENAMEX> sociology, not the
witty bullshitting sessions among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX>, and not the way the
plot lines mess with genre expectations, so that the worst thing that can
happen to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Soprano Jr.</ENAMEX> is not that he gets beaten up by a school bully
but that he doesn't get beaten up, because that means he learns that his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are afraid of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>. I like the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tony</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soprano</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who is trying in surprisingly good faith and with honest
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introspection</ENAMEX> to wake up to what he is--an adulterous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, a bad example to
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of a criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and an infanticidal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>. (Of
course, he is also a killer and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thief</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> facts about himself he hasn't
quite dealt with yet.) By taking him and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carmela</ENAMEX> seriously, by making them
neither monsters nor the butt of jokes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> grant them dignity and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathos</ENAMEX>. That, in turn, demythologizes the world they inhabit. Making them human
brings <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> almost for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mob</ENAMEX>'s human costs.

            I haven't begun to talk about what may be the best part of the show--the
acting. Any thoughts?

            Yours,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judith</ENAMEX>
