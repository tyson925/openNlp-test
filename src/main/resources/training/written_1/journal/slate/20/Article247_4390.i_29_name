            I have been asked to kick off this
discussion with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX> about what may be termed the rapid colonization of the
Internet. As with all new spaces, someone has to figure out the rights and
duties of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> to that new world. And to do that it becomes
important to use, but not abuse, the analogies that are available to us from
existing spaces. In doing this inquiry, we can work the issue descriptively,
and ask how things have gone. But the focus, I think, of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX>'s book, is to
ask the normative question, given who we are as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, what ought to be the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> in which this new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> is occupied by its new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX>?

            In answering that question, I'll take my cue from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX>'s favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foil</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libertarian</ENAMEX>, to see how he or she would inhabit that space. I might also state
from the outset that I take this tack with a certain rooting interest, since my
affection for libertarian thought (at least of the limited-government variety)
long antedates my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> with cyberspace. In so doing, I shall break ranks,
however, from those cyberspace <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">devotees</ENAMEX> who think, on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX>'s account, that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyberspace</ENAMEX> is unique because its basic structure, or its "nature," rules out of
bound any form of effective state regulation.

            I confess that this is not my understanding of the problem at all. The use
of "nature" as a trope for libertarian thought goes back a long way before
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyberspace</ENAMEX>. There were lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">libertarians</ENAMEX> who thought that human beings were
by nature free, or that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> could acquire property by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> possession
(that is, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">non-lawyers</ENAMEX>, the capture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> or movables, or the
occupation of land): Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation</ENAMEX> was called the "natural mode" of
occupation. But these efforts to win the libertarian battle by appealing to
some sort of natural law, natural right, or natural necessity, always turned
out to be losers. Someone could come along and argue that the brute fact of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">possession</ENAMEX> did not translate itself into a right. But, of course, skepticism
could run in every conceivable direction at once, so that once the challenge
was made, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> riposte was possible: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Animals</ENAMEX>, lands, and chattels are
not communal by nature, either. Someone has to come up with an argument that
shows why their preferred form of social <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> should induce the rest of
us as rational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to sign on to their program. Stated in that way, the case
for private property rests on the incentives that it creates for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">preservation</ENAMEX> and spread of wealth, while the case against it rests on similar
utilitarian commitments: giving private ownership to a river blocks
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transportation</ENAMEX>, recreation, and aesthetic values. And then one has to pair up
different regimes of ownership with different kinds of assets.

            So it is with cyberspace. It is quite possible to think that it is best for
government to have a copy of each and every communication that takes place
across the net; and someone armed with that conviction could think it proper to
stage nighttime raids in private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> to shut down nonconforming machines. Or
we could simply refuse to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to communicate over the net, much the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> in which the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> refused to allow private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to
communicate with each other by telephone. So I quite agree that the legal
structure, sensible or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Draconian</ENAMEX> as it might be, can shape the nature of
interactions on the net, just as it has shaped interaction first on land and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sea</ENAMEX>, and then on the spectrum. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX> wants to call the sum of regulation,
public and private, code, so be it. But I don't see what the use of that
terminology, which cuts at variance with ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, adds to the
discussion of the matter.

            That said, I think that it is important to answer the question of why so
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are attracted to the Net call themselves or think of themselves
as libertarian. Here on earth, the libertarian is not an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anarchist</ENAMEX> who
thinks that all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> conduct is bad and all private conduct good. He does
not believe, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX> would have him say, that "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, in the modern
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">libertarian</ENAMEX>'s view, is the threat to liberty, private action is not" (Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX>).
Nor would a libertarian accept that his goal "is focused on reducing
government's power." That is surely the current objective, given the bloated
government that we have. But it is not the way in which a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">libertarian</ENAMEX>--traditional or modern--thinks about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> if we start, as
political theory often starts, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of nature. Rather, the libertarian
is someone whose objective function starts with the goal of minimizing the use
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> and fraud in human interactions. The hard part of the system is to
figure out a way in which that minimization takes place over both public and
private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX>: Aggression by private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> produces small gains and very
large losses; which is why we allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> in self-defense. But aggression--that
is, the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>--is subject to the same peril, and becomes
even more dangerous if the state falls into the wrong hands when it has a
monopoly of force against all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately, the world is such that we
will not minimize the total amount of aggression by reducing the amount of
government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aggression</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>: That is why the libertarian is not an anarchist.
But we would like, with some sense of rough justice, to create a system in
which each increment of government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> results in a greater decrement of
private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, so that at the margin the sum of both is minimized. But even
that program is called into question at least in part because some government
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coercion</ENAMEX> is justified, such as taxes to secure the creation of infrastructure
and the police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> to prevent private aggression (while curbing the excesses
of rogue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>).

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> real dispute is just how much force results in the social optimum. If
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> looks to the Internet it is clear that we can get along with a lot less
government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> than in other places. Physical aggression against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> is
ruled out in part by the anonymous participation that is possible online. And
there is a widespread recognition of the inability to form a complex
infrastructure by largely private means. Someone, perhaps the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, has to organize some
infrastructure over which all communications must travel. But then it is
possible (as in physical space) to add on to that collective spine all sorts of
"gated" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> in cyberspace, which can be subject to their own internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> and rules. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX> is right to point out that the architecture of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> system is more centralized (to its detriment) than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>
system. But to a libertarian, that is just fine, since each of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> is internally organized under a principle of unanimous consent.
But it is the want of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> and the successful nature of voluntary interactions
that allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to see how much can be done without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.

            But still the idea that liberty converges onto anarchy seems to me to be
misguided. It is still possible to steal confidential information that is
transferred on the net, and so we need at a minimum some law of privacy and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX> secrets. It is possible to defame <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> over the net, and to do so far
and wide: The problem of multi-jurisdiction squabbles over libel and slander
does not disappear It is possible to blackmail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> over the net, as well.
And so it goes. As a libertarian, I don't see the net as a safe harbor from
government regulation. But I do see it as a place in which the social successes
from following libertarian norms of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, fraud, and taxation, for example,
yield pretty positive results. And if those principles work so well in
cyberspace, then maybe we should have a greater attraction to them in our more
earthbound behaviors as well. That said, it's over to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX> to explain why the
same version of sensible libertarianism (private property, freedom of contract,
some state supplied infrastructure, and easy taxation) should not guide our
activities in cyberspace as it does on earth.
