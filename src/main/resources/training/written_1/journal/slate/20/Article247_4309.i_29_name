            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Jack</ENAMEX>,

            The thing I find most disheartening about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX>'s book is probably best
summed up by an oft-used <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> line: "He jests at scars that never felt a
wound." That is: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX>'s writing and thinking betrays almost no familiarity
with what is actually required to produce good journalism. He criticizes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> (mostly political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>) who maintain that an adversarial
relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is healthy, believing instead that some fabled
cooperation with civic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> would be better.

            But what about when the adversarial relationship comes from government
itself? Here's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> example from my backyard: Shortly after taking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> began stonewalling the most routine media
requests for information. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> instance, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> denied a request by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Daily News</ENAMEX> , made under the local <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Freedom of Information</ENAMEX> law,
for a list of all investigations commenced by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year</TIMEX>.
Just a list--as had been provided by every previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> in recent
memory.

            What're the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> and city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> supposed to do? Go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>,
and hope that the relationship will be healed through some kind of feel-good
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">civic</ENAMEX> project between the paper and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX>? Given the politically corrupt
relationship that exists between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX>,
that'd be the worst possible journalistic outcome. To its credit, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily</ENAMEX>
News sued, and only under court order did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> provide the
information as it was legally required to provide.

            That's an ugly and uncivil process, but it's also, under the circumstances,
the best way to serve the public interest. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX>'s worldview is so far removed
from actual journalistic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX> that it can't even imagine such a scenario,
much less grasp its importance.

            I'll conclude by trying to give an answer to the book's title question. One
thing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> should be for is independence. In my view, that doesn't
require "objectivity" or neutrality or being boring or being good
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">citizens</ENAMEX>--though it doesn't preclude any of those things either. It means
simply that the task of gathering and presenting news must be kept as separate
as humanly possible from pretty much everything: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>'s own business plans. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX>'s book demonstrates so little
understanding of that core journalistic value that it paints itself out of the
picture.

            Best,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jim</ENAMEX>
