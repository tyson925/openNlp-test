            No Web-site <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proprietor</ENAMEX> has been more vociferous about the importance of
charging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> for content than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TheStreet</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James J. Cramer</ENAMEX>. "Our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">subscription</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is precisely why we have been so successful in getting ads
while others have failed miserably," he wrote in a clamorous essay titled
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wrong</ENAMEX>! Take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two</TIMEX>" for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TheStreet</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX> less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four months ago</TIMEX>.

            After making all that noise, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cramer</ENAMEX> softly announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TheStreet</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> is being split into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> financial advice sites--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> paid and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> free--and that one of the free <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> will be called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TheStreet</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. "Going
free for news is a must if we are to compete worldwide for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cramer</ENAMEX>
said in a press release. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Co-founder Marty Peretz</ENAMEX> and I welcome this plan as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to boost page views dramatically while growing additional revenue
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streams</ENAMEX>."

            If 
                  Slate
               's experience is any guide, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cramer</ENAMEX>'s hopes
of a big payoff from going free will be fulfilled. And, of course,

                  Slate
                also once was known for its noisy defense of the
notion of charging for content. But unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cramer</ENAMEX> (or so it seems to me),

                  Slate
                never claimed that the paying model was the only
true path and that anyone who disagreed was "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wrong</ENAMEX>!" Our position was, no one's
figured it out yet--we're trying this way. A diligent search for embarrassing
quotes found nothing better than a remark by 
                  Slate
               
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Kinsley</ENAMEX>, when we began charging in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, that this was our "fish
or cut bait" moment. And: "It's important to us to break even and to be a
business, not someone's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charity</ENAMEX> case." When we reversed course <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 months later</TIMEX>,
Kinsley was duly sheepish.

            But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cramer</ENAMEX> does not traffic in agnosticism or sheepishness. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Just four months</TIMEX>
ago in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wrong</ENAMEX>! Take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two</TIMEX>," he was calling free circulation proponents
"suicidalists," "deceivers," and "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fools</ENAMEX>" who "have their adherents even within
the walls of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TheStreet</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. It makes me livid. I regard these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">betrayers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scoundrels</ENAMEX> who would take the money we have all invested in
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TheStreet</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>] and throw it away."

            Relying on advertising to support content is hopeless, he wrote. "I can't
stress enough what a bust most advertising has been. The ad revenues are
totally <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemic</ENAMEX>. And they will stay that way for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> main reason: Most of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> is free. The vast majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> don't want to appear on free
sites. They don't trust them"

            Maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s announcement is part of an elaborate strategy whereby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cramer</ENAMEX>
will <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> split his Web sites like amoebas and set some of them free like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX>, always retaining some paid sites as starter dough for the next batch.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, it's a thicket of mixed metaphors, but it isn't the craziest revenue model
on the Web.
