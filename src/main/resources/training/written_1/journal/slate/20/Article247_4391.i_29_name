            I'm finding it a bit hard to locate my book in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>'s kickoff to this
discussion. Its argument is not, as he suggests, that "liberty converges onto
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anarchy</ENAMEX>." To the contrary: My argument is that a certain form of libertarianism
will lead to less liberty. A certain form of libertarianism--a knee jerk
libertarianism that looks at every proposed intervention by government and says
"leave the Net alone." My argument is that this response will lead to a Net
with far less liberty than the Net we know now, with a potential to be far more
regulated than any world we have known--ever.

            How?

            That's the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> part of the argument that seems to have gone missing: that
the liberty, or freedom, that cyberspace guarantees now is a function of the
architecture of that space. That that architecture--which I call "code,"
meaning the software and hardware that constitutes cyberspace as it is--was
initially an architecture that protected fundamental freedoms. But that that
architecture is changing. As it changes, the freedoms that the Net will
guarantee changes as well.

            How is it changing?

            This is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> part AWOL in this initial kickoff of a discussion. The
original architecture, given to us by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hackers</ENAMEX> and generally
libertarian sorts, is being changed as new layers of code are being added to
this architecture. And these new layers are being added not by the same
libertarian sorts who gave us the initial version of the Internet. They are
being added by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coders</ENAMEX> who work for commerce. The values implicit in their code
are different from the values implicit in the code of the original Internet.
And under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> story about how that code evolves, they threaten to flip the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the Net--from a place that protects liberty to a place where
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liberty</ENAMEX> has been coded away.

            Rather than focusing on those arguments, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX> wants to defend
"libertarianism"--a cause that he has admirably defended for a great deal of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Libertarianism</ENAMEX> is not, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX> says, quoting me, the view that
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>"; nor is it a focus on "reducing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s power."
That is "not the way in which a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">libertarian</ENAMEX> ... thinks about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>."
Rather, the libertarian "starts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of nature." His or her "objective
function starts with the goal of minimizing the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> and fraud in human
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. The hard part of the system is to figure out a way in which that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">minimization</ENAMEX> takes place over both public and private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX>."

            But there is "libertarianism" in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ivory Tower</ENAMEX> and there is
"libertarianism" on the ground. I recognize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX> describes;
I am a permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ivory Tower</ENAMEX>. But my book describes a present
political attitude, not the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ivory Tower</ENAMEX>. It is about a present political
reality, and a present rhetorical push. I am describing it because I have been
watching it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past six years</TIMEX>. In that world, if someone argued (as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX> does above) that a "law of privacy" was needed, as well as law
protecting trade secrets; that laws regulating libel and slander were
necessary, as well as a law regulating blackmail; if one even raised the issue
of taxation, or suggested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> was needed to "secure the
infrastructure", then one would not be a "libertarian." <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> would be a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Red</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">libertarian of the Net</ENAMEX> has a simple message, quite different from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory</ENAMEX> Tower
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Libertarianism</ENAMEX>. It is: Keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> out.

            Now of course this is an extreme, but the extreme affects the mean. And so
while there are few who would insist that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> always stay out, it
has become mainstream to argue that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> should just leave the Net
alone. "Let the Net take care of itself," is the slogan of our generation--and
the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. But if we do, then the Net will become something
very different from what it is just now.

            That's the argument of my book. Not an attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ivory Tower Libertarianism</ENAMEX>.
Nor even an attack on "sensible libertarianism." But an attack on a certain
do-nothingness that pervades our present political culture.

            So forgive me, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>, if I decline your sending it "over to" <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">me</ENAMEX> "to
explain why the same version of sensible libertarianism ... should not guide
our activities in cyberspace." That's the question of your many valuable and
important books. My book asks a different set of questions. Let me send it back
over to you to address some of them.
