                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX>'s note: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Weisberg</ENAMEX> has filed from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">night</ENAMEX>'s debate between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX>. Click here to read it.
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BEDFORD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.H.</ENAMEX>--I caught up with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, having not seen him
outside of his debates with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of months</TIMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of things
struck me about his appearance at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> forum for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> known as
a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Politics and Eggs Breakfast"</ENAMEX> (actually a quiche lunch with a commemorative
wooden egg laid at each place setting as a souvenir).

            The first thing I noticed was how much <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> has improved as a public
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>. Most of the time, in my experience, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> comes across more
eloquently on the printed page that in his own speaking voice, which has all
the effervescence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">day-old champagne</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it seemed just the reverse.
Comments that might read as platitudinous rang with quiet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> and sincerity.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> spoke for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nearly 45 minutes</TIMEX> and held the attention of a large, mostly
conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> throughout with a mixture of gentle humor, anecdote, and
explicit policy talk. Of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> has always been the opposite of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>
in that he radiates a sense of inner calm and comfort with who he is. What
seemed different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> was that he also seemed far more present and charismatic
than usual, as he hopped discursively from observations on globalization to
stories about his childhood in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> to jokes about <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> to his
substantive proposal of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, which was a plan to eliminate <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 billion</NUMEX> a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> in corporate tax subsidies.

            The other thing that struck me about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s performance was the somewhat
inconsistent quality of what one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> recently described as his streak of
"civic mysticism." There were points in the speech were I found myself entirely
swept up in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s call to political reengagement. In one particularly
strong riff, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> talked about the need to turn globalization and rising
prosperity into a more inclusive "narrative" in which ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can
locate themselves. Another fine bit was the meaty part of his speech in which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> talked about how the growth of the tax loopholes that he is proposing
to eliminate fosters a corrosive distrust of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. Still another was the
part about <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">race</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toni Morrison</ENAMEX> on her vision of a world
"in which race exists but doesn't matter."

            But at other times, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>-stirring rhetoric sounds pretty much like
hooey, as when he answered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> of his proposals to end child poverty and
extend health insurance to all by repeating the mantra that "in a world of new
possibilities guided by goodness, we can." Beware of policy proposals that
include a change in human nature as one of their essential requirements. There
was more of this kind of thing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s address on "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> in the New
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Millennium</ENAMEX>," which I read but did not hear him deliver. "Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say we
can never achieve our special destiny," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> concluded. "But I say, in a
world of new possibilities, guided by goodness, we can and we will."

            At the press conference, following <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX>'s speech, I couldn't resist
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">asking Bradley</ENAMEX> what that was supposed to mean. What is our "special destiny"
and who are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who say we can never achieve it? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> actually filled
out the clich√© rather convincingly. "I think that our special destiny is to
lead the world by the power of our example as a pluralistic democracy and a
growing economy and to do so in a way that is consistent with the promise of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Declaration</ENAMEX>," he said. And who disagrees with that view? "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> who get
caught up in the current moment and don't have a longer view of our history and
our potential," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> said. "I could put a number of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> in
there, but I decided not to do that."

            As I mentioned, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s serious policy proposal of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> was to save <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$125 billion</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next decade</TIMEX> by cutting corporate tax
subsidies and cracking down on tax shelters. This is a perfectly reasonable
idea, but it is undermined by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> big flaws. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flaw No. 1</ENAMEX> is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> wants
to crack down on tax subsidies for mining, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>, and grazing, but leaves
ethanol untouched. The reason is obvious--he's running in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> caucuses on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 24</TIMEX>. But the inconsistency glares. By proposing to cut off tax subsidies
only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that don't have early primaries, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> has actually undermined
his case for cutting any subsidies at all. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s new pro-ethanol position
means that instead of ending tax favoritism, he is merely trimming it in
politically convenient places.

            In answering a question about this, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> seemed to leave the door open to
changing his mind on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time, when he finished his answer by
saying, "There are many other things in the tax code that I might be
revisiting, so you don't know." But asked to clarify his position on the
matter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> said he would not "revisit" the tax subsidy for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flaw No. 2</ENAMEX> is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s loophole closing isn't politically astute
enough--in a way that the tax reform he accomplished in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> was. Tax reform in
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1980s</NUMEX> was a grand bargain--it eliminated tax favoritism for some in
exchange for lowering tax rates for all. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s latest proposal holds no
such broad-based appeal. To cut tax subsidies without reducing rates is a tax
increase. However defensible as a way to increase federal revenues, it has no
prayer of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> support.

            To my mind, this insufficient idea only raises the question of why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>
hasn't yet come up with a more ambitious tax-reform proposal. An offer to do
what he did in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> once again would command widespread support. It would shift
the debate with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subject</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> talks about with total confidence
and authority. And it would provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>, should he win the nomination, with
an answer to the non-reformist tax-cut plans emanating from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
side. Perhaps tax reform doesn't appeal to the new spiritualized side of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>. It's just good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> without any civic mysticism in it at
all.
