            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the more telling things about the complexity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX>'s acquisition of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> is the simple fact that no one seemed able to agree on just how
much the deal was worth. Consider:

            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, it was a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$166 billion</NUMEX> deal.

            I wrote <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that it was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$184 billion</NUMEX>.

            And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TheStreet</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> first said the deal was worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$125 billion</NUMEX> (go figure),
then came around and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the day</TIMEX> said it was worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$180 billion</NUMEX>.

            According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Post</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, it was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$173 billion</NUMEX>.

            But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> said, no, it was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$156.14 billion</NUMEX>. (You have
to love the "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.14</NUMEX>" part of that.)

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> thought it was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$165 billion</NUMEX>.

            Part of the confusion stems from the fact that it's an all-stock plus
debt-assumption deal, so that as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX>'s stock price fluctuates, so does the size
of the deal. But the confusion also stems from uncertainty about how many
shares <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> has outstanding, the lack of a collar, and a general
vagueness about how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> decided on how big the new company
would be.

            (The right way to calculate the deal's value, by the way, is to multiply the
price of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX>'s stock by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>, multiply that by the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> shares,
and add <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$17 billion</NUMEX>. I think.)

            The confusion isn't overwhelmingly important, of course. But the idea that
somehow it doesn't really make a difference whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> is paying <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$156</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$165</NUMEX>
billion for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> is wrong, and seems emblematic of the fawning embrace
of this deal by the press. (Though not by Wall Street.) Just because it's in
stock doesn't make it less real. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven billion</NUMEX> dollars in shareholder value is
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$11 billion</NUMEX>.
