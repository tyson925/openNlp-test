               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> leads with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s expected proposal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$280</NUMEX>
million increase in federal funds targeting the enforcement of current gun
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> laws, a move the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> says is explicitly calculated to meet a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recurring NRA</ENAMEX> criticism: that federal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">firearms</ENAMEX> prosecutions have steeply
declined under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> carries the gun
enforcement money inside, but joins the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times in leading with the abrupt postponement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> talks
that had been scheduled to resume in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>. Both papers
report that one factor was the publication in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> press last week of
the working paper for the talks, which displeased <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> by revealing some of
its heretofore unpublicized concessions, such as allowing some sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ground station</ENAMEX> to remain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Golan Heights</ENAMEX> and endorsing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassadors</ENAMEX> and the opening of borders. The story also sits atop
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> 's front-page news index box and
is fronted below the fold by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> , whose top non-local story is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>'s
new polling on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> primaries showing that both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">races</ENAMEX> are "up for grabs." Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> 's front-page
poll detects strong leads for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> caucuses.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> take on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> talks mentions a prosaic angle behind the sudden turn
of events: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasser Arafat</ENAMEX> is scheduled to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Syrians</ENAMEX> didn't much relish "languishing" down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> during those festivities.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> top-fronts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kofi Annan</ENAMEX>'s choice of former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> arms monitor
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rolf Ekeus</ENAMEX> to lead a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> that will attempt to complete the task
of assessing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX>, biological, and nuclear weapons capabilities of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> goes on to note that last night <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russia</ENAMEX>
registered its objection to the appointment, throwing it into doubt and
inducing tension between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> should have, like
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> does over its inside story on the matter, mentioned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
balk in the headline.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> reefers <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore-Bradley</ENAMEX> debate centering on racial
issues, while the others stuff it. The coverage notes that the only real harsh
disagreement between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> came on the question of police racial profiling.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> challenged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> to sign an executive order
banning the practice immediately and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> replied that he didn't think his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>
"needs a lecture from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX>." Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and LAT
top-front pictures of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 46,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marchers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S.C.</ENAMEX>, protesting the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">state</ENAMEX>'s practice of flying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Confederate</ENAMEX> battle flag on the state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Capitol</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> says the protest was perhaps the greatest civil rights rally
since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> and that it drew a surprisingly high number of white
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marchers</ENAMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5 percent to 10 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Papers</ENAMEX> doesn't
know what's more depressing--that the white turnout was so small or that it's
seen as so large. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> sees only a "smattering" of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> in
attendance.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> reports that a study to be released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> finds that while
the income gap between rich and poor widened in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> overall during the
'90s, the size of the gap depended on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in question. The average income
of the top <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$137,500</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10</NUMEX> times that of
the poorest <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX>, which was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$13,300</NUMEX>, but in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky</ENAMEX>--the top figure was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 11</NUMEX> times the bottom.

            A gap of another sort is detailed on the USAT front: The death rate
for liposuction is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> times to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> times higher than the death rate for all
operations performed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, according to a new study. The main reason
given by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is that liposuction is mostly performed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>,
where the procedures aren't required to be so strict. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> can't tell
if this is enough of an explanation, because the story doesn't say what the
overall mortality rate is for all in-office procedures.

            Look for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> to take a bit of a beating over a remark reported inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> . In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> said he'd served in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> with many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX>. When asked how he knew that
given that they hadn't come out to him, he responded, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Well</ENAMEX>, I think we know by
behavior and by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX>." He went on to say that he wouldn't "pursue" such
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sailors</ENAMEX>, meaning apparently that he wouldn't try to get them expelled from the
service. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> reports that an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Rights Campaign</ENAMEX>,
a major gay rights group, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>'s remark was "a form of prejudice." The
paper doesn't say it, but it's worth noting that if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> is right that gaydar
is pretty much universal, and suppressing awareness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> so as to
maintain cohesion is the point of "Don't Ask Don't Tell,"--a doctrine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>
supports--then well, the doctrine has no point, since everybody already knows
and hence unit cohesion is already threatened.
