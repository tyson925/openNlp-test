            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York</ENAMEX>
Times leads with predictions that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>'s popularity with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> will give him a distinct advantage there over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bill</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early March</TIMEX> primaries. The story ran off-lead in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early</TIMEX> edition,
swapping places with a lengthy piece on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Golan Heights</ENAMEX> who are
anxious about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX>'s possible return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> Redskins
capture the top <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> front but not a berth in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFC</ENAMEX>
championship game. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> off-leads a piece on presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>'
maneuverings before the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> caucuses (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 24</TIMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> primary
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 1</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times lead reports that more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> may be breaking the law
by firing or threatening illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. The trend is described as backlash to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> that have been aggressively recruiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to beef up their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> waits until the beginning of its jump to reveal the reason
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> holds an advantage over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> among black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>: he's riding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
coattails. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> enjoys great popularity among black political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX> for opening doors to political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appointments</ENAMEX>, affirmative action programs,
and other kinds of support. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> has ardently discussed the topic of
improving race relations, but has not been able to sway those content with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> policies and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">place</ENAMEX> near them. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> lands on the
LAT front, calling for better race relations and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lambasting</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> for failing to take a stand against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> for flying the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederate</ENAMEX> flag over its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">capitol</ENAMEX>. Both papers mention <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s speaking
appearance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Luther King Jr.</ENAMEX>'s old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s war <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chests</ENAMEX> seem to be giving them a boost in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>, and
both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> hope strong showings in the caucuses will boost their chances
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following week</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> reports. All the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>
campaigns--save <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX>'s, which has circumvented the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> from the word
go--are scrambling in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the final week</TIMEX> to set their expectations and resulting
strategy.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Employers</ENAMEX> have been cracking down on illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to deliver a blow to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> that have been recruiting and organizing these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, according to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> . An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</ENAMEX> policy released in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> protects all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, including those without papers, but a) employers
do not have to rehire illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, even if they were fired wrongly and b)
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> themselves are afraid to unionize, for fear of being fired or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deported</ENAMEX>.

            Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> front follow-ups to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL-Time Warner</ENAMEX>
merger. The split in shareholder ownership turned out to be the sticking point
in negotiations, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Levin</ENAMEX>
wouldn't make the deal unless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> granted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TW</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 percent</NUMEX> of the new
company (For a profile of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levin</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX>, see 
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>'s
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessment</ENAMEX>.) The
story follows the negotiations, occasionally lapsing into celebratory narration
("And so a pair of skilled corporate sherpas--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> representing each
side--started gearing up for the climb to the summit.") The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT Money</ENAMEX>
& Business section runs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> articles on the merger, including a mock
oration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levin</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> front-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pager</NUMEX> looks
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX>'s growth during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '90s</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>'s abortive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pathfinder</ENAMEX> Web site.
The piece, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Money & Business</ENAMEX> lead, points out that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> gave early legitimacy to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> when it sold the rights to post
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time magazine</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>. The old media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> decided not to pursue buying
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year later</TIMEX>, figuring that the free Web would chase away private online
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tigers</ENAMEX>, a paramilitary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> notorious for murdering
and/or terrorizing non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX>, was killed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zeljko Raznatovic</ENAMEX>, known
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arkan</ENAMEX>, was shot in one of his eyes at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intercontinental Hotel</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>' report. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yugoslav</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX>
might benefit most from his death, since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arkan</ENAMEX>--indicted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> on war crimes
charges--was thought to know a great deal about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>'s involvement in
"ethnic cleansing." Blame or credit?: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> reports that "no arrests
were made, as opposed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> , which runs inside a report filed from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, explaining that "no one claimed responsibility."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT Golan Heights</ENAMEX> story, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early edition</TIMEX> lead if there
ever was one, offers a glimpse at how <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> are coping with the
possibility that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> will return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> as part of a peace deal.
The biggest strategic loss would be <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Hermon</ENAMEX>, from which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX>
military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> out over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> escorts learn a lesson in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journalism</ENAMEX>: "After escorting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> to the off-limits peak <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>, the
army announced that the two dense clusters of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish-encrusted antennae</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buckminster Fuller</ENAMEX> radar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX> were off the record and should not be
mentioned."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Editorial Page</ENAMEX> runs an "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Editorial Notebook</ENAMEX>" called "Why
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">America Loves 'The Sopranos'</ENAMEX>," in the midst of a boundless media campaign
pushing the show. The last paragraph begins: "Of course, half the fun of
watching <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'The Sopranos</ENAMEX>' is watching a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that is really a paramilitary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>." Not only is the piece already a gush for the show, but--not to
be a party-pooper--the last paragraph seems somehow overblown after reading the
news accounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arkan</ENAMEX>'s slaying, since he headed what was really
"really a paramilitary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orgainzation</ENAMEX>."
