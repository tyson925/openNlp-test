               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> leads with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>'s unanimous decision holding that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> can prohibit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> from selling data it collects from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX>'
licenses and motor vehicle registrations. This paves the way, says the paper,
for tighter privacy laws governing personal financial, medical, and marketing
information. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> puts the decision atop its front-page
news box. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> goes
with another court ruling, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-4</ENAMEX> decision that fleeing from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> in a
high crime area provides the reasonable suspicion that justifies a
stop-and-frisk search. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> lead, coming in the wake of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">USAT</ENAMEX> lead claiming that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> would be asking for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>
to be broken in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is actually asking for it to be broken
into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>. But the story doesn't claim to know along what lines. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> notes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s chief resource is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, making relevant
the question, "Which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> would get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX>?" The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times leads local but with the sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> first that often
becomes a bellwether: Because diesel fumes are generally blamed for much of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk posed by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>' air pollution, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern California</ENAMEX> air
quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> plans to propose requiring all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car fleets</ENAMEX>
operated by public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to eventually be entirely composed of vehicles
running on electricity, natural gas, and other clean-burning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuels</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> reefers, by the way, an independent scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>'s finding
that global warming is "undoubtedly real" and accelerating.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> fronts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX>'s remarks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that only federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> have the authority to decide the disposition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Elián González</ENAMEX> case,
and not the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> who ruled that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> must remain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> until
an early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> hearing.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> reefers the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX>'s warning to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s flu-swamped <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> against relying too heavily on the two newest
anti-flu <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. The fear is that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> might die (and that some already
have) because they are being given these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> instead of antibiotics, and/or
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>, intravenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX>, and hospitalization.

            The WP fronts a sports exclusive: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jordan</ENAMEX> has been talking to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Wizards</ENAMEX>
about possibly becoming an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> and perhaps even taking on
an ownership stake.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> top-fronts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX>'s appearance <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Letterman</ENAMEX> show. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> calls the interview "fairly benign," and notes that
at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> credited <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudy Giuliani</ENAMEX> with having "done a lot of stuff as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> , in its inside effort, doesn't mention the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX>
comment. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> aced a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> quiz <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Letterman</ENAMEX>
served up, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> says that her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> suggested that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had been given "a sneak peek at the questions."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> fronts <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s recision of its ban of openly gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in its armed forces. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> notes this brings <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> into line with
the policy of almost all other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. Pop culture prediction: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> military clothing will become hot,
hot, hot on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Village</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Hollywood</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> reports inside that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> proposed new
tax credits for low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to convince them that even entry-level jobs
are preferable to welfare. The plan would be a further extension of the
earned-income tax credit, which already provides <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> payments to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 19</NUMEX>
million working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> at or near the poverty line. It's hard not to feel
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> doesn't get his due on this one. His expansion of this tax
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">credit</ENAMEX> is actually one of the most successful federal anti-poverty programs
ever, yet he hardly ever gets press credit for it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> article
runs on Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.

            The WP business section observes that due to a provision in the AOL
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX> stock plan, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> can be fully vested in their stock options one
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> after any change of ownership that leaves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> with less than
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. In other words, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> deal. Which
means, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> , that a year from now, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>
will get to cash in. Upshot: Housing prices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern Virginia</ENAMEX> will go
through the roof, and there will be a lot startups in the area, plus an influx
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">money managers</ENAMEX>, and ... <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>.

            The WSJ features an op-ed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Lewis</ENAMEX> wondering why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> would
want <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>. What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> has done, he writes, is lower its credit rating,
acquire <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> and movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> not particularly gifted
at making money, and transform itself from a sexy, fast-growing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> into a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dull</ENAMEX>, slow-moving one. He concludes that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years from now</TIMEX> an investment banker
will make a fortune breaking up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL Time Warner</ENAMEX> again and selling off the
pieces.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> business section piece claims that the deal leaves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America</ENAMEX>
with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> independent media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> (down from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Papers</ENAMEX>
thinks this cries out for a new parlor game: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> random media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> are
named and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contestants vie</ENAMEX> to connect them corporately in the fewest steps. Call
it "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Six Degrees</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Levin</ENAMEX>."
