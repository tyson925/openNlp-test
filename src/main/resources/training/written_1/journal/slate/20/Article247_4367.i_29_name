            Stuffed inside the shrink wrap alongside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscriber</ENAMEX> copy of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>'s Talk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> is a glossy new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benetton</ENAMEX> catalog titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"We</ENAMEX>, on
Death Row." This elegant advertorial product intersperses color photographs of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">death-row inmates</ENAMEX> with somber quotations about the evils of capital punishment
from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope John Paul II</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dalai Lama</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Luther King Jr.</ENAMEX>, and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">giants</ENAMEX> of the fashion industry. The mostly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-piece garments worn by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX>, which come in bright hues of yellow, blue, and (especially) red--to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> from the photos, red is the dominant color <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this season</TIMEX> on death row--are
not, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> presumes, actually available at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benetton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>. But
apparently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benetton</ENAMEX> hopes that some of the death-row <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX>' existential
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glamour</ENAMEX> ("They broke the rules. They defied the order," writes someone named
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Shulman</ENAMEX> in an introductory essay) will rub off on the retail clothing
chain. (To check out the abbreviated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benetton</ENAMEX>'s death-row

            According to a press release posted on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benetton</ENAMEX>'s home page,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benetton</ENAMEX> is launching a campaign that is

            

               
                  
                     about the death penalty [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">italics</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benetton</ENAMEX>'s; don't ask
Chatterbox what they mean] . Leaving aside any social, political, judicial or
moral consideration [!] , this project aims at showing to the public the
reality of capital punishment, so that no one around the world,
[ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ] will consider the death penalty neither [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ]
as [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ] a distant problem nor [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ] as
[ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ] news that occasionally appear [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ] on TV. ...
The campaign will appear on billboards and on the pages of the major news
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2000</TIMEX>. ... With this new
initiative, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benetton</ENAMEX> has once again chosen to look reality in the face by
tackling a social issue, as it did in previous campaigns that focused on war,
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Aids</ENAMEX>, discrimination and racism. Bitterly attacked by some and internationally
acclaimed by others, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benetton</ENAMEX>'s campaigns have managed to tear down the wall of
indifference contributing at [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ] raising the awareness of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">universal</ENAMEX> problems among world's [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>. At the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, they have paved the way for innovative modes of corporate
communication
                   [italics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX>'s] .
               

            

            Don't get Chatterbox wrong; like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benetton</ENAMEX>, he is opposed to capital
punishment. But its attempt to harness this principled stand to the selling of
high-necked mohair sweaters, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Peruvian</ENAMEX> folk ponchos, and lycra-lined lace
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">panties</ENAMEX> does tend to trivialize the issue (in much the same way that its
previous campaigns trivialized war, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, discrimination, and racism). The
catalog also objectifies real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Looking at the photos of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">murderers</ENAMEX>
awaiting execution, one feels invited to ask--are they human beings? Or are
they objets de couture ?

            No doubt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benetton</ENAMEX> would consider this characterization terribly unfair.
After all, it didn't just put together a bunch of photographs; it also hired
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Shulman</ENAMEX> ("a free-lance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> who works for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> ," according
to the Web press release) to conduct interviews with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX>. Here are some
of the questions <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shulman</ENAMEX> asked:

            

               
                  What does this place sound like at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>?
What did you think of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX>?
What's it like when you lose a person you've been close to?
What's wrong with the world <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>?
Do you think you're unlucky?
What is your favorite part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>?
Do you miss real <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>?
               

            

            Here are some questions <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shulman</ENAMEX> never asked (or, if he did, never
included in the final version):

            

               
                  Why did you kill that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>?
Would you be sorry you killed if you'd never been caught?
Can you imagine circumstances in which you'd kill again?
               

            

            According to a note at the end of the catalog, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> were not
permitted to speak about the crime, guilt or innocence, or prison conditions
unless specifically requested by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benetton</ENAMEX> might just as well
have added, "And we had no interest in discussing these crimes with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of the murder <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>." (The prison <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX> may be objectified, but
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> they killed don't seem to exist at all.) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> is especially
perplexed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benetton</ENAMEX>'s reluctance to investigate--even inquire about--the
guilt or innocence of these death-row <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX>. The judicial system's tendency
to mark the odd innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX> for death is, after all, one of the more powerful
arguments against capital punishment. At first, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> thought perhaps
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benetton</ENAMEX> didn't probe individual cases because it didn't want to demonstrate
that most death-row <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX> are indeed guilty. (Not even the most
bleeding-heart death-penalty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> would dispute that.) On reflection,
though, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benetton</ENAMEX>'s fear is more likely the opposite: It
doesn't want to find any innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. The point, after all, is
to be outré . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Killers</ENAMEX> are outré . Wrongly accused prison <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX>
are merely tragic. Imagine trying to sell a pair of shantung trousers with the
pitch, "It will make you look like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> !"
