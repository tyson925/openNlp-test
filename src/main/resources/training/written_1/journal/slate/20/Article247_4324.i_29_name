            Am I really supposed to crack wise after a week in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
percent, and so much money drained out of the stock market that it felt like,
well, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late November</TIMEX> all over again? Well, of course I am. It's like that great
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">comic Baudelaire</ENAMEX> said about the true ironist: You have to be "a disinterested
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectator</ENAMEX> of yourself," especially when your self is watching its nest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>
quickly dwindle to "what the hell, blow it all in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big bash!" proportions.
Of course, if you've been buying stocks on margin--and I know no regular
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moneybox</ENAMEX> would be doing that--things are much, much worse. Some of
those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are probably home right now getting the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lost in America</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Brooks</ENAMEX> lecture from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> and being informed that they are no
longer allowed to use the words "nest" or "egg" ever again, let alone sign on
to E*<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade</ENAMEX>.

            OK, things aren't as bad as all that, though after market close today
traditional tech stalwart <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucent</ENAMEX> pre-announced that its earnings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this quarter</TIMEX>
are going to fall well short of estimates, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> started dumping
high-priced stocks all over again. In any case, there's always <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>. And, if
you've been saying that this tech-stock boom couldn't continue forever, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glorious</ENAMEX> and perhaps unbeatable feeling of knowing that at last you were right.
So either way, eat, drink, and be merry. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX>'s still in office.

            On to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cocktail Chat</ENAMEX>!

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. "Before the end-of-the<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-day</TIMEX> sell-off, PC-maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gateway</ENAMEX>'s stock was
actually up on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, despite the fact that the previous <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> announced that it was going to miss estimates for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the quarter</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> apparently liked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s honesty about its performance.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEOs</ENAMEX> everywhere immediately started wondering if they should hold conference
calls explaining that their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX> had gone badly 'because I was spending a
lot of time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> working on my golf game.'"

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. "FreeMarkets, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the B2B</TIMEX> auction site that was a stock-market darling in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last few weeks of 1999</TIMEX>, saw its stock fall by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost a third</NUMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>
announced that it would be ending its relationship with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> in favor of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">competitor Commerce One</ENAMEX>. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had trumpeted its relationship
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>, it quickly came out with a press release pointing out that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>
represented <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 10 percent</NUMEX> of its business . 'It's only the largest
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">automaker</ENAMEX> in the world,' the release did not add.'"

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. "If you can keep your head while all those around are losing
theirs . ... What goes up must come down. ... Buy on the dip . ... The
fire exits are located in the front of the auditorium. Run."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> announced that its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> revenue would be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$650</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX> , up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">170 percent</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, and more than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> made in
all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. Of course, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> also announced that it would lose lots
of money in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> . Shocked, shocked I am!"

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. "In a short item on a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airline</ENAMEX> offering high-priced service
using corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jets</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airline</ENAMEX>'s perks
include 'a large work surface, gourmet buffet, and spirits .' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Spirits</ENAMEX>?
What is this, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX>? Will the stewardesses be wearing go-go <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">boots?</ENAMEX>"

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. "Just before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucent</ENAMEX> announced that it would miss estimates in the
latest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lehman Brothers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> came out and boosted his price
target on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. Ah, finally. A case where there really was no
selective disclosure."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. "Online investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guru</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tokyo Joe</ENAMEX> was sued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> in a civil
fraud case. Among the allegations is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo Joe</ENAMEX>--listen, he calls himself
that-- duped <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> to his e-mail advisory , exaggerating his annual
returns by leaving out losing trades. ... Wait a minute. Are you actually
supposed to keep track of the trades where you don't make money?"
