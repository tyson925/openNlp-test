            During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past five years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> across the planet
spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $200 billion and $500 billion</NUMEX> fixing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y2K</ENAMEX> computer bug. Was
this money spent in vain?

            Because no major Y2K incidents occurred, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skeptics</ENAMEX> charge
that it was. They suggest that the few minor glitches--such as the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$91,000</NUMEX> late
fee on a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s video rental--were easily corrected without spending
billions. And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paraguay</ENAMEX>, which spent little on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y2K</TIMEX>,
appear to have fared as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, which spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100 billion</NUMEX>. 


            However, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> is still out, the emerging
consensus of computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> is that the expenditures were worthwhile. Here's
their reasoning:

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.   A lack of preparation would have cost more. If "critical"
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>--such as power grids, defense computers, and hospital equipment--had
not been fixed, disaster might have followed. To prove this thesis, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> state
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> no Y2K fixes to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of its computers. The machines shut down when
they encountered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 1, 2000</TIMEX>. Even in non-critical systems, fixing errors
after the fact would have been expensive. For example, the cost of correcting a
couple thousand incorrect bills at a video <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> would far outweigh the cost of
prevention. And many computer system <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> liken <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y2K</ENAMEX> preparation to auto
insurance: Just because you didn't have a car accident <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, it doesn't
mean your insurance payments were a waste.

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.   <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Countries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> spent money in proportion to their reliance on
computers. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paraguay</ENAMEX> got away with spending less because they had
fewer machines to fix: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paraguay</ENAMEX>'s water and electric systems are largely
manual; its capital <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has only one phone line per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>,
smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> avoided major Y2K expense because they were less likely than
large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> to have mainframe computers running outdated code.

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The Y2K</TIMEX> spending will have other positive results. Many companies
solved their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y2K</NUMEX> problems by buying and installing new equipment and software.
Some of these upgrades would have been warranted, regardless of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y2K</TIMEX>. Other
upgrades will yield long-term benefits through improved computer
infrastructure. And in the developing world, the technology upgrades provided
"a vital advance into the computer age," according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> .

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.   Problems could still occur. Significant Y2K disruptions
may appear well into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the new year</TIMEX>. Many errors won't be revealed until software
processes data, which could be as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late as the next quarterly</TIMEX> billing cycle.
Also, some computers don't recognize <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> as a leap year, which means <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 29</TIMEX>
could bring new problems.
