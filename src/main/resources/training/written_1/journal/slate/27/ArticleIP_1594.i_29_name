<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Late</TIMEX> , produced for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ansell Inc.</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Eppley</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Red Bank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.J.</ENAMEX>

            
               One <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Night Stand, Two</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Weeks Later</TIMEX> , produced for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ansell Inc.</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stu Pollard</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>.

            
               Forget Me Not ,
produced for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ansell Inc.</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Starbuck</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Barbara</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX>

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Each year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ansell Inc.</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">LifeStyles condoms</ENAMEX>, conducts a condom ad contest that anyone can
enter--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> or individual, amateur or professional. Then the company
broadcasts the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">winners</ENAMEX> as its television advertising campaign, or tries to air
the ads themselves. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTV</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comedy Channel</ENAMEX> routinely run the spots, but
most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network affiliates</ENAMEX> outside <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> markets (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chico</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX>) have refused so far to show them.

            Under federal law,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broadcasters</ENAMEX> can't censor ads for political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, but everything
else--from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soap</ENAMEX> to the nuttiest issue ad campaign--must meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>'
amorphous standards of accuracy and good taste. So most of the ads you see on
television, believe it or not, are certified as true, defensible, and tasteful.
Presumably the condom ads aren't false--the product does work; they fail on
grounds of taste.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-prize
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Before It's Too Late</ENAMEX> , was created by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> whose hobby
is computer animation. A talking skeleton holding a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">LifeStyles condom</ENAMEX> in bony
fingers confides that he never used a condom because he was "too embarrassed to
ask for them from behind the counter," and because he'd "feel awkward stopping
in the middle of everything just to put this on." He continues: "But then
lately, I don't feel a thing."

            Even before the advent of
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, sex was equated with death. Before It's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Too Late updates and</ENAMEX>
exploits this cultural assumption, letting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX> play with the horror of
sex and death without really confronting it. The words aren't explicit, but the
message is: "Use a condom, and you won't die."

            "Don't be a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BoneHead</ENAMEX>," puns
the chyron at the end of the spot, humorously encouraging its target market to
reach for a condom. It conveys the sense that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">LifeStyles condoms</ENAMEX> must be a
reliable product, maybe even the best of condoms, because its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> care
enough about your health to advertise it that way. We share your fear, the ad
implies. Trust us to protect you from it.

            The second-place ad-- One
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Night Stand</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two Weeks Later</TIMEX> --evokes a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1940s</TIMEX> black-and-white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>
melodrama about the wages of illicit love. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine punishes</ENAMEX> herself because
she yielded to temptation, a temptation that was probably more alluring in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1980s</TIMEX> than it is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. She meets her "out of town" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> and takes him
back to her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>. "I woke up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next morning</TIMEX> and he was gone," she says,
her voice cracking with emotion. "I spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two weeks</TIMEX> worrying that I
might be pregnant, or I might have"--her voice trails off--"I don't even want
to think about it."

            The spot is aimed at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, the secondary consumer of condoms, reminding her that an alternative to
"no" is "wait a minute," followed by a quick dip into her nightstand drawer for
a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rubber</ENAMEX>.

            Speaking of drawers: The
third-place finisher, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Forget Me Not</ENAMEX> , features an animated condom in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drawer</ENAMEX>. Lonely and anxious to be used, the condom grows so weary of the wait
that he throws away his watch: Either the condom's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> is abstinent, or he's
careless. Sad organ music is suddenly replaced by an upbeat, jazzy score: The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> opens the drawer and takes the package. Virtually without narration, the
spot ends with a row of condom packages morphing into the name of the
product.

            This spot is more likely to
raise the hackles of the pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> than some of the others. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, the
product--and all that it connotes--is visible. And the computer animation and
cheerful music suggest that sex is a fun consumable. The spot does leave the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX> wondering about the rest of the story, and what tale the condom could
tell.

            What's
next? A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">LifeStyles</ENAMEX> ad for extra-large condoms? Wouldn't that move condoms!
Maybe it would. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1994</ENAMEX> debut of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s television ad campaign,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LifeStyles</ENAMEX> has become the fastest growing brand.
