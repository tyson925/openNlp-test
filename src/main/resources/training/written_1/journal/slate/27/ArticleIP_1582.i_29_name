               Valedictorian ,
produced for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram Americas</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valedictorian</ENAMEX> is more
than an appeal to the thirsty to drink <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crown Royal</ENAMEX>. It is the first break in
the liquor industry's self-imposed ban on hard-liquor advertisements on
television. The purveyors of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spirits</ENAMEX> complain that the decades-old ban doesn't
apply to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, and cite this as the reason why <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX> and hops have
been gaining market share against the hard stuff. Industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategists</ENAMEX> knew
that the ads were bound to be controversial; the initial spots, therefore, are
designed to slip the product into the commercial dialogue with minimal splash.
No happy groups hoisting highballs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Polo Lounge</ENAMEX> here; no scenes from the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>--or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX>--of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crown Royal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">roses</ENAMEX>. The spot is a little like the
negative ads fielded early in a political campaign: If you can get them by
without being too offensive, almost without being spotted, the message goes
down a lot more smoothly.

            Using metaphor to make its
point, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valedictorian</ENAMEX> clearly targets the male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX>. We see a large,
obviously well-trained vizsla (if it wasn't well trained, who would want to be
near it?) bringing <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> up the steps. The scene evokes the
gracious life, even if it doesn't quite translate to the real world: As dog
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> know, the family pet--if it fetches the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>--is as likely to shred
it as to deliver it. The setting is obviously upscale, and so is the reading
matter--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> . The music is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elgar's Pomp</ENAMEX> and
Circumstance ; the vizsla, the spare narrative tells us, is an
"obedience-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX>."

            We next see an identical
vizsla bringing in a velvet-pouched bottle of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crown Royal</ENAMEX>. (Or, is it the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>, doing double duty with the help of editing techniques that make it look
like the twin of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>--a commercial takeoff on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Multiplicity</ENAMEX> , which
brought multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Keatons</ENAMEX> to the screen?) This <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> is not just a
graduate, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> and chyrons tell us; it is the "valedictorian": a clear
invitation to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX> to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crown Royal</ENAMEX>, too, as being at the top of the
heap. If the class of canine brings a sense of nobility to the ad and product,
this particular specimen is so well trained that it intensifies the image of
controlled elegance, of comfort--an almost royal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> striding through a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">minimalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. Perhaps, echoes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elgar</ENAMEX>'s very similar Coronation
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> whisper across our minds. This is all a postmodern variation on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blend</ENAMEX>'s brand name. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> deploy the images to persuade the well-off
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">upwardly mobile</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crown Royal</ENAMEX> should be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chablis</ENAMEX> or chardonnay of
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>. Real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, the message here has it, don't drink <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>--any more
than they would own a poodle; and upscale <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> can do better than a beer and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutt</ENAMEX>.

            Thus the ad hits its
target--but it never attempts to tell us why <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crown Royal</ENAMEX> hits the spot. The
appeal is to a different kind of taste.

            We get a brief glimpse of a
dark glowing warmth in cut glass as the pouch falls away, much as a shift might
fall from the shoulders of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Valedictorian</ENAMEX> floats
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subliminal</ENAMEX> notes like this one, but uses few words--only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>, compared with
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> or more in the usual <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-second</TIMEX> spot. This ad is almost a nonpolitical
bumper sticker, a simple image designed to give a familiar name fresh life.

            Finally, we see the two
vizslas, waiting for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX>'s choice: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crown Royal</ENAMEX>, ready to be consumed
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> . The unanswered question, of course, is this: Has the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> waited <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> to fetch the paper, or is its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> about to have the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> drink of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> sometime in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>?

            On the surface,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valedictorian</ENAMEX> is innocuous. The aristocratic hounds grab our attention,
and the ad reaches for those who are in charge--of their world, their careers,
their money, and their vizslas--the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who are in control of their
drinking. Or so the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> would like us to think. But this won't placate the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> advertising, who charge that the underlying purpose of the
ad campaign is to recruit new drinkers, especially among the young. Almost
ritually, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> will reply that the campaign aims merely to compete for
market share among those who already drink. This spot has provoked calls for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to enact a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Prohibition</ENAMEX>--not on drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, but on marketing it in this way. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the first hard-liquor ads we see
on television, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valedictorian</ENAMEX> may be one of the last.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagrams</ENAMEX> also control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Studios</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX>. Just as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">101 Dalmatians</ENAMEX> is coming to neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crown Royal</ENAMEX>'s twin
vizslas are coming into your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Man</ENAMEX>'s best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, the ad seems to tell the
best of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, is telling us that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crown Royal</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s best drink.
