on "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Interncourse</ENAMEX>" (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> sex-and-perjury scandal ): <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> pal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vernon Jordan</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX> had told him she had never had an
affair with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> also denied he had told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> to falsely deny
having carried on such an affair. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>'s deposition about her relations
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has been postponed. Before the delay, reports said she would take
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth Amendment</ENAMEX>. Now she's said to be interested in negotiating for
immunity from prosecution for perjury and obstruction of justice (i.e., she
still might testify against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>) but negotiations have stalled. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)
Circumstantial evidence may corroborate her story, e.g., messenger receipts
allegedly for gifts between her and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> logs, and records of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s voice allegedly on her answering machine. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prosecutors</ENAMEX> have
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subpoenaed Betty Currie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX>, to seek further
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corroboration</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> reportedly admitted in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paula Jones</ENAMEX> deposition
(see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/19</NUMEX> item, below) that he fooled around with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gennifer Flowers</ENAMEX>. Naive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> concluded that this means <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> lied in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> when he denied having
had an affair with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flowers</ENAMEX>. Sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> conceded he can square his
various statements because he's a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">wizard with weasel</ENAMEX> words. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paula Jones</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> reportedly are investigating whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had an affair with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX> of the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ambassador</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Lawrence</ENAMEX>, who got into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington Cemetery</ENAMEX>
evidently because his fake military record wasn't carefully scrutinized. (For

               Pope
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Paul II</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel Castro</ENAMEX> portrayed him as a fan

agreeing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> should change the embargo policy, the pope
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blasted Castro</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) tolerating abortions and divorces; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
usurping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' authority to direct their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s education; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)
substituting "ideology" for Christianity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>'s spin: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX>'s
visit crowns freedom's triumph over communism and "is bound to hasten" <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>'s
progress toward democracy. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> spin: After the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX> leaves, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> will

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaczynski</ENAMEX> confessed that he is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unabomber</ENAMEX>, pleaded guilty to all
charges , and renounced his right to appeal rulings in his trial in exchange
for a sentence of life in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> without parole. He bought the deal because the
case against him was a "slam dunk," and he might have got the death penalty.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prosecutors</ENAMEX> bought the deal because <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Kaczynski's schizophrenia</ENAMEX> diagnosis made a
death sentence unlikely. Celebrity-trial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> reacted with dismay to the
abrupt end of the trial they had regarded as their next meal ticket.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Netanyahu</ENAMEX> 
               met privately with 
               evangelical
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> , many of whom oppose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. He also attended
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rally</ENAMEX> at which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Falwell</ENAMEX>, whose TV show has promoted a video implicating
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> in murders, spoke. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> in the meeting that he would
mobilize evangelical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> against those who put pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> to give
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Bank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cynics</ENAMEX> called it a payback for

reportedly was furious but told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> they should put past snubs behind

            Cloning
news: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> announced that they have engineered the births of
two 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cloned calves</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX>. The spin: It's a
commercial rather than a scientific advance, suggesting that the agriculture
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">industries</ENAMEX> are capitalizing quickly on cloning technology. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drug Administration</ENAMEX> claimed it has the authority to regulate human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cloning</ENAMEX>.
This has led to a dispute between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> who want to ban human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cloning</ENAMEX> and
biotechnology-industry groups, which think cloning regulation should be left to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1/21</NUMEX>)

"keen to visit this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>." Anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> heaped scorn on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> for succumbing to the woolly headed notion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> are

            Pope
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Paul II</ENAMEX> picked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinals</ENAMEX> . He has now picked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">106</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">123</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinals</ENAMEX> who will elect the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> agreed that by stacking this

them, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for the papacy will have to be more sensitive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>

from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Carville</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> is a puppet of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">greedy right-wingers</ENAMEX>, and besides,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is whipping her in the polls. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> spin: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Testifying</ENAMEX> in
