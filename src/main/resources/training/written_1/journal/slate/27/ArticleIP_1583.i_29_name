               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angel</ENAMEX> , produced for

            "Tears such
as angels weep ..."

            The angel weeps as the spot
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">opens</ENAMEX>, tears of rain apparently coursing down a soft-featured face. There is a
reflection in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, a rumble of thunder, a sense of beauty and menace,
which the music amplifies. But there are no words. The images become all the
more powerful as the dappling of the water slows and the rain seems to
stop.

            Seldom in a political spot
would we experience so wordless a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">span</ENAMEX>. Survey research urges ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> to use
every instant for explicit argument--even so, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 seconds</TIMEX> is never enough time
to convey all that needs to be conveyed.

            Relieved of those
constraints in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Angel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter Eskew</ENAMEX>, who produced spots for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">campaign</ENAMEX>, has sculpted a decidedly nonpolitical spot that evinces
clearly his sense of relief at having to make <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> powerful point. The
screen isn't cluttered with chyrons, comparisons, and third-party
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">verifiers</ENAMEX>.

            The very wordlessness of the
opening draws us in: What is this, we wonder, and what will happen next? The
visual transition--water spraying in a fountain, through which we now watch a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> playing with a toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sailboat</ENAMEX>--brings us to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> words: "You've
thought about it." Indeed we have--at least for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last few seconds</TIMEX>--and now,
the image seems almost the dreamlike product of our own minds. We see a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three decades ago</TIMEX>, it would have been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX>'s worried tone fits this setting of a stone angel intimating
mortality: "What would happen if you weren't here?"

            At this point, the picture
shifts to the angel (tombstone or promise of heaven?), and the spot brings us
back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> with an explicit, decidedly unethereal question about "money" and
where it would come from. Each successive question seems to echo the ones
forming in our minds. The one-time political ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX> is playing to a different
kind of responsive chord, appealing to a different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> value.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> touches the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s hand, and then, as the words invite us to wonder what would happen if
she were gone, she apparently is. Through the splashing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, across the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">angel</ENAMEX>'s wing, we think we see the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> alone, until the mother steps clearly
back into the picture. The narration gives the answer. Something needs to be
there--to step in--if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> is ever finally gone: "life insurance."
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX> insurance" doesn't sound crass because the context itself implies not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">self-interest</ENAMEX>, but a sense of caring literally beyond self-existence. The child
takes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> head homeward. The sky is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cloudy;</ENAMEX> is the storm returning? They walk hand in hand down the path as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">narrator</ENAMEX> tells us, in effect, that if another storm comes--the storm of
death--life insurance should be there, "not for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who die, [but] for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who live."

            The
subject is inherently unsettling. Death and life insurance are not the stuff
that daydreams are made of. But this spot is visually arresting, involving, and
dramatic. We want to see it again. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, we are left with the sense that
whatever angels we may go to when we depart, life insurance is the guardian
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">angel</ENAMEX> we should leave behind. The strength of the spot is that the fabric of
its images converts the actuarial into the nearly spiritual, and raises
numbers--money--to the level of moral values.
