               Pledge , produced by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Sipple</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Century Media Group</ENAMEX>

            With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> far behind, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> are replaying their comeback strategy of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>: taxes and
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>"--<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie Horton</ENAMEX>. In this well-produced spot, the
intentionally quiet images never get in the way of the message. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Made by Don</ENAMEX>
Sipple, the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maestro</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, the spot conforms to the letter
of the campaign laws, which now count <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> as out of money. The ad is presented
(<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just barely</TIMEX>) as legislative advocacy for (just nominally) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Committee</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> play the same game.

            The spot begins with
footage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> that was originally in color. As usual, the ad turns it
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">black</ENAMEX> and white--not only so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> won't look too good, but to create
the documentary quality of an old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">newsreel</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> looks and
sounds so sincere pledging not to "raise taxes on the middle class"--to provide
"tax relief no matter what we do." We can almost see him biting his lip. This
scene is designed to exploit popular attitudes looked for, and found, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>
polls: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s skepticism about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s honesty, as well as their belief
that their taxes have been raised. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> nearly always believe their taxes
have been raised--even when their taxes have been cut.

            The spot purports to
detail the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> tax increase--with a newspaper headline. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conveniently</ENAMEX>, this
"third-party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">verifier</ENAMEX>," the reliably conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Times</ENAMEX>, is
never identified. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> campaign disputes the charge of "the largest tax
increase in history." But the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> offer it without fear of refutation,
both because <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Patrick Moynihan</ENAMEX> said it and because it's
not much of a defense to reply that it's only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest tax increase.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unwisely</ENAMEX> argued with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kennedy</ENAMEX> over exactly how many
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of hungry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> there were in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> how the still
photos modestly complement, but never distract from, the series of charges--an
income-tax form is the visual for "higher income taxes," an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> the
visual for "increased taxes on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>," and so on. The series
culminates with a generic photo from a backyard barbecue and text that alleges
that the "typical" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> pays "<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,583</NUMEX>" more in taxes. The number acquires
credibility from its very specificity: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,583</NUMEX> is more authoritative than the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">narrator</ENAMEX>'s rounded-off <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,600</NUMEX>. And what is a "typical" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>? Almost all of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s tax increase hit high-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. If you pay a dollar and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buffet</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> pays <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 million</NUMEX>, has the "typical" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500,000.50</NUMEX>?
Technically, yes.

            Technical truths are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staples</ENAMEX> of political advertising. So is stamping a negative description, in
condemnatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">scarlet</ENAMEX> letters, across an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX>'s picture: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Broken Promises</ENAMEX>"
on taxes.

            Note the difference
between the narration and the words written across the screen at the end. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">narrator</ENAMEX> makes a campaign appeal, associating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> with higher taxes and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">waste</ENAMEX>. The screen, to satisfy the law, concludes with a dash of legislative
advocacy: Don't "veto" <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> tax cuts--which, of course, don't even exist
yet.
