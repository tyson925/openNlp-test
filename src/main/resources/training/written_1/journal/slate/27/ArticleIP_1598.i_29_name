               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX> , produced by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leo Burnett Co. Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX>

            
               Office opens in a
very proper, high-ceilinged office space. Its rows of well-ordered desks--far
from the power and privilege of a private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>--evoke the worst fears about
the dehumanizing places where corporate careers begin.

            Then we hear the whoosh of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cap</ENAMEX> turning on a bottle of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Diet Coke</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> opening the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda</ENAMEX> (dressed in a
white shirt and tie--at least you can take your jacket off at your desk) has
broken not only the silence but also the rules.

            Heads turn at other desks as
big-band music strikes up and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Diet Coke</ENAMEX> drinker spins away in his desk
chair. Suddenly decked out in a snazzy blue suit, he starts dancing
acrobatically, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Astaire</ENAMEX>-style, and singing the soda's theme, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX>-style
("just for the feel of it" updates the long-running "just for the taste of it"
theme of previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Diet Coke</ENAMEX> campaigns). The lighting changes, too, making the
office space look like the inside of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclub</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diet Coke</ENAMEX> takes you off the
beaten career track, the spot suggests. It liberates the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebel</ENAMEX> who's
doing what he has to do to get ahead, but who still doesn't take it all too
seriously.

            We've seen these visuals
before. It's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Martin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pennies From Heaven</ENAMEX> . Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> is being
transported to a different astral <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Diet Coke</ENAMEX>. He
dances off the walls and over to the desks of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, who smile up at
him--they've caught the mood. This is the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who gets the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>. We
know that for sure as he turns toward one of them, strokes her chin, and hands
her the bottle. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> tells us that "everyone is singing to the sound of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Diet Coke</ENAMEX>," and invites us to win CDs and trips to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grammies</ENAMEX> by checking the
bottom of the bottle cap. (The fine print about a "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-in-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>" chance
acknowledges regulations about truth in advertising: Even a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebel</ENAMEX> has to
conform to some rules.)

            After the bottle cap flips
off, revealing "YOU WIN," we cut to the latest in audio gear--and to one of the
office <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> dressed up for a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. She dances and dips with our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guy</ENAMEX> as he sings, "My place or yours." On his knees, he offers a rose to yet
another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>--and the spot cuts back to normal. The lighting is
fluorescent-bright as the bald <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> looks out of his private-office door. (This
is who our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> wants to become but is desperately afraid of becoming.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>
has heard something, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> looks as bland as usual. Was it just the
whoosh of the cap turning that disturbed the silence of this cathedral of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commerce</ENAMEX>? Or was it all a dream?

            As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> closes his door,
the on-screen chyron reads: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Diet Coke</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uncapped</ENAMEX>. Just for the sound of it."
"Uncapped" is a direct reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTV</ENAMEX>'s popular "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Unplugged</ENAMEX>" series, in which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electrified rockers</ENAMEX> strip down to acoustic to reach the essence of their music.
Getting uncapped with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Diet Coke</ENAMEX> presumably allows office workers a similar shot
at authenticity. And the chance of winning a trip to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grammies</ENAMEX> is more than
a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prize</ENAMEX>. It signifies that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Diet Coke</ENAMEX> is a with-it product that evokes the inner
music of youth, of being yourself wherever you are. Lest anyone miss this
point, when the bald <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> shuts his door, our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> (off-screen) sings: "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> more
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>!"

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diet Coke</ENAMEX>
may be a low-calorie <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX>, but its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> have never marketed it as a beverage
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX>. You're supposed to drink <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Diet Coke</ENAMEX> because you like it, not
because you have to drink it. You're a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebel</ENAMEX> who refuses to leave your youth
behind. You drank <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Diet Coke</ENAMEX> before you got to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, and while the bald
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guy</ENAMEX> can order you around, he can't take your soda away from you.
