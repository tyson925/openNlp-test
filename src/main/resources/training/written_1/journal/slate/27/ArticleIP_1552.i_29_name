<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> straight <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky Derby</ENAMEX> and the Preakness
fell just short in the final leg of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triple Crown</ENAMEX>. (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>'s near-winner

race outright, because if they'd won, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Real Quiet</ENAMEX> would have been disqualified
for interfering with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victory Gallop</ENAMEX>'s run--and they'd be remembered for
scandal, not just defeat. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6/8/98</NUMEX>)

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> bombing. The dramatic spin: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> testified
about their grief and received justice. The intellectual spin: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matsch</ENAMEX> sent a message against terrorism and in support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matsch</ENAMEX> argued that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> who were killed had been establishing justice,
ensuring domestic tranquility, and promoting the general welfare. His sound

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">administrators</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Opponents</ENAMEX> argued that religious-minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and school
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">administrators</ENAMEX> should be protected from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. The naive spin: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>
lost. The sophisticated spin: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> won, by appeasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> who will reward them at the polls in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>.

he had been fired. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ginsburg</ENAMEX>, they're willing to make nice with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX> in order to avert an indictment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pundits</ENAMEX> hope the
