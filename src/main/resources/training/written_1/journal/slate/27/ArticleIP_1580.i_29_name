               Nobody , produced by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Squier</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Squier</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knapp & Ochs</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">campaign</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title</ENAMEX> demonstrates
how far the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> campaign has come: In the wake of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> election,
who could have imagined a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> commercial in which a tracking shot of
the empty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oval Office</ENAMEX> is paired with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> asking who really belongs
there? The answer, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, would have been Anyone But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>.

            A negative spot that touches
on many issues, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Title</ENAMEX> casts the attack in a seemingly high-minded
context by imagining <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mahogany</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s desk. To make
certain that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX> catches the negative ad's drift, double-exposed over
the scene is a shot of a pallid, black-and-white <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> and a grimacing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX>.

            And once again, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> tax
cut is attacked without being called a tax cut. (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tax</ENAMEX> cuts are too popular to
attack.) Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 percent</NUMEX> tax cut is a "risky <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$550 billion</NUMEX> plan."
This description makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>'s proposal sound more like an old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>'
big-spending program than a tax cut.

            Recycling phrases and images
from earlier ads, the spot moves at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">light</NUMEX> speed from campaign issue to campaign
issue: deficits, education, and drug cuts, abortion, interest rates, and harm
to the economy. Meanwhile, double-exposed images of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, and the
signs (literally) of a failing economy fill the screen, all punctuated by the
grim visage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX>. (Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> wonder if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s spots pack in too
many poll-driven buzz words for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> to absorb.)

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title</ENAMEX> asks, Where do
you stand? Do you want <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oval Office</ENAMEX>? This is the post-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX>
equivalent of asking whose finger you want on the nuclear button. With a swift
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pivot</ENAMEX>, the spot supplies its own answer as a smiling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> is captured
striding down a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> passageway toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oval Office</ENAMEX>, where he
presumably belongs. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title</ENAMEX>-- surely <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Morris</ENAMEX>' last contribution to the
campaign--presents <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> as both a budget balancer and as a tax cutter. As in
an earlier
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> spot, tax cuts are associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and never with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>.

            The spot ends with a dash of
triangulation: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> must defeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gingrich Congress</ENAMEX> at bay, a
bit of demonization that may help congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>. The tracking shot of
the empty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oval Office</ENAMEX> is reprised, and the spot states that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> must decide
whether it will be occupied by the presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> or the throwback
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>.

            Make sure
to read the credits, which research shows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> rarely do. This is the last
ad of "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton/Gore Primary Campaign</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> ran out of primary money months
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX> and now, as the general election begins, both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> are on equal
financial footing. Stay tuned to see what they're trying to do to your
heads.
