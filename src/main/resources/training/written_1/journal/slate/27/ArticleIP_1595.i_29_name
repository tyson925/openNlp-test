               Woodchuck , produced
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energizer Batteries</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBWA Chiat/Day</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Epoch Films</ENAMEX>.

            Political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pollsters</ENAMEX> argue
that most commercials don't really work--that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX> recall of a product and
its claimed attributes is actually remarkably low, and that the research
"proving" the efficacy of the ads is largely controlled by the ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that
made the ads in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place. (That's mild, by the way, compared with what
the commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> say about the quality and ethics of political
ads.)

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Energizer Bunny</ENAMEX> is an
exception to this rule. Batteries are practically a commodity, but the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">long-running Bunny</ENAMEX> campaign has implanted the message of long-lasting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliability</ENAMEX> in the public consciousness. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Bunny</ENAMEX> is now almost a cultural
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">artifact</ENAMEX>, and if the "keeps going and going" message is to be extended, it must
be restated in ways that build on the image without boring the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woodchuck</ENAMEX> is a case
study of the process--and a case of cultural updating. In a series of quick
cuts--narrative bites that put old slogans into younger voices and visual
echoes of popular entertainment--the spot extends the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energizer</ENAMEX> message to a
new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>.

            As the camera pulls back
from a television set showing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Energizer Bunny</ENAMEX> in action, we see a group of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twentysomething</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX>--in T-shirts, shorts, chinos, with an occasional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beard</ENAMEX>--gathered around a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> or a utility <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of them talks about how
long "this thing's been goin', " and the "obsession" to chase it. (Where are
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>: Don't they buy batteries?) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> piles in and sets off down the
road while the rotating radar on top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> searches out its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>--like a
scene out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twister</ENAMEX> . Like the storm-chasers, we're told, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> has
"gone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> without seeing anything." Here and later, the borrowed images from
Twister are amplified by the searchers talking not to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX>, but
to what appears to be a third-party documentary filmmaker. The absence of music
adds to the documentary feel.

            Staring through binoculars,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the searchers expresses the frustration inherent in any search for a
not-so-Holy Grail--whether it's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elvis</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">UFO</ENAMEX>, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Energizer Bunny</ENAMEX>: "It's
toying with us again." Next we encounter an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-Files moment--a blurry
black-and-white photo that's even less distinct than the ones of flying saucers
that are the talismans of an entire subculture. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">searcher</ENAMEX> insists that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photo</ENAMEX> is real, that it is proof: "Right there you can see its ears and its
drum."

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Come on</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>!" <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">searchers</ENAMEX> is in a field, trying to capture an undeniable video of the rabbit.
It's reminiscent of the storm-chasers who miss the twister because they go
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">north</ENAMEX> instead of south. The next scene is a closer rear view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX>, the
radar <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">antenna</ENAMEX> relentlessly turning. Look closely: Is that a set of rabbit ears
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mirrorlike</ENAMEX> object mounted atop the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> on our right? The almost
subliminal image tells us, but not the searchers, that they may have missed the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rabbit</ENAMEX>.

            Thinking that they've
spotted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the Bunny</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> clambers out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>, shouting and firing
off cameras--but it's just a woodchuck. The story reverses a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fairy</ENAMEX> tale that
these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> aren't that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> distant from: The hare is beating the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-wheeled gadget--the rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tortoise</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '90s</TIMEX>.

            Inside, a searcher gives the
off-camera <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interviewer</ENAMEX> an explanation that again repeats the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energizer</ENAMEX> slogan:
"It just keeps going and going--and therefore, you yourself have to keep going
and going." That might also serve as a mantra for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">'90s</NUMEX> generation, seeking
the constantly moving targets of meaning and success.

            The spot
closes with the name of the product chyroned across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Bunny</ENAMEX>-searching van
that just keeps going. Woodchuck refrains from identifying the product
because it's selling the name of the product, not the product itself. And if
you don't think the names of commodity products matter much in the marketplace,
then why do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> pay more for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calvins</ENAMEX> than they do for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fruit of the</ENAMEX>
Looms?
