<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX> approved a peace plan . Among other things, the plan appeases

            Judge
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norma Holloway Johnson</ENAMEX> ruled that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> cannot refuse to
testify before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> grand jury about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s behavior. She
rejected the argument, advanced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> and by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s surrogates, that this would endanger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX> by causing them to

Pro-democracy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> won the first legislative elections in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>
under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> rule. The naive spin: The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">democrats</ENAMEX> won. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-sophisticated
spin: The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">democrats</ENAMEX> get ripped off, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> rigged the election so
that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">seats</ENAMEX> were available. The rest are chosen by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> from which most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> are excluded. The fully sophisticated
spin: Despite getting ripped off, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">democrats</ENAMEX> have secured a political base
from which to harass and embarrass the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5/26/98</NUMEX>)

child-endangerment law that has been used to prosecute pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who
imperil their fetuses by using illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. The challenge by pro-choice
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> was based on narrow arguments, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> are spinning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>'s
action as a victory for fetal rights. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5/26/98</NUMEX>)

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> calls lotteries "a tax on the mathematically challenged."

anti-smoking education, research, health care, and cessation programs. Thus
far, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> have offered amendments to cap <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>' fees (defeated) and
