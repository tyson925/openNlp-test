               Appliances ,
produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hal Riney and Partners Advertising</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saturn</ENAMEX> Corp.

            
               Appliances opens with
a scene straight out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spielberg</ENAMEX>: A premonitory light shines from the upstairs
window of a darkened suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. Thunder claps, lightning strikes, and
Promethean electricity crackles down the pole. Let there be light! And so there
is, in the desk lamp that begins to move on its own.

            Appliances all around the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> activate, leaping and flying off <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counters</ENAMEX> and tables to the ground,
moving purposefully together across the floor. Although unplugged from their
sockets, the appliances continue to function, hinting at the battery-operated
product Appliances is selling--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saturn EV1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">electric car</ENAMEX>. The spot
alerts us to the promise of electricity made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mobile</ENAMEX>, the next electric
revolution. Light is a metaphor for life here, with animated appliances that
produce it scattered among the moving gadgets.

            This procession of
appliances spilling out onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX> also borrows heavily from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spielberg</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</ENAMEX> , in which the elect are
inexorably drawn to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Devil</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tower</ENAMEX>, where they await the arrival of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">extraterrestrial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spacecraft</ENAMEX>. The appliances gather in nervous expectation at
the curb, fidgeting and looking down the empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> that
represents the future doesn't descend, but glides down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> in a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>
dawn that seems to herald this new miracle.

            As in Close
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Encounters</ENAMEX> , at first we see only the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>'s lights. The video camera on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX> records the proceedings on its own, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">auto</ENAMEX>-focusing on the
distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. We get a glimpse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, refracted through a blender's thick
glass and reflected in a computer screen--our eyes going from the most
traditional appliance to the most modern to this postmodern <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>, which, we
assume by now, is powered by electricity, not <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gasoline</ENAMEX>. The toaster waddles
into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, and the other appliances on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX> fly or move closer to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. We hear the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX>'s voice for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and only time, the text as
spare as a biblical prologue: "The electric <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is here."

            The spot touches the
responsive chords of modern mythology and ancient religion. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mobile</ENAMEX>, of course. But this new, rather squat automobile is introduced in a
context that confers on it the mythic feel of transformative incarnation. It is
both substance of the present and symbol of the future.

            The spot
also reminds us of the power of television. This ad has to be seen to be
appreciated. Here, the very arrival of the product is enough to fascinate and
move us; it is almost as if the future had just happened. Unlike many
commercial and most political ads, the spot couldn't be put on radio with just
a few tweaks to the language. What would be a mundane announcement on
radio--"The electric <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is here"--becomes on television a compelling,
self-mocking event.
