warming . Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 15 years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, along with other
industrialized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>, must cut its emissions of greenhouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX> to a level
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> below its currently projected output. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX>
called it "the most significant multinational agreement ever on the world's
environment." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> praised the agreement while admitting
it faced immediate gridlock: Developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> refuse to reduce their
emissions until industrialized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> do so, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Senate</ENAMEX> refuses to
ratify the treaty until developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> sign on. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12/12</NUMEX>)
            

            A
federal judge ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> to stop requiring computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> to
bundle its Internet browser with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windows</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> hasn't decided whether
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> violated antitrust laws, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> contends, but he
ordered the halt just to make sure that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> doesn't devour the browser
market while the case is in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>'s spin: "Starting
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>, choice will be restored to the public." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s spin: 'Tis but a
scratch. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape</ENAMEX>'s spin: 'Tis but the first scratch. The superficial analysis:
It's just a temporary order. The intermediate analysis: It will probably be in
effect until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least June</TIMEX>, screwing up the release of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Windows 98</ENAMEX>, which was
supposed to merge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s browser and operating system. The advanced
analysis: Computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> will keep bundling the browser with Windows anyway,
because it's free. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12/12</NUMEX>)

"There was a tragic element to his life story," waxed the New York
