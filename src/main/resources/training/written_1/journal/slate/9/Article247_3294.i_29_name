            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> headline <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> said, "Internet Stock Fever
Spreads to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freeserve</ENAMEX>'s Issue Surges." And indeed, free
Internet-access provider <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freeserve</ENAMEX> did see its shares jump <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37 percent</NUMEX> on its
first day of trading. Of course, for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37 percent</NUMEX> gain hardly
constitutes Internet fever. But that's in no small part due to one crucial
difference between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and the nascent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> one: When
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> go public, there are a lot of shares to buy and sell.

            In the short term, after all, the prices of many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> Internet IPOs have
been inflated by the fact that there are just too few shares out there to meet
demand. A typical Internet IPO <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> will offer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">somewhere between 4</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million and 6 million</NUMEX> shares. That has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> consequences: It means <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companies</ENAMEX>
don't raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much</NUMEX> cash in the IPO as they might otherwise, and it means that
the pop on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first day</TIMEX> of trading is larger than it otherwise would be. And
while those <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">300 percent and 400 percent</NUMEX> leaps get lots of attention, the
company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reaps</ENAMEX> no long-term benefits from them.

            Freeserve, by contrast, is no bigger as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> that most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> Net
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">startups</ENAMEX>. In fact, with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just 2.73 million pounds</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its first eight months</TIMEX> of
operation, it's probably smaller than most. But in the offering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> it
floated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">153 million</NUMEX> shares (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">63 million</NUMEX> were offered by its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>
million by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freeserve</ENAMEX> itself), raising <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost 150 million pounds</NUMEX>. Now, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">153</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX> is still <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just a fifth</NUMEX> of all the shares outstanding. But the fact that
the "float"--the shares that can be bought and sold by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>--is so large
almost certainly kept the stock from rising even more sharply when it first
opened. (Of course, that's kind of scary when you consider how audacious the
market's valuation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freeserve</ENAMEX> is. This is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $10</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> revenue which now has a market cap of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.3 billion</NUMEX>.)

            In the long run, the size of the float doesn't determine anything. If demand
for shares remains strong, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> eventually offer more shares for sale in
secondary offerings. And if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>, then not even having a small
float can save it. When it comes to stocks, rarity doesn't mean value in the
long run. Given that, more Net <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> should think about forgoing the
pleasure of getting big headlines after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">their first day</TIMEX> of trading and choose
instead to get a real sense of what the market thinks of them. On the other
hand, I suppose that finding out what the market really thinks of them is the
last thing that a lot of Net <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> want.
