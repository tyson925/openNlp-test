            Rather perplexing that on a day when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> spooked the bond market
with talk of a possible--though still only possible--rate hike, bank stocks
were doing so well. (If inflation and interest rates are on the way up, that's
usually a bad thing for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>.) On the other hand, maybe it's not so
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">perplexing</ENAMEX>, just an indication that bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> aren't
hearing the same news, believing the same things, or expecting the same future.
Of course, most stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> apparently were hearing the same news
today, as tech stocks got battered again.

            What an odd week. The earnings numbers could not have been better. With the
rare exception, just about every tech bellwether that's reported has come in
ahead of expectations, and those were expectations that were about as high as
any reasonable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> could put them. But, again with the rare exception, all
these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bellwethers</ENAMEX> have seen their stock prices get crunched. This only goes to
show you one thing, which happens to be the most important thing to know about
investing: Trying to game the market in the short-term is the definition of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foolishness</ENAMEX>. Dump your money into an index fund, and you won't have to worry
about any of these anxieties disrupting your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> barbecues. And so, chat
on. (By the way, this will be the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last weekend</TIMEX> chatter for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of weeks</TIMEX>,
since 
                  Slate
               's running a short schedule <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX>. But we will
return.)

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. "Sometimes, apparently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> forgets itself.
Consider this description of a small <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> sect: 'Bruderhofs live
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communally</ENAMEX> and don't engage in violence, private-property ownership or
gossip .' I can just see it now. 'Jack's a brawler and he's always talking
behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s backs. But he doesn't own any property, so at least he's got
that going for him.'"

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. "Online music <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX> ... no, that's not exactly right. Online music
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digitizer</ENAMEX> ... no . Online music something MP3.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> went public to much
anticipation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, and saw its shares leap from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$28 to $105</NUMEX> in a matter of
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. Of course, the stock is now down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $61</NUMEX>. So you can say that
MP3.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>'s shares nearly quadrupled on their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first day</TIMEX> and that they were
cut almost in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> on their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first day</TIMEX>. Ain't the Net wonderful?"

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. "Best thing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> has said in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levin</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily Variety</ENAMEX> about possible successors to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Daly</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Semel</ENAMEX>, 'All current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> are speculation and unless you talk to
me it's all bullshit .' Of course, you wonder if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> then said,
'But I am talking to you.'"

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. "At long last, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPS</ENAMEX> is becoming a public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> . Now the next time
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> go on strike, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> will have another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> to bludgeon them
with. 'Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> demand that we hold the line on part-time labor and
wage increases!' Music to my ears."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. "Despite the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> are on the hook for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$71</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billion</NUMEX> to bail out a host of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has been
propping up for most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this decade</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> continues to insist that no
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">public</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> did anything wrong and that no one should be punished. 'Not
one single <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> lost a peso in their bank accounts,' a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance Ministry</ENAMEX> said. Apparently the pesos that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> are sending to the
government to bail out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> don't count."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elf Aquitaine</ENAMEX> made a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$51 billion</NUMEX> counterbid
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> to acquire competitor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TotalFina</ENAMEX>, which had previously announced a
hostile takeover attempt on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elf</ENAMEX>. 'You see, the problem isn't the merging part,'
you can almost hear the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elf</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> saying. 'The problem is the
us-losing-our-jobs part.'"

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. "From the most recent issue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> : 'When they envision
their future, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xers</ENAMEX> don't just see a government drifting toward the political
equivalent of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11</ENAMEX> ; they also see a crippled social structure, a
dwindling middle class, and a despoiled natural habitat.' Wow. Who knew that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Xers</ENAMEX> lived in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>?"
