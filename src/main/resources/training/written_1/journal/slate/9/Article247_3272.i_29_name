            It's difficult to imagine a working-class radical and avowed atheist even
being elected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late-20 th -century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, much less
sworn in. I guess we're not quite as modern as some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victorians</ENAMEX>, although we are
as primitive as others. Remember <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom DeLay</ENAMEX>'s recent tirade against the teaching
of evolution, which he blamed for the shootings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Littleton</ENAMEX>? Not to mention
the bill passed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> mandating the posting of the Ten
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commandments</ENAMEX> in public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> recently defeated a resolution
calling for all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> to abase themselves before God, but not before some
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> voted for it. Maybe we should replace the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX> with a revival
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tent</ENAMEX>.

            You can dismiss someone like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLay</ENAMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX>, but, in the wake of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Littleton</ENAMEX>, many moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> who disdain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creationism</ENAMEX> joined
him in decrying the nihilism supposedly engendered by our secular culture. You
and I disagree about the alleged skepticism of the chattering classes. From my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX>, most professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chatterers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> tend to be almost as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deferential</ENAMEX> to religion as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>. They may occasionally ponder the
appropriate place of religion in public life, but they rarely, if ever, express
any irreverence toward established religions (although they feel free to mock
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Age</ENAMEX>). If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gladstones</ENAMEX> are scarce <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, so are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menckens</ENAMEX>.

            We do agree that the pandering and preaching of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> is especially
loathsome. I'm afraid, however, that they do find it effective. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLay</ENAMEX> and his
comrades on the far right aren't playing to the variegated denominations you
mention; they're playing to their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> who aim to
please all of us, or as many as possible, traffic mostly in ecumenical
banalities about the virtue and values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godliness</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> talks nonsensically
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who "struggle to pass on the right values" to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. And
he confirms his own religiosity, deploring the "hollow secularism" that
supposedly afflicts the unenlightened. That's probably about the most fire and
brimstone that we'll hear from him. And while it may be foolish to deride
secularism as hollow, it's not particularly risky--not in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>.

            You don't need a crystal ball to know that we are likely to see more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">preaching</ENAMEX> and pandering, not less, as the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> election approaches. Having
successfully embraced a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> agenda on crime control, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> are
adopting Republicanesque rhetoric and policies on religion. Indeed, religion is
presented by both parties as an antidote to crime. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> has recently
declared his support for faith-based social services--publicly funded
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX>-service programs delivered by sectarian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>--which were
championed by conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Ashcroft</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</TIMEX> and
expressly authorized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> welfare bill.

            Faith-based social services are all the rage; they're apt to be implemented
widely in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few years</TIMEX>, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>-voucher programs. So, we're
likely to see an unprecedented diversion of tax dollars to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, mosques,
and synagogues. I can't wait for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> or the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Koresh</ENAMEX> to
establish a religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> seeking voucher <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> or apply for government
funds under a charitable choice provision. Do you think an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> like
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Center for Law and Justice</ENAMEX>, which fights for the rights of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christians</ENAMEX>, will take on the anti-discrimination suit of a New Age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guru</ENAMEX> denied
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> grant? I suspect that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> support faith-based services
only so long as they support the particular faith delivering the service.

            The challenge for the dwindling ranks of secularists is to convince people
that the separation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and state is not hostile to religion; it serves
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">religion</ENAMEX>, or rather it serves religions. Religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> who enjoy tax
exemptions should surely understand that. (And I should make clear that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">separationism</ENAMEX> does not require religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> to
withdraw from the political sphere; it requires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to withhold support
from sectarian activities and keeps government free of sectarian structures.)
Anyway, it should be obvious that secularism makes pluralism possible. That
prohibitions on establishing religion ensure free exercise is such a simple
concept, and yet it's so widely ignored. Sometimes I'm amused by all the
religious posturing, and sometimes I'm quite discouraged.

            Sometimes I put my faith in sectarian rivalries, which helped derail the
most recent proposed school-prayer amendment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>, Put God Back in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public School</ENAMEX>, decided not to press
for the introduction of official school prayers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> (instead, they
demanded state funding for special <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christian schools).</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> reconsidered
the value of school prayer after its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathy Smith</ENAMEX>, consulted with God:
"I asked God, 'Do you want me to change the law to put prayer in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>?'
He said no. If you do that, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> would have the right to pray to other <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gods</ENAMEX>
too. They could pray to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>. God doesn't want that. There is only one
God."

            What more can I say but "Amen."

            P.S.: I'm easy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cullen</ENAMEX>, anytime you want to have a face to face conversation,
just give me a call.
