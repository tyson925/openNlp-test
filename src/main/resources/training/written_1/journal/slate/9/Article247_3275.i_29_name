            Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JFK Jr.</ENAMEX>, most of us rarely if ever fly in private <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">airplanes</ENAMEX>. Many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, though, fly often in commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> and are familiar with
instructions on what to do in case of what is euphemistically called a "water
landing." Is there such a thing as a water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">landing</ENAMEX>, and what are your chances
of surviving one?

            If you define a water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">landing</ENAMEX> as a controlled, if
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unplanned</ENAMEX>, descent onto <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, as opposed to a simple crash, this is what
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">aviators</ENAMEX> call a "ditching." And, yes, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Coast Guard</ENAMEX>, there
is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ditching</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> waters. This includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopters</ENAMEX>
and all fixed-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>--military, air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX>, corporate, and general
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aviation</ENAMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that includes private <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> like the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flying</ENAMEX>). But there has never been a single ditching by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-flag commercial
airline. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">non-U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX> have experienced ditchings, with mixed
results: some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> died and some survived.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aviation Consumer Action Project</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Nader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
says that in an attempted water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">landing</ENAMEX>, a wide body jet would "shatter like a
raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> dropped on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pavement</ENAMEX>, killing most if not all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> on impact, even
in calm seas with well-trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> and good landing trajectories." Possibly
because ditchings are both virtually nonexistent and virtually nonsurvivable,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> does not require commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> to train
for them. Instead, it has various rules about how close <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> must be to an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">airfield</ENAMEX> on land.

            Any benefit from the procedures and precautions associated
with the phrase, "in the event of a water landing" are, at this point, purely
theoretical.
