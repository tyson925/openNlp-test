            "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> largest stock markets, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> market, are moving quickly to convert from non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> to
for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX>," begins the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> lead. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times goes with the news that, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>'s Taiwan <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strait</ENAMEX> crisis, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> quietly began forging an extensive military relationship
with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> leads with a piece on the tax bill the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>
recently passed and a similar one the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>'s considering.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> bill contains <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $100 billion</NUMEX> in direct tax breaks for
business. Among those designated for tax breaks: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Multinationals</ENAMEX>, small business
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Buffett</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX>-sponsored plans would cut
nearly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$800 billion</NUMEX> in taxes over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 10 years</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> waits till
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> paragraph to mention the bills need to be "sharply scaled down"
before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> signs it--wimpy wordy considering <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, "I will
not allow a risky plan to become law." Environmental and consumer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are
irked by the bills' concessions to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>, and nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX>, though
some, er, tree-huggers are happy about a provision allowing timber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to
write off the replanting costs.

            The uneasy relationship between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> could be further
disrupted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> news; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> now has "a considerably more
intimate relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> than with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>" says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> piece.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> authorized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> to engage in dialogue with
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s armed forces to an extent unprecedented since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carter</ENAMEX>
administrtation severed ties with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>; the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taiwan Relations</ENAMEX> Act
required the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> to provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> to defend itself.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> explained that the relationship was developed
to reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s sense of isolation, to gain a better sense of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s armed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forces</ENAMEX>, and to "respond to" a pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX>-dominated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> confirmed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that it plans to go public
by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-November</TIMEX>, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> piece. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">same day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> announced it
will review on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> a plan that could result in its going public by early
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>. "[H]<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ealthier</ENAMEX>, better financed, more adaptable <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> markets"
could result says the piece without explaining how, but the rush to go public
"leaves unanswered for now some key questions about how to regulate these
markets and contain their near-monopoly power." For-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stock exchanges</ENAMEX> have
grown in number since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX> but none exist in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> yet.

            The WP fronts low a story on a form of Internet communication called
instant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">messaging</ENAMEX>. It allows users to send notes that pop up in a box on the
screen of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient</ENAMEX> with the necessary software as they are being typed.
Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Corp.</ENAMEX> announced its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MSN Messenger</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Online</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Instant Messenger</ENAMEX> was the only instant messaging product most knew
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX>. However, others existed, like one put out by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prodigy</ENAMEX>, developed with the
idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> supported communication between different systems. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> says
its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Messenger</ENAMEX>, unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX>'s, would allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to communicate with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of
either product. Twice on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> blocked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> from sending
messages to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. Though the computer industry had urged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> to publish
technical details of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Instant Messenger</ENAMEX> to allow other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> to develop
software compatible with it, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> piece claims <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> refused because it
"wants to control the messaging market."

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> 's off-lead coverage of the same story outdoes its WP
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analog</ENAMEX>. First, it more clearly explains the technology and does so earlier in
the piece. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, it reports <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> more important facts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yahoo</ENAMEX> also introduced
messaging software on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s, could send message to
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AOL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> claimed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yahoo</ENAMEX> have violated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> copyrights and
trademark. The piece also explicitly points out the irony in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s
argument that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> "is using its exclusive technology to prevent fair
competition based on open standards," which is "exactly the complaint from
Netscape that prompted ... [the] antitrust suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>." A
discrepancy between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pieces: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> says that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> AOL blocked
a similar product put out by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prodigy; WP</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prodigy</ENAMEX> was notified
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prodigy users</ENAMEX> would no longer have access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX>'s
service.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> is alone in fronting word that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Army</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> on a mission "to
take pictures of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coca cultivation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scout</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>"
was reported missing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>. "It was the first reported disappearance of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX>," though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Colombian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> have
been cooperating for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> should say how many--to battle
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">narcotics</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> is alone fronting news that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> were shot to
death <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> in the deadliest incident since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> got to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX>. No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspects</ENAMEX> have been apprehended.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> off-leads, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the other two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">front</ENAMEX>, news of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JFK Jr.</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">memorial Mass</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manhattan's Church of St. Thomas More</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clintons</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kenneth Galbraith</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Schlesinger Jr.</ENAMEX>, Muhammad
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali</ENAMEX>, and hip-hop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyclef Jean</ENAMEX> were among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendees</ENAMEX>. In his eulogy, Sen.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward M. Kennedy</ENAMEX> recounted what his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX> said after being asked what he
would do if elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>: " 'I guess the first thing is call up <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uncle</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy</ENAMEX> and gloat.' I loved that. It was so like his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>."
