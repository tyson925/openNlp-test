            Fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnists</ENAMEX> have been
suggesting that the chic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s skirt will fall below the knee <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next fall</TIMEX>.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parisian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> windows are full of columnar skirts meant to graze
the shoe tops, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the street adhere in great numbers to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">miniskirt</ENAMEX>--that is, anything <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 inches</NUMEX> or more above the knee. The movable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hemline</ENAMEX> goes on being a key visual element in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> of female appearance.
Wherever the line is drawn, a suggestive point is being made about female
legs--about their provocative relationship to the pelvis and to the eager
glance of the beholder. Pants just can't offer anything quite like it.

            Popular
fashion history claims that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Woman</ENAMEX> was created when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> gave up
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corsets</ENAMEX>. But that moment never quite occurred, at least not as it has been
portrayed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> have been shaping their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> to suit shifting ideas of
feminine beauty not only for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> before modernity but ever since. The
temporary abandonment of tight little waists represented no more than a change
in method. The most important moment in the modernization of female dress was
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> cut off their skirts for good.

            That was just before <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a decade</TIMEX> before the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> most important moment, when they cut off their hair for good. These two
radical acts made irreversible transformations in female appearance. They
created a new shape for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, dynamic and changeable--and yet somehow so
permanent that the little female logo on the women's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">restroom</ENAMEX> can doubtless
keep her knee-length skirt and chin-length hair forever. No matter how low or
high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s hemlines become or how much their hair length varies, the point of
all such changes--including those in store for us <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next fall</TIMEX>--is to show that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have the choice to lift their skirts and crop their hair. Before the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 th century</TIMEX>, they didn't.

            Long
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">skirts</ENAMEX>, like long hair, had been required for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> by religious law and
general custom since time immemorial. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 600 years</TIMEX> when fashion
developed its own history, both skirts and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> were considered immutable, even
when fashion went to extremes. There were moments of deviation--the bloomer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">costume</ENAMEX>, for example, with full trousers showing below short skirts--but they
never lasted long. The arrival of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s legs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first quarter</TIMEX> of this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> was a genuine shock.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX>'s legs were known to be there, but they
were meant to be seen and judged privately. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX>'s legs obey mechanical laws,
of course, and move apart while they are being used. Watching them do that has
always been a volatile matter for the male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX>. Throughout all those heavily
skirted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> paid good money to watch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s legs prancing, kicking,
and leaping on the stage, since on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, the shift of weight was about
all that could be discerned.

            The
mythology of the feminine had a lot to do with the veiling of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s lower
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>. The thick, floor-length skirt produced the sense of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, secret
treasures difficult (and perhaps unwise) to discover. It's not surprising that
at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of this century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who wished to declare a new parity with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, to escape feminine mystery and enter female reality, should shun male
gear. It was too frivolous and perverse. Instead, they remodeled the skirt. If
a skirt could be shorter and simpler, female legs and feet could be seen at
work, the normal action of knees and thighs would be apparent under its neat
shape, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> could at last be seen to make strides. Her brains and her
feet could be seen to connect, and she would become a normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human being</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skirts</ENAMEX> had risen above the ankle by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1913</TIMEX>, went up nearly to
the knee during the war in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1915-17</TIMEX>, and had a steep postwar drop back down to
the ankle in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1922</TIMEX>, a steep rise to mid-knee in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1925</TIMEX>, another drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX>, and
so on. Once off the ground, the skirt's exact length became a burning issue,
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> about hellfire itself, since a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> with visible legs was seen by many
to be walking toward her damnation. Then a range of personal worries about the
exact level of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hem</ENAMEX> came into play. Shorter might be too silly or too
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">daring</ENAMEX>, longer too staid or too sultry, either choice might be too modish or
too tawdry. Such uncertainties stirred up ever-ready fashion hatred and made
the hemline into a derogatory synonym for fashionable change. Legs turned out
to be problematic: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-swinging</ENAMEX> or up-sliding hem invited not only the eye
but the hand. It soon became clear that dispelling mystery involved more than
compelling ordinary respect.

            With the
miniskirt of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX>, the public received another shock. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pants</ENAMEX> gave skirts freedom
to be outrageous, and up they went to within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an inch</NUMEX> of the crotch. And there
many of them stay, with all the other lengths proposed in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, including back down to the floor and even trailing.

            
The miniskirt was a truly revolutionary
departure. The heavy threat of the ancient long skirt was long
forgotten--that's not what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miniskirts</ENAMEX> rebelled against. The miniskirt arrived
not only as a separate garment but also as the bottom of a little dress, worn
with big, teased-out hair and big, blunt-toed shoes. Suddenly, everybody began
to look like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shirley Temple</ENAMEX> in her singing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-star <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>--all bouncy hair and
wiggly legs, with a tiny dress in the middle--no waist, no breasts, no hips,
and pale lipstick went with it. The look was a bid to be a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> again,
with all a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'s irresponsible eroticism. Adult female reality was
proving too hard, perhaps.

            All real
little girls' dresses from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '20s</TIMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">'60s</NUMEX> had been crotch-length. In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those years</TIMEX>, no adult skirts ever rose that high, except maybe on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>--tiny
skirts were conventionally part of the innocence of childhood. But as soon as
the miniskirt became part of the adult erotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arsenal</ENAMEX>, little girls' dresses
sank below the knee, right where they had been in mid-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> times and where
they still are, guarding traditional female decorum as their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elders</ENAMEX>' skirts no
longer do. The sexiness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> has lately been thoroughly acknowledged,
which may be why their tasty little legs are now conventionally covered.

            The original miniskirt had another revolutionary side--it
was another theft by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, only disguised. Pants were an old story,
and they were no longer strictly male; but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> short-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tunic</NUMEX>-and-tights
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">costume</ENAMEX>, especially when worn with high boots, cropped hair, and a hip-level
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">belt</ENAMEX>, seemed to put <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> into the clothes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youths</ENAMEX>, so they
looked like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpaccio</ENAMEX> dandies or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ghirlandaio toughs</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daggers</ENAMEX> were not added,
but the effect of privileged male freedom was very telling--maybe with a touch
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arc</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Girls</ENAMEX> in such androgynous gear looked ready for any
adventure.

            All such
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Hood</ENAMEX> allusions have long since been extinguished. There followed the
epoch of leg warmers and other mutations into the aerobics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> look.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miniskirts</ENAMEX> withdrew from such sweaty connotations, emphasizing instead their
harmony with classic jackets. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX>, most miniskirts stop quite a few
inches below the crotch. They have mainstream acceptance and no shock value,
and are worn by young career <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmothers</ENAMEX> alike.

            
Though many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> still wear their skirts very,
very short, novelty has lately required increasing their length, not their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brevity</ENAMEX>--and many new long skirts are resembling <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Sea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wraparounds</ENAMEX>, often
gauzy, to suggest more exotic freedoms, newer ways for longer skirts to seduce.
Once everybody goes in for length, let's give it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three years</TIMEX>--the same
period as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1922 and 1925</TIMEX>, say--and then expect another rise, with other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">connotations</ENAMEX>. The fashion business sees to it that interest in shifting skirt
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lengths</ENAMEX> is never exhausted.

            But perhaps after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a hundred</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of skirts that liberate and expose, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> will again feel the desire for
fullness, drag, and bulk in their skirts; for the chance to swish, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trail</ENAMEX>, and
sweep; to swing heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fabric</ENAMEX> from the hips; maybe even to lift heavy folds in
front of the belly--or simply to have another way of muffling unsatisfactory
legs with something that isn't pants. The couture ball dress and the standard
wedding dress do, after all, keep suggesting the possibility, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar</ENAMEX> outfit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> suggests that full gowns have even attained the status
of something <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde</ENAMEX>.
