            If you believe demography,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American Jewish</ENAMEX> life is disappearing: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Fifty-two percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American Jews</ENAMEX> marry
non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>. If you believe your own eyes, you'll conclude the opposite. Stroll
down the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper West Side</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>. The former world
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> of secular Judaism, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> humanism, even flat-out radicalism,
will be filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Orthodox</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> wandering to and from shul, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wigs</ENAMEX> and long dresses, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> otherworldly in clothes bare of sports
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insignia</ENAMEX>.

            Or go to a good bookstore
and check out the work of a group of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelists</ENAMEX> busily turning the
conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> identity crisis on its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. For these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>--let's call
them the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philo-traditionalists</ENAMEX>--the modern world that lured the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Roths</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saul Bellows</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Mailers</ENAMEX> away from their childhood enclaves doesn't
glisten with its old come-hither. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the three decades</TIMEX> since the heyday of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> novel, secularity has grown tarnished. It is now seen as
leading to self-absorbed self-destruction rather than to individual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fulfillment</ENAMEX>. What the new generation embraces is the past, a godly past hedged
in by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and ritual that will <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> perhaps--or so they dream--be
restored.

            Take a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lapsed Hasid</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearl Abraham</ENAMEX>. In her autobiographical <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> novel The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romance Reader</ENAMEX> , she told the familiar (to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaim Potok</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>) tale
of being forced out of her sect by her own intellectual and sexual curiosity.
But in her <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giving Up America</ENAMEX> , which comes out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>,
she all but rejects that rejection. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> is an unhappy ad copy writer
whose callow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> has fallen for a would-be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss America</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contestant</ENAMEX>. She
must return to her family to reimmerse herself in the eternal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hasidic</ENAMEX> truths
before she can make something like peace with her life.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, the country <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rabbis</ENAMEX> condemned as the
trayfe medina --the unholy land, the faithless land--is now producing a
literature of faith. But hasn't there always been a literature of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> faith?
What about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Malamud</ENAMEX>, with his discombobulated folk <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bashevis Singer</ENAMEX>, with his tortured <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX> and Lithuanian
rabbinical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>? The difference has everything to do with the passage of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philo-traditionalists</ENAMEX> (the best of them, anyway) are bringing life
and imagination to a kind of writing all but given up for moribund, and
besides, they're producing a literature of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> faith. No longer is
religious practice or a sense of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> continuity the prerogative of displaced
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> gazing with horror upon the vacuousness of their assimilated
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia Ozick</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doyenne</ENAMEX> of contemporary observant
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, used to make her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> and heroines <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazis</ENAMEX>,
struggling to fortify their shredded piety against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> profanity. But
even she has gone native. In a brilliant novel published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puttermesser Papers</ENAMEX> , her eponymous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth Puttermesser</ENAMEX>, becomes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> and embraces a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitmanesque</ENAMEX> vision of urban
harmony--<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> and everyone together--before being undone by a
rapacious golem.

            Then there are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
themselves, who are much less vacuous than predicted and insist that they, too,
can have a connection to the past. The brutally funny <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Stern</ENAMEX> ( Lazar
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malkin Enters Heaven</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Kaplan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Adventures Underground , A</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plague of Dreamers</ENAMEX> ) does this by inventing a shtetl that out-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singers</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singer</ENAMEX> in its weirdness and filth and then putting it in pre-World <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War II</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Memphis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tenn.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thane Rosenbaum</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elijah Visible</ENAMEX> , grants his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, who are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>, the right to suffer
their own highly American litany of post-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> disorders.

            Oddly
enough, it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Singer</ENAMEX> who wrote the prototext of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> post-assimilationism,
Shadows on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson</ENAMEX> , which was only published, posthumously, earlier
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> (though it was written in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '50s</TIMEX> and set even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>). It is a
stunning, heartbreaking novel, the darkest and most modern of his works,
largely because it is the most bitter about modernity. Its anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hertz</ENAMEX>
Grein, an erudite <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugee</ENAMEX> and serial deserter of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, turns his back
on a secular life gone hideously awry and migrates to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, joining the most
extreme sect of ultra-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Orthodox</ENAMEX> he can find. This is a New World sort of move,
even if made by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugee</ENAMEX>, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European Jewish</ENAMEX> émigrés,
whether cultured cosmopolitans or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the pious bourgeoisie, don't
suddenly convert to fundamentalism; that's a specialty of godless
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>.

            
Now there's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allegra Goodman</ENAMEX>, whose
enthusiastically reviewed <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kaaterskill Falls</ENAMEX> , appears poised
to become the crossover <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> novel of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>. The book takes place over
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three summers</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1970s</TIMEX> in and around a mitnaged (rationalist,
anti-mystical, non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hasidic</ENAMEX>) ultra-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Orthodox</ENAMEX> sect, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kirschners</ENAMEX>, who followed
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rabbi</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington Heights</ENAMEX> just before <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> and
have taken to summering in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hamlet</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Catskills</ENAMEX>. Don't mistake
this for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Catskills</ENAMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Borscht Belt</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Catskills</ENAMEX> is a
not particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> and now largely forgotten resort <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> that was once
the height of chic, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamptons</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 th century</TIMEX>, as well as
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson River</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">School</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX>. The novel's title alludes to a
famous painting by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Cole</ENAMEX> that hangs in a nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>.

            In short, the grandeur of
the past--<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>--is the theme here. The older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>, including
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rabbi</ENAMEX>, possesses the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> graces. They're erudite and sophisticated
and carry their rituals off with comparable ease. Ease, that is, compared with
the next generation, which is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman</ENAMEX>'s real focus. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>-born
Kirschners are more rigid, less worldly than their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rabbi</ENAMEX>
frets about them: "They are good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>," he tells his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>. "But they are very
simple . ... They are afraid of the Mind, and to read. They don't read
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schiller</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>. How can I say it to you? They keep the one thing,
the religious, alive. It is the most important, but they have lost the other.
They have forgotten the poetry. There is not one of them who is what we used to
call an <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Educated Man</ENAMEX>."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman</ENAMEX>
has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> advantages over her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>. With an advanced degree in literature,
she has read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiller</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>, and she is writing 20 years
later, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Judaism</ENAMEX> has grown less awkward about itself. In fact, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> of her novel lies in its casualness, the way it makes the extremes of
religious practice seem cozily normal. Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Potok</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abraham</ENAMEX> can immerse
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> in the minutiae of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hasidic</ENAMEX> life the way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman</ENAMEX> does in the
particulars of separatist <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> ultra-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orthodoxy</ENAMEX>.

            Another refreshing feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman</ENAMEX>'s storytelling is
that, unlike other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of fundamentalist sects one might find in novels,
her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> don't chafe at their restrictions, or not too much. At the
beginning of the novel the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Shulman</ENAMEX>, feels so at home in her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Jewish</ENAMEX> skin that "God and the scriptures, worship and ritual, are all simple,
practical things for her." Indeed, she's one of the few deeply observant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> you're likely to encounter who "does not romanticize religion. ...
The sacred is not mysterious to her." Rather, she "romanticizes the secular.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poetry</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>, and paintings fill her with awe." It's typical of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman</ENAMEX>'s blend of the sublime and the haimish (homey) that when
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth</ENAMEX> experiences an epiphany while looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX>'s picture, it is the
revelation of a most unambitious ambition: She wants to open a kosher grocery
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">store</ENAMEX>. In an ultra-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Orthodox</ENAMEX> setting, of course, that's not a simple step. It
requires, for example, permission from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rabbi</ENAMEX> and renting from an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anti-Semitic landlord</ENAMEX>. By the end of the book, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shulman</ENAMEX> has bumped up against
the edges of her life, but she doesn't yearn to escape it, exactly. She has
merely learned that her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> are capable of stupid mistakes in their
dealings with her. She has no intention of leaving, first because her doubt is
not enough to sever her from her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> because that's
not the kind of story it is.

            The novel has its flaws.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman</ENAMEX>'s explanations of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> ritual sometimes veer from the helpful to the
condescendingly overexplicit, as if she were writing for young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Shulman</ENAMEX>
aside, you could find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-line descriptions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman</ENAMEX>'s main <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> in any
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">half-dozen American</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> novels: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rabbi</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX>, one brilliant and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prodigal</ENAMEX>, one duller but more loyal; the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX> numbed by his past;
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> tempted by the twin heresies of feminism and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zionism</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> is
viewed as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> of faithless sinners by these ultra-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Orthodox Jews</ENAMEX>); the
assimilationist <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX> who comes to a bad end. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman</ENAMEX> makes them believable,
at least, despite bits of soggy sentimentality; she makes you care. (The
exception is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">non-Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>, who are almost all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soap</ENAMEX> operaish
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">white</ENAMEX> trash.) And whatever one's quibbles, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman</ENAMEX> should be credited with
doing what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Singer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malamud</ENAMEX> and even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozick</ENAMEX> were never really able to do:
making the most rigorous form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judaism</ENAMEX> seem plausible as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
life.
