            The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">other day</TIMEX>, as I was
sitting at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cafe</ENAMEX> watching all the summery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> sitting around or
sauntering past, something struck me. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Blondes</ENAMEX> were everywhere, their bright
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thatches</ENAMEX> catching the sun, but until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that minute</TIMEX>, I hadn't taken proper notice
of the fact that not one of them was a natural. A few flaxen-headed children
under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> were, maybe. But I saw no teen-age, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX>, or elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blondes</ENAMEX> whose
blond hair actually covered their scalps all the way to the roots. Everybody
had abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">streaks</ENAMEX> or sizable tracts of blondness, all supported by dark
roots under the outer layers of golden glow.

            I further
realized that this had been the case for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and that I
hadn't seen a real blonde--the kind with pale lashes to match--since the last
time I was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>. If you remain a pure blonde at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 these days</TIMEX>, you have
to dye your hair coppery red or pitch-black or give up all hope of chic.
Natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blondness</ENAMEX>, once the badge of physical and moral perfection, now marks
you as hopelessly true-blue, white-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>, straight-arrow, old hat. You're no
longer enticingly innocent and desirable but boringly earnest, naive, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">solemn</ENAMEX>.

            True blondes used to thank providence for their hair, then
paint their brows and lashes dark to create enough smolder to match its
conventionally sexy shimmer. Dark-haired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> could dye their hair blond, but
no trace of the original color was permitted to show. Popular fiction of the
1940s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'50s</ENAMEX> was full of scathing descriptions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> whose deceptive
blondness was dark at the roots. It was the visual evidence of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">feet</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX>, a
heart of sloth, a general moral degradation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blondness</ENAMEX> could be false; but
integrity dwelt in keeping it perfect. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dimming</ENAMEX> natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blondes</ENAMEX> would
scrupulously dye the blond back in and touch up all traces of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shadow</ENAMEX> at the
roots <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX>.

            Today,
sober or smoldering brunettes leave their natural roots in place and add
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blondness</ENAMEX> to taste, as a patent ornament and sophisticated reference. Hair dye
that proclaims itself as such used to be marginal and nonfashionable, the
exclusive privilege of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitutes</ENAMEX>, actresses, strippers, drag queens, and
anybody who didn't mind being taken for them. Now it is modish for both sexes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Rodman</ENAMEX> undoubtedly had a lot to do with this. Lately, we have all wanted
to resemble exciting, quasimarginal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX>. We want to show that we are
not afraid of their beauty secrets and can appropriate their willful blondness
or other visual caprices for our own ends.

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> popular scheme for hair--top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> blond,
bottom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> dark--seems to have originated in the punk styles of the late
1980s, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> bleached the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of their spiky hair so they could dye it
green or purple. When the colors washed out, the bleached-blond effect
remained; and when the whole thing grew out, the dark roots showed up under the
pale spikes--presto! a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde</ENAMEX> fashion, contemporaneous with the start
of body piercing. These evolving styles were much deplored by the mainstream at
the time and have duly been adopted by all and sundry.

            Intrigued
by all this, I looked at a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Paris Match</ENAMEX> for some pictures of
desirable female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blondes</ENAMEX>. There was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelly Preston</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Travolta</ENAMEX>,
her blond pile of hair covering only the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of her skull, her nape and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temples</ENAMEX> brown. There, too, was the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julie Delpy</ENAMEX>, with a flowing
blond mane and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an inch</NUMEX> of dark roots, the new ideal of perfect blond young
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">womanhood</ENAMEX>. And there on the next page was the old ideal. It was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grace Kelly</ENAMEX>
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1952</TIMEX>, every bright golden hair on her head springing straight through her
scalp out of her pure mind and elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX> and reverently coiled into a
triumph of gleaming sculpture.

            Next I looked at blondes from the more distant past. Titian
is the most famous for painting golden hair, along with his many Venetian
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX>, and it's also well known that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> dyed their hair blond. There's a famous engraving showing them doing it,
with a detailed description of the method.

            What were the results? Many
beauties portrayed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Titian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma Vecchio</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paris Bordone</ENAMEX> catch the eye
with their rippling cascades and looped braids of brilliant yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX>. But a
closer look shows they all have dark eyes and dark eyebrows and that their hair
spreads from a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> part where <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">at least an inch</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of dark roots is
clearly visible on either side. You can usually see more darkness along the
hairline behind the ears, too. So these <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Venetians</ENAMEX> were theoretical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blondes</ENAMEX>,
just like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delpy</ENAMEX>. Their dyed hair was meant not to deceive but to
function as a sort of witty allusion to an outworn creed.

            In the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">humanist High Renaissance</ENAMEX>, golden hair brought to mind the secular and
classical beauty of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venus</ENAMEX> and her mythological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, whom such beauties
often posed as. At the same epoch, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Virgin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary by Titian</ENAMEX> would be
forthrightly dark-haired. But his errant and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">penitent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Magdalene</ENAMEX> would use
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venus</ENAMEX>' skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hairdresser</ENAMEX>.

            
To find the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grace Kelly</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> painting,
you have to go back to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 th century</TIMEX> in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>,
and especially the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>. There you see breathtakingly pure and candid
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">golden</ENAMEX> hair, flowing down from the Virgin's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> in a natural veil, suggesting
the descending rays of an ultimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blessing</ENAMEX> from above. Eve wears it too, as do
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female saints</ENAMEX>--the wayward <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Magdalene</ENAMEX> included--and many princesses. No
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">artifice</ENAMEX> assists these honeylike waves. This is celestially ordained blondness,
the mark of God's favor, affirming the signal beauty of the old pagan deities
who had already given all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blondes</ENAMEX>--torrid or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">chilly</TIMEX>, fake or real--an edge for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,000 years</TIMEX>.

            It's a sign of a permanently
altered world that natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blondness</ENAMEX> should have such sacred power no longer.
Instead, we have reinvented the much more flexible and imaginative Venetian
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blondness</ENAMEX>. We have a new awareness of how limiting and unfair the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cult</ENAMEX> of fair
hair can be. Natural dark-haired beauty--despised or exoticized for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eons</TIMEX> by
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britons</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>--has at last been universally recognized and
welcomed. Its varicolored roots have grown in for all to see and for all to
reckon with. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blondness</ENAMEX> has become just one of the many attractive ways to adorn
dark hair.
