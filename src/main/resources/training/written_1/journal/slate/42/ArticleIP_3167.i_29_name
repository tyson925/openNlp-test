            Language, we all know,
allows us to say something. Yet it is also frequently called upon to say
nothing. There are semantically and grammatically complex ways of doing this,
as study of the transcript of any <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eisenhower</ENAMEX> press conference will demonstrate.
There are also sundry off-the-rack locutions that can dress up language to
similar effect, such as the long-established blah 
               blah

               blah , which, in a famous <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far</ENAMEX> 
               Side cartoon, is what animals
perceive human beings to be saying to one another.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent months</TIMEX>, in
contexts where I have grown accustomed to expect a resigned or satiric
blah 
               blah 
               blah , I have been hearing the phrase
yadda 
               yadda 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yadda</ENAMEX> instead, as in: "<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> they tell me one
thing, then they tell me another thing, yadda 
               yadda

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yadda</ENAMEX> ." My own informal tracking, conducted over a period of several
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, suggests a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">blah - blah - blah</ENAMEX> displacement rate of
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50 percent</NUMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirtysomething</TIMEX>-and-under demographic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>. In
attempting to "walk back the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>" (to use the increasingly prevalent argot of
the intelligence services for tracing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of events backward to establish a
point of origin), I have found <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">yadda - yadda - yadda</ENAMEX> strands
in episodes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seinfeld</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Improvement</ENAMEX> . The most compelling
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">manifestation</ENAMEX>, though, is in an advertisement for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Converse</ENAMEX> athletic shoes
featuring images of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Johnson</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenix Suns</ENAMEX> that was aired on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> television during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last spring</TIMEX>'s basketball championships:

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Plus</ENAMEX>, he
don't badmouth anybody. He don't <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> an attitude. Ffff! You'd have to be nuts
not to want a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> like that on your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>. So anyways, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KJ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KJ</ENAMEX>, he's our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ya ta da Ya ta da Ya ta da</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Converse</ENAMEX>."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who wrote the copy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Herstek</ENAMEX>, the creative
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>-based advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, recalls that he had <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four seconds</TIMEX>
to fill in a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-second</TIMEX> commercial. "Yadda 
               yadda 
               yadda ,"
whose spelling he was uncertain of, "simply seemed funnier than blah

               blah 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blah</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX> cetera, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX> cetera ."

            Why did the term occur to
Herstek at all? An associate of his from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a decade ago</TIMEX>, he says, used
it from time to time "along with a lot of other phrases that sounded <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>."
The various lexicographers I have consulted are quite certain, however, that
yadda 
               yadda 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yadda</ENAMEX> is not of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> origin.

            Although
the term is known to have been around for a while, documentary evidence for it
is sparse--as is so often the case in matters involving oral culture. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herstek</ENAMEX> indicated that he, like me, was now hearing yadda 
               yadda

               yadda more frequently than ever, but he modestly disclaimed
responsibility. True, our experience could simply be the result of what might
be called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Awareness Tautology</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">One</ENAMEX>'s sense of a phenomenon's pervasiveness
is heightened by the fact of one's having been alerted to the phenomenon in the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place. Still, yadda 
               yadda 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yadda</ENAMEX> 's nascent currency
is indirectly confirmed by the matter-of-fact use, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times , of the term in the participial phrase "doing the
yadda - yadda ."

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> things are happening. First, a newly
prominent form of what is known as "sound symbolism" is crowding out some older
ones in competition for a familiar piece of habitat. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English</ENAMEX> has long had
various ways of mimicking the generic sound of spoken language, the noise of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>, or idle chatter (chatter being such a word). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> of onomatopoeic
and reduplicative terms for spoken language is large : blather, buzz-buzz,
chitchat, fiddle-faddle, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">jibber-jabber</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">yakety-yak</ENAMEX>, yuk-yuk . The earliest
appearances of something resembling yadda 
               yadda 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yadda</ENAMEX> in
print derive from its use in sound-symbolic fashion, as in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> from a
short story (about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anthropomorphic ducks</ENAMEX>) appearing in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX> issue of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evening Post</ENAMEX> :

            "Stop it, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>!" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minnie</ENAMEX>
would call crossly. "Pay attention to your flying, for pity's sake!"

            "Back-seat flying," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>
would grumble. "Always the yaddega-yaddega from the back seat."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wentworth</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flexner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX> 
               of 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slang</ENAMEX> provides
a citation for the similar form yatata yatata yatata from the play
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jim</ENAMEX> 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dandy : A Fat Man in a Famine</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</TIMEX>) by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saroyan</ENAMEX>. A different sort of theatrical provenance is offered by an informant
with experience in several large-cast stage productions. In scenes where people
in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> are supposed to be talking animatedly but unintelligibly to one
another, she observes, the effect is sometimes achieved by having half the cast
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> say blah 
               blah 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blah</ENAMEX> and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> say
yadda 
               yadda 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yadda</ENAMEX> .

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> thing happening is not so much etymological as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sociological</ENAMEX>: a continuing evolution in semantic function. Terms such as
yadda 
               yadda 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yadda</ENAMEX> and blah 
               blah 
               blah
have a special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> can accurately fill in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blanks</ENAMEX>--when the terms act not as synonyms for "generic talk" but as command
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">keys</ENAMEX>, cued to circumstance, that can designate specific information. In other
words, what yadda 
               yadda 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yadda</ENAMEX> can convey is something
like: "You and I know all the points that would ordinarily be inserted at this
place in the conversation, so let's just skip it and move on."

            This usage points to
yadda 
               yadda 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yadda</ENAMEX> 's larger social significance: It
suggests that an ever-larger percentage of the content of everyday
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> can be correctly anticipated--probably owing in part to the sheer
repetition of words and arguments in the various public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. I am not aware
of any studies comparing the number of words an average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> could expect to
hear spoken in a typical day <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">500 years ago</TIMEX> vs. the number that can be heard
now, but the increase surely is vast. If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> were to say <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> that he
opposes abortion except when yadda 
               yadda 
               yadda , we would
all know what he means, and we would know what was meant if, after an arrest, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police officer</ENAMEX> pulled out a card and just said yadda 
               yadda

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yadda</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adults</ENAMEX> have always been struck by how much teen-age communication
can seemingly be accomplished by emitting one of perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</NUMEX> subverbal
phonemes, and it will be instructive to watch as something along these same
lines spreads to the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.

            As noted, lexicographers for
obvious reasons have far more trouble gathering oral citations than written
ones. To aid the larger lexicographical enterprise, I'm interested in
collecting samples of references to yadda 
               yadda 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yadda</ENAMEX> (or
similarly imitative terms) in any communications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> other than paper. Date
and explicit provenance must be provided. The information will be turned over
to experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>. It would only be fitting that yadda

               yadda 
               yadda make it formally into one dictionary before obviating
the need for dictionaries at all.
