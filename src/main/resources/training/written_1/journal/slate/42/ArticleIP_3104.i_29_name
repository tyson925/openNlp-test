            It isn't
just the widening international scope of the fashion industry that makes
clothing design everybody's business <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>. It's the shows, which are ever
more fantastic, and the press coverage of them, which is ever more hysterically
serious. It certainly isn't the clothes. If you look around at what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are actually wearing in the big fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX>--you'll see very little evidence that runway fashion has any impact at
all. The extreme garments created for the shows may be worn, occasionally, by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in fashion, showbiz, or society. But the only way the public has of
relating to these items is to gasp at them and applaud them, swoon over them
and deplore them, laugh at them and compare them--and it's not even the clothes
that evoke these responses, it's their likenesses transmitted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>.

            On television, we see
close-up interviews with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> babbling tensely just before the show and
gasping with relief and fatigue afterward. This lets us know how epic the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX>'s personal ordeal has been, how heroic his endurance. The other epic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> of the show are insistent music, striking lighting, and a piquant
setting, perhaps a skating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rink</ENAMEX>. But these are beside the point. The central
focus of everything is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bevy</ENAMEX> of unbelievable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and the way they work.
Clothes, no matter how outrageous, don't register by themselves. It's the girls
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parading</ENAMEX> around in them that make the show, dazzle the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>, magnetize the
cameras, and entrance the world. Them, and the obscurely thrilling knowledge
that they are paid enormous sums to do it.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> I attended the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vivienne Westwood</ENAMEX> fashion
show. Several palatial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corridors</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th century</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hôtel Crillon</ENAMEX> were given over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>; they were packed with rows of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">golden</ENAMEX> chairs leaving a serpentine passage for the parade, and surrounded by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> of lights and ranks of camerapeople. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> was an untidy mix,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">milling</ENAMEX> and chattering in several languages and photographing each other during
the long wait, some dressed in startling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westwoody</ENAMEX> costumes. A tape of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baroque</ENAMEX>
music began, the mumbling stopped, and on came the procession of ravishing
visions. They passed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">inches</NUMEX> from me, stalking and swaying, pausing
occasionally, casting friendly looks on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and all. They were very young and
very slim, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 feet</NUMEX> tall and distinctively beautiful, each wondrously clad in a
wide range of strong colors and textures that were cut and fitted or draped and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">buttoned</ENAMEX> to mold the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and occasionally expose the bosom or upper thighs.
(In this show, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westwood</ENAMEX> again demonstrated her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> for employing authentic
historical styles to achieve shockingly modern erotic results.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> all
had fluffy, multicolored piles of hair and bee-stung lips and wore very
high-heeled boots or shoes, so they looked like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> even though each costume
was different.

            Such ensemble work is
crucial at fashion shows. On television the camera rests fleetingly and
incompletely on a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfit</ENAMEX>. But in life the important thing is the
mesmerizing sequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Jacobs</ENAMEX> show for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Vuitton</ENAMEX>, the
girls all had bare legs and flat mules and their hair hung down perfectly
straight. They wore no makeup at all. The clothes were unshaped and the colors
restrained. But everybody was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 feet</NUMEX> tall and slim, very young and very
beautiful, and paraded with the same pleasing, well disposed manner and well
paced gait through the perversely austere production.

            At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanvin</ENAMEX>, there were many nipples visible through
transparent fabrics. At <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guy Laroche</ENAMEX>, there were glittering red sheaths below
huge wigs. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Issey Miyake</ENAMEX>, there was stiff fabric sculpted around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>,
as always. At <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Paul Gaultier</ENAMEX>, everybody was muffled up in boots and long
skirts with caps and sweaters, hoping to suggest the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Left Bank</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX>. Through
all such intensely concocted efforts, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year after year</TIMEX>, set ablaze by fierce
lights and lashed at by loud music, rows of tall, beautiful, amiable young
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> stride and pause and turn, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">obligingly</TIMEX> decked in strands of rope, piles of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">feathers</ENAMEX>, patches of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX>, mountains of taffeta. Every once in a while, one or
another will endearingly stumble.

            It wasn't always like
this. Mannequins have paraded in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX>' collections since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn</TIMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, but until <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> their status was low and so was their pay. They
were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> at individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX>, and their job was to resemble
store-window <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dummies</ENAMEX> or the sketchy figures in fashion drawings. The sexual
charms of prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> were on no account to be upstaged by those of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. Mannequins were nameless, their standard good looks as uninteresting
as possible, their erotic selves effaced. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paquin</ENAMEX> around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1913</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> wore
flesh-colored coverings on arms, back, and bosom when they showed décolleté
evening wear, so their bare skin wouldn't be distracting.

            It has remained true that the fashion model's only job is
to appear in clothes; indeed, in the atmosphere in which they shine as
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>, it's all the more important that they have no other
distracting talents. The appeal of these female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">platoons</ENAMEX> is ancient, potent,
and forbidden. They are like rows of whores or slaves, odalisques or
concubines, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Astarte</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demons</ENAMEX> as myriad sirens. They
don't offer intricate performances that took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of severe training to
perfect; they don't sing, speak, or chant; they don't earnestly appear for a
cause; they aren't eagerly joining in a festival. They have no will. They
parade their fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">charms</ENAMEX> in seductive, borrowed plumage for our judgment, but
only for the greater glory of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sultan</ENAMEX>, the high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX>, the whoremaster, the
ringmaster, the devil himself, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backer</ENAMEX> who have bought them
as toys to play with. It's one of the oldest erotic fantasies, recurrent in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">legends</ENAMEX> and fictions of many kinds, lending itself well to traditional ballet
and cabaret--see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scheherezade</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Bayadère</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Folies Bergères</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Copacabana</ENAMEX>.

            We don't allow ourselves to
perceive fashion shows as variations on this particular theme, because it would
force us away from the comfortable notion that fashion is the mirror of our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. But we do know that deep beneath our surface approval of the wholesome
worldwide tide of luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commerce</ENAMEX> that keeps the fashion business
afloat--boosting economies, promoting employment and cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>,
enriching the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> with new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> and the visual arts with new scope--it is
all about sex of a very old-fashioned and dirty-minded kind. What we secretly
like about fashion is seeing it perennially exposed in daring, costly,
ridiculous, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">delicious</ENAMEX>, televised <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">runway</ENAMEX> shows full of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mobile</ENAMEX>, passive, perfect
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">girls</ENAMEX>. Anyone looking for a further proof of the return to barbarism at the end
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this millennium</TIMEX> could probably find it there.
