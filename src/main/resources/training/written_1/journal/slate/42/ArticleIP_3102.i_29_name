            Furs were the first clothes,
stripped off the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts</ENAMEX> that provided food and bone tools. Fur clothes
were strictly utilitarian until <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> learned to spin thread fine enough to
weave into cloth soft enough to drape around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. Once that happened,
maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 7,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, fur worn by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> became both a luxury and a
symbol of wealth and power, and it still is. Fortunately or not, we can never
go back to those artless <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Paleolithic days</TIMEX>.

            But after
millennia of arrogance laced with sensuality for some and awe laced with rancor
for most, fur has been tamed and put in its place. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> swathed in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seal</ENAMEX> and sable are no longer obvious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lords</ENAMEX> of the world, trailing intimidating
allusions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> princes or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">czars</ENAMEX> and their consorts; instead,
they look faintly out-of-date. And those spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in tailored leopard
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coats</ENAMEX>, still found in old movies, have vanished from real life ever since the
idea took hold that exotic fur garments were not just too luxurious but also
bad for the soul and bad for the planet. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX>, the wearer of a big coat
made wholly of fur seems almost to be hiding inside an animal costume,
disguised as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of an endangered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, as it were.

            What looks suitable now is fur in piquant traces,
decorative little sealskin scarves or squirrel trim for hoods or neat fox
collars for coats. All these are very attractive, and marginal enough to
suggest the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wearer</ENAMEX>'s superiority to fashion altogether, in accordance with the
current style. In the same spirit, they can all be jolly fakes. Real is fine;
fake is essentially no different. That's because textile technology has finally
produced a range of synthetic fluff that vies with fur in visual beauty and
tactile lusciousness. Some of this synthetic fiber is wrought into velvet and
its cousins plush and chenille, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> known to be man-made even when made
of silk. In their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, man-made chinchilla and mink don't seem in the least
false.

            Best of
all, now we can have no fur but the image of fur, pictured skins of the rarest
kind with which we can enjoy ourselves in a range of materials. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fur</ENAMEX> has solved
its social and economic identity problem by leaping out of nature and into the
virtual-reality <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">third millennium</TIMEX>. So we can have plastic hair clips or cotton
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potholders</ENAMEX> in zebra skin, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vinyl</ENAMEX>-covered hassocks in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">giraffe pelt</ENAMEX>, soft corduroy
sofa cushions or tough twill suitcases in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger</ENAMEX> fur, and nylon zipper jackets
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dalmatian</ENAMEX> spots for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-year-olds</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cheetah</ENAMEX> spots merge with giraffe spots on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bright</ENAMEX> green or purple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lycra</ENAMEX> stretch pants. I have a tawny silk blouse printed
with a clever blend of black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lace</ENAMEX> and leopard skin. In it I can vaguely
resemble a leopard wearing see-through lingerie, a nice m√©lange of warring
erotic symbols.

            
Iacquired this blouse soon after my adventures
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last August</TIMEX>. I was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Botswana</ENAMEX>, looking at the indigenous wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts</ENAMEX> in their
living flesh and fur, and I came to understand why leopard is the most
desirable of all the fur prints for clothes. It's because of the way a real
leopard behaves. All the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> we saw--spotted, striped, or plain,
wart <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hogs</ENAMEX> and wildebeests no less than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> and antelopes, zebras and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">giraffes</ENAMEX>--were beautiful, with the integrity of physical design and movement
they share with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. But among them, it's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leopard</ENAMEX> who seems to
feel it.

            We saw <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> (they're
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">discreet</ENAMEX>)--a female, we were told. We watched her emerge from a thicket into a
sunlit clearing, and pose. There's no other word for it. She stood perfectly
still, head up, tail in a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">majestic arc</ENAMEX>, while we stared entranced for a full <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX>. Then she paced slowly off as if on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">runway</ENAMEX>, each perfect paw straight
in front of the other, haunches delicately swaying, tail holding its curve,
peerless coat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">glittering</ENAMEX> in the sun. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> said that only the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leopard</ENAMEX> walks
like that--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX> just shamble and clump along. Of course we deeply loved
and respected all those heavy-footed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX>, and all those high-shouldered
cheetahs, too. But the leopard is another thing; and all things considered, we
want to be like her.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> have felt this way
for a very long time. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A week ago</TIMEX> I was looking among the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> antiquities
in the renovated <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre</ENAMEX>, and my eye was caught by a small painted limestone
panel from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nefertiabet</ENAMEX>, who lived and died in the reign of
her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinsman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheops</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2590-2565</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX> The young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">princess</ENAMEX> is shown seated before a
low table, her hands engaged with some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> clad in a long,
clinging, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-shouldered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thierry Mugler</ENAMEX> dress entirely covered with leopard
spots. Well, well, well. This was no real <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>'s pelt. Leopard skins do
appear frequently in ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> art, but as privileged ritual gear, slung
over the shoulders of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> with paws and tail dangling down. No, by golly,
here was a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4,500-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leopard</ENAMEX>-print dress, worthy of being worn for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eternity</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Realm of the Dead</ENAMEX>. I turned my head and saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> next to
me wearing a leopard-print scarf, and I felt a little dizzy. You couldn't
exactly say that leopard print is always in fashion. But you would have to
admit that it's always in force.
