            The death of haute
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">couture</ENAMEX> is a constant refrain of fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>. It has been coming to an
end ever since it started, much like culture in general. What a killing blow
was suffered by haute couture in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first decade of this century</TIMEX>, when
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Press</ENAMEX> was first invited to fashion showings! Its presence would surely
destroy the secrecy between a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> and her dressmaker, which was crucial to
individual distinction. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century later</TIMEX>, the ascent of
ready-to-wear dealt another allegedly fatal stroke to haute couture , as
formal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elegance</ENAMEX> began to look tacky, and ethnic and thrift<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-shop</ENAMEX> gear gained
status. More recently, the street fashion called "grunge" was imitated by
couture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-figure prices, and again, dirges could be heard. One
imagines that discriminating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16 th century</TIMEX> mourned the
death of high fashion in much the same way, when slashed sleeves, grotesquely
imitating the rags of mercenary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>, came into style.

            A few
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby's</ENAMEX> held an auction of haute couture clothes,
accessories, and related materials. Most of the garments belonged to elegant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parisiennes</ENAMEX> whose names and photographs embellished the catalog and who were
selling their dresses to benefit good causes in the manner of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX>.
These clothes dated back to about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX> at the earliest and to the early 1990s
at the latest. A few dresses, shown together in the catalog as a group titled
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Createurs</ENAMEX> ," were nameless as to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>, and dated as far back as
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</TIMEX>. Before the auction I went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby's</ENAMEX>, eager to view such elegant
castoffs at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close</NUMEX> range. You could handle them if you wore the white cotton
gloves provided by the vigilant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, who hastened over whenever you
leaned your nose too near the chiffon or made too broad a gesture toward the
embroidery.

            It's more interesting to see what actual couture clients
ordered and wore than it is to look at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">runway</ENAMEX> numbers worn only by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. One
noticeable fact is that rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, unlike beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, are not all tall
and thin. Displays of historical costume have always revealed the way
fashion-plate chic used to be adapted by clever <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dressmakers</ENAMEX> for the beefy or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dumpy</ENAMEX> or flat-chested, but we're now used to thinking that fashionable bodies
are molded to fit the mode, with the help of individualized exercise,
liposuction, and implants. It's not true, at least not in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. Some of the
garments fitted onto padded mannequins showed that their wearers were of
physical as well as financial substance, and these masterpieces are striking
mainly as imaginative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">triumphs</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> fit and suitability.

            The stuff
was classic in the best sense, lacking quirkiness and full of internal harmony
even when it was daring, always both beautiful and personal. The ensemble that
fetched the highest price--<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$17,250</NUMEX> (advance estimate <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,500-$2,000</NUMEX>; buyer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anonymous</ENAMEX>)--was a formal black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taffeta</ENAMEX>, strapless dress with a matching
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shawl-collared</ENAMEX> jacket designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yves St. Laurent</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian Dior</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX>.
Since it's part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YSL</ENAMEX>'s first collection as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dior</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>, this object has
clear historic value and great elegance, but not much independent life. It
needs a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> inside it, preferably the one for whom it was made--not named in
this case. The same is true of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navy</ENAMEX> wool <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-piece Dior dress that fetched
the next highest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$16,000</NUMEX>, estimate also <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,500-$2,000</NUMEX>; sold to a
private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collector</ENAMEX>), another historical object representing the New Look in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX>
with a close fit, high collar, and richly draped skirt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beautifully</ENAMEX> realized,
very wearable, very simple, it should obviously be worn to lunch, not put on
exhibit. I was glad to hear from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby's</ENAMEX> fashion department
that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> do wear their purchases, prepared to sacrifice currency for
unimpeachable quality.

            Among the named original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>, the most palpably present
in her clothes was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine Deneuve</ENAMEX>, whose magnetic and statuesque beauty was
easy to imagine inhabiting these sweeping YSL <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> dresses. Another was the
dark and impeccable <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parisienne Jacqueline</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comtesse de Ribes</ENAMEX>, herself a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX>, whose masterpiece here must have suited her perfectly. For this
dress, she first coated the torso in high-necked, long-sleeved transparent
black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lace</ENAMEX>. Covering the breasts was a joined pair of black velvet,
diamond-shaped patches, whose bottom points met the top points of a long black
velvet skirt, of which the top edge plunged in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sharp V to the lace-covered
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">navel</ENAMEX> in front, and swept diagonally back in a bigger V to the bottom of the
lace-covered spine. At their top points, the black <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX> were
attached to thin black ribbons that climbed over the shoulders. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> other
ribbons came around from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more rose diagonally from the hips
halfway down the rear plunge, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> converging between the shoulder blades
with a bow. Two more bows appeared on the shoulders and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more
correspondingly at the hips where the lower <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ribbons began. Like almost
everything in the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, this amazing dress combined complexity and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">simplicity</ENAMEX>, sensuality and decorum, refined wit and strong impact. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>
haute couture has been famous for achieving this combination for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, solidly backed up by visibly inventive tailoring and visibly exquisite
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fabrics</ENAMEX> and craftsmanship. The result is an undeniable beauty whatever the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mode</ENAMEX>, a beauty specifically meant to render the individual wearer beautiful,
too.

            By contrast, the current show
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fashion Institute of Technology</ENAMEX>, called "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fashion: The New</ENAMEX>
Look to Now," mainly focuses on the impact of the garments themselves. The
show, an instructive panorama of shifting taste in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last half-century</TIMEX> seen
through the innovative work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> interspersed with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> examples, demonstrates how changing
perceptions of high fashion have slowly altered its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fifty years ago</TIMEX>,
the close-range visual value of haute couture clothes emphasized their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rarity</ENAMEX> and the rarity of their wearers, faintly implying that they were all
hereditary nobility in the daily habit of entering well-appointed, finely
proportioned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>. Fashion shows were designed as exclusive events. Fashion
photography aided that impression with formal views of nameless, thoroughbred
models. Since then, all fashion has gradually become a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of popular
entertainment that involves everybody in its creation of vast revenues, through
carefully fostered connections with all kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX> and fantasy.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Designers</ENAMEX>
like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Galliano</ENAMEX> have the media image of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star performers</ENAMEX>. The clothes, too,
have the fantasy look of things not made with hands, things always more
fleetingly pungent or allusive than they are authoritatively beautiful, visions
that float across the TV screen on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> of the fantasy figures for whom
they have been designed, costumes for one performance. Just as with actual
costumes, the deep thought and careful work are undiscernible and no part of
the appeal; everything must look easily conjured up and as easily swept away.
photos suggest the same thing, with nonthoroughbred <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> lolling and
crumpling their clothes as they gaze straight at you, a strap slipping down,
unless they're poised in fragile tinseled drapes and staring from under dream
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">headgear</ENAMEX>. Fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> covering the couture are careful to explain the
precise tailoring and the deft application of the paillettes, since most of it
isn't meant to register on the scanning gaze. The throwaway aspect of popular
inexpensive fashion, now normal since nobody learns to sew, has lent its look
to the costly couture, which more and more seems incompletely imagined and only
half realized.

            But real quality does show at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close</NUMEX> range. At FIT there is
a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> hooded and trained evening dress by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Azzedine Alaia</ENAMEX>, made of slinky green
acetate knit that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">molds</ENAMEX> the body better than a glove, with similarly canny
curved seaming. Set into one of these audacious seams is a zipper that begins
between the breasts, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX> up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over one</NUMEX> shoulder, slithers diagonally down
across the back and swoops forward <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over one</NUMEX> hipbone to continue diagonally
downward in front again ... darling, help me with my zipper, won't you? At any
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distance</ENAMEX>, it's invisible on this sleek <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sea creature</ENAMEX>.

            Evidence accumulates that the
creation of sartorial beauty will never end. It will only shift ground. Talent
will arise to cut anew and drape afresh, to hang the mirror in another place,
to unsettle us again and again, and to keep reclothing us and righting our
minds.
