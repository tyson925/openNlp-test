            "I have a very clear memory
of the meeting," declares one central <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s
ongoing sexual and legal battles, "and I told the truth."

            "I proceeded to explain to
[ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Isikoff</ENAMEX>]," says another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> (onetime <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathleen</ENAMEX>
Willey <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julie Hiatt Steele</ENAMEX>), "that Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willey</ENAMEX> had asked me to lie to
support her version of the event, and that I had, in fact, done so."

            "There are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who talk a
lot," observes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William H.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ginsburg</ENAMEX>), "and as part of that scenario, peccadilloes, they may tell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fibs</ENAMEX>,
lies, exaggerations, oversell."

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
Today , summing up the experience of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two months</TIMEX>, asked in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">headline</ENAMEX>, "Who can claim truth or objectivity anymore<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>"

            Ah, that old question. "What is truth?" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">demanded Pontius</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">18:38</TIMEX>) during his interrogation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>. He received no reply.
Perhaps because it is less accessible, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least</NUMEX> less prevalent, the act of
truth telling has garnered far less attention in popular speech than the act of
lying. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Roget</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thesaurus</ENAMEX> , words associated with falsity outnumber
those associated with veracity by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 5-to-1</NUMEX>. Synonyms for truth telling are
formal and dull: candor , honesty , veridity . Those for
conveying falsehoods are colorful and ebullient: equivocation ,
mythomania , casuistry , quackery , buncombe ,
cajolery , duplicity , perjury , bamboozlement ,
pettifoggery , sugarcoating , a crock , a con job ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twaddle</ENAMEX> .

            The
gravitational pull of falsity is so powerful that even words and phrases that
start out as truth <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reinforcers</ENAMEX> tend, over time, to acquire the opposite
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">connotation</ENAMEX>. Who is not immediately put on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> when confronted with
statements introduced by "Frankly ...," "To be perfectly honest
...," or "The fact of the matter is ..."? When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ginsburg</ENAMEX> described
certain testimony as being "totally reliable ," the words were served up
in press accounts (as, unavoidably, they also are here) within an isolated
setting of quotation marks, which function as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage wink</ENAMEX>. The ostensible
truth multiplier <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1,000 percent</NUMEX> (from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George McGovern</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX> avowal of
support for his running mate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas F. Eagleton</ENAMEX>, whom he claimed to support
"<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1,000 percent</NUMEX>" and then summarily dropped from the ticket) is now an ironic
synonym for "don't bet on it" or even "not on your life."

            
In much the same way, categorical
denials have suffered an irreversible erosion of face value, owing to their
routine issuance by bombastic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>, aggrieved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">miscreants</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of liberation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> and international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>.
( Categorical denial , with its serration of easy consonants and regularly
spaced vowels, seems to be within pronunciation range of all non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>.) Once intended to endow a denial with the qualities of pervasiveness
and totality, the adjective categorical ("absolute," "unqualified,"
"explicit") now raises doubts and eyebrows. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">screenwriter</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Lasdun</ENAMEX>'s recent protestation--"I categorically deny being a
neo-formalist"--<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> the suspicion that his sympathies are, indeed,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neoformalist</ENAMEX>. Responding to rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> was planning to add new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> to the classic animated film <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snow White</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> declared, "I categorically deny that we would ever touch <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snow</ENAMEX>
White ."

            Still,
the idea of "category" as it applies to lies is worth exploring--and leads into
the realm of theology. Say what one will about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> theology, it offers a
cosmological taxonomy in which all things have an appointed place and a
well-thought-out definition, rendered with lapidary minimalism. Truth ,
for instance, is helpfully defined in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Encyclopedia</ENAMEX> as the
"accordance or conformity between what is asserted and what is," or "the
conformity of intellection with being." Falsity , in turn, is the
"deformity of intellection and being."

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weeks ahead</TIMEX> it will be important to maintain clear
theological distinctions (per the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Encyclopedia</ENAMEX> ) among various kinds of
lies. There is the mendacium jocosum --the "lie told in jest." A second
type of lie is the mendacium officiosum , or "officious lie," whose
purpose is to achieve some useful end or to prevent some distinct harm.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Examples</ENAMEX> might include a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> misleading a terminally ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> or a
prisoner lying to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy interrogators</ENAMEX>.) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> type of lie is the mendacium
perniciosum , or "pernicious lie," a lie that is intended to do harm.

            A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>
type of lie might be called the mendacium universalis , the "universal or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">endemic</ENAMEX> lie." This is the type of lie--if it is, indeed, a lie--that we seem to
be encountering most frequently <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>. If a lie, by definition, becomes a
lie only in the context of communication (speech, writing, gesture), and if a
lie is immoral because it destroys the fundamental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> that makes
communication possible--if all this is so, can a lie be told in a context where
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> is understood to have no objective value to begin with? I give
the floor back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theologians</ENAMEX>:

            In the
extremely difficult situations being considered, there is no mutual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> or
confidence to destroy. In fact, a maximum of distrust prevails between the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, and no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in such a position could prudently take the words of the
other at their face value. In such a case, words would cease, to a degree, to
be a medium for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of thought. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communication</ENAMEX> would be broken down,
and to the extent in which communication of mind with mind has become
impossible, it would be equally impossible to realize the idea of a lie. ...
[It] seems incontestable that if no communication in the ordinary sense of the
word is possible, there can be no lie.

            
Not all falsehoods, of course, are lies (the
key ingredient in a lie is intentionality). Nor are all lies deceptions--some
lies are told without any intention to deceive ("You've lost weight!" "Let's do
lunch!"). Moreover, some deceptions are, technically, not lies, theologically
speaking: "A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> could tell a truth with sufficient clarity to avoid making
a false statement and sufficient ambiguity and evasiveness to avoid revealing a
truth which he wants to keep hidden." (For instance, if you're a presidential
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> and are asked if you have ever smoked marijuana, and you have, but
only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, you might reply that you have broken no state laws.) A
statement that successfully picks its way across this dangerous terrain is said
to exhibit an economy of truth , and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who has uttered such a
statement is said to have been economical with the truth . These
characterizations, too, were originally conferred with a sense of professional
appreciation (I first heard them on the lips of some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jesuit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>), but they
have also been pulled out of truth's orbit and into the atmosphere of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mendacity</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> an economy of truth sometimes just means "a lie,"
albeit one whose seriousness may be debatable. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julie Burchill</ENAMEX> wrote recently in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian</ENAMEX> , "The idea that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> has to overcome the 'natural'
resistance of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> to sexual intercourse by a combination of gifts
and being economical with the truth takes us perilously near to
date-rape territory."

            The concept of an

               <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX> of truth may have lost its purity, but it retains considerable
utility. If nothing else, it adds a timely new dimension to the hortatory
reminder "It's the economy, stupid."
