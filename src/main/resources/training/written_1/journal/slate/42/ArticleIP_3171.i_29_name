            The news that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX> have successfully cloned an adult female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>, bringing forth a young
female named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dolly</ENAMEX>, has raised questions of considerable public urgency, the
most troubling of which in my own mind is: Dolly? The cells from which Dolly
was cloned, it turns out, were taken from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>'s ample mammary glands. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryologist</ENAMEX> who obtained the cells was reminded of the full-figured
country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dolly Parton</ENAMEX>. Such are the improbable byways of on the wintry
Caledonian moors.

            A more
substantial issue raised by the advent of cloning (itself from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
klon , meaning "twig" or "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>") is, of course, the possibility that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commerce</ENAMEX> in the very stuff of which we're made will ultimately turn humanity
into merchandise, our genesis controlled by some mutant form of agribusiness.
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Turning People Into Product</ENAMEX>" was the headline above a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
commentary by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brent Staples</ENAMEX> that evoked, among other things, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science</ENAMEX>-fictional prospect of "the wholesale manufacture of synthetic human
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX>."

            The word was apt. Product in this collective sense,
used without an article, has none of the quantitative, formative, or even
poetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> that the word had otherwise acquired--as in "gross national
product," "a product of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Groton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>," or "the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and product of his
labors past" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dryden</ENAMEX>). It is used, rather, as a white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slaver</ENAMEX> might speak of
"flesh."

            

               Product as a generic mercantile term for "marketable commodity" has been
around for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, but it seems to have first acquired prominence as jargon--and
specifically as a term with a somewhat off-putting aroma--in the recording
industry during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>. In his book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rock Gold: The Music</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Millionaires</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Tremlett</ENAMEX> observes that "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the music business
always talk about [music] with one word that you hardly ever see mentioned in
the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Product</ENAMEX> . Sound recordings may be technically superb,
with all the benefits of the latest digital electronics, but it's only 'good'
Product, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'live' Product</ENAMEX>, or 'strong' Product if it sells. Otherwise it's 'dead'
Product."

            
Product has since come to encompass all aspects
of the entertainment world, and the cynicism it once embodied is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> only
occasionally highlighted by means of its presentation in quotation marks.
Employed matter-of-factly, even unself-consciously, product is perhaps
now found most often in connection with the motion-picture industry. "This
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nominees</ENAMEX>," wrote one newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> recently, after noting that a
single big-studio movie was in the running for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oscar</ENAMEX> for best picture,
"represent a triumph of independent films over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> product." Another
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">critic</ENAMEX> says of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quentin Tarantino</ENAMEX>, "He has been acclaimed for some
of the most hollow product ever to pass itself off as art."

            

               Product in the entertainment-industry sense used above occupies a
distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> within the phylum content . Whereas product is, for
the most part, a commodity that exists or is envisaged, content , in its
most advanced and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> most widely used sense, means the totality of all
substance (in particular, commercially viable substance) that can be made
available through the various communications and information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>: not just
movies, TV shows, and music but also software, games, sports, news,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">directories</ENAMEX>, advertising, and everything online--now and in the future.

            When content is used this way, both the specific
source or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX> and its medium of transmission are irrelevant to its
definition, much as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> and medium of transmission are irrelevant to a
definition of the word heat . In a recent e-mail communication, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse T. Sheidlower</ENAMEX> writes:

            
               I added this to the
forthcoming edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">College Dictionary</ENAMEX> , but it
took a tremendous amount of effort to define. We argued about what it really
means and sent drafts back and forth for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week</TIMEX> before we arrived at the
following definition which (like all definitions that one struggles with) looks
perfectly innocuous and simple: "content n. ... substantive information or
creative material viewed in contrast to its actual or potential manner of
presentation."
            

            This is
the meaning of content in the cloying phrase "content is king," the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mantra</ENAMEX> repeated endlessly by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX> and other multimedia conquistadors.
"The dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> are bigger than ever and have more control than
ever," the media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> and former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bagdikian</ENAMEX> said recently in a newspaper interview. "What they are aiming
for--and have gone a long way toward achieving--is to control the origination
of content and the natural delivery system."

            The same content appears in the term content
provider . Although at first used to designate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>--which scour the universe for mat√©riel to give
life and purpose to their distribution <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>--the term has been trickling
down to apply to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. "We like to think of ourselves as content
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX>," I heard a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cleric</ENAMEX> say recently about his line of work, a comment
that I took to be knowingly ironic but which could also have been a sincere and
pathetic attempt to be with it. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> talk presents this problem often.) The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX> and multimedia performer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurie Anderson</ENAMEX> now calls herself a content
provider:

            
               At first, I thought,
"That's one of the grossest things I've ever heard." And then I thought about
it, and I go, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Well</ENAMEX>, that's not really horrible." In fact, I eventually started
to like it. Every time I renew my passport--"content <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX>," I put that
right in.
            

            The big issue with content
is, of course: Who owns it? Information is the resource-extractive industry of
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next century</TIMEX>, and the concept of intellectual property --a term that
dates back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">150 years</TIMEX>--comes up when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> assert a
particular claim and embody it in the form of copyrights, trademarks, and
patents. Intellectual property refers, basically, to nontangible
creative product and, like a rising sea, it seems to cover new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> with
every passing year. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Basketball Association</ENAMEX> has famously sought to
trademark the scores of its games. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harley-Davidson</ENAMEX> has sought to trademark the
rumble of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motorcycles</ENAMEX>. Patents can even be held on the genetic blueprints
of various forms of life.

            In biotechnology, as in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telecommunications</ENAMEX>, intellectual-property law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> at an embryonic stage.
But it is not premature to begin thinking of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dolly</ENAMEX>'s ovine progenitor not so
much as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>--or even as product--but, in some sense, as content. In her
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clone</ENAMEX>'s eyes, of course, she will always be a significant udder.
