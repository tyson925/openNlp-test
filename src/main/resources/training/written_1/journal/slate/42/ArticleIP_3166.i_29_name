            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economics</ENAMEX> is notoriously
imperfect in its assessment of human behavior. "If all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> were laid
end to end," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bernard Shaw</ENAMEX> once observed, "they would not reach a
conclusion." Economic terms and concepts, on the other hand, have been absorbed
into ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX>, mainly for their sheer descriptive power.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gresham's Law</ENAMEX> ("bad money drives out good money") has been widely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to matters of culture and taste--for instance, in explanations of why
television is awash in vulgar programming. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laissez-faire</ENAMEX> is now used to
describe a variety of "anything-goes" regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regimes</ENAMEX>, whether in law or
child-rearing. Gold standard does duty for "the last word" in any field
of endeavor or line of consumer goods. Diminishing returns , economy
of scale , invisible hand , opportunity cost --all appear
commonly in noneconomic settings. There is a supply side , it seems, to
almost everything.

            To this
list one can add a pair of complementary economic terms that is emerging from
strictly technical usage into everyday patois--the one an old standby that is
newly diversifying, the other its mirror image, just beginning to find a
public.

            According to the textbooks, value-added is "the
amount of value added to a product by each stage of its production"--in other
words, the amount of value added as wood metamorphoses from tree to lumber to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX>, or as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> is refined from its captured state into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">petrochemicals</ENAMEX>, and
thence, perhaps, into plastic. During the brief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Forbes</ENAMEX> epoch of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> primary <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, the idea of a "value-added tax" received
glancing attention. The tax, conceived around the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX> and now
in use across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>, is imposed on each increment of growth in
value during a commodity's industrial transformation.

            In recent
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, the term value-added has dallied with marketing to produce a new
brood of connotations. In the food industry, value-added has long meant
"processed." Or, it can refer to any product that includes some special feature
or extra component. (A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lettuce</ENAMEX> is not value-added , but
washed-and-cut <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lettuce</ENAMEX> in a plastic bag is. So is hamburger already made into
patties, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> that has been shredded, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-percent-pure orange juice
that comes in a container with a screw top.) Putting words such as "healthy,"
"lite," or "fresh" on a label can offer value-added cachet.

            
Outside the food industry, promotional tie-ins
of almost any kind are deemed value-added --T-shirts, tote bags,
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">contests, 800</ENAMEX> numbers, Web sites, and all the other ingredients of the vast
commercial agglomeration known as "marketainment." Even values impart
value-added worth. Here is a blurb for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s cartoon Big
Bag : " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'Big Bag</ENAMEX>' casts itself as a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">modern-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Aesop</ENAMEX> by focusing each
episode on honesty, cooperation, and other value-added themes."

            

               Value-added may also have a future as a concept invoked to justify what
might otherwise seem like casual appropriation. A recent article in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Journalism Review</ENAMEX> contained the following passage:

            
               Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adler</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> often gets its ideas from 'little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">like The New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Atlantic Monthly</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harper</ENAMEX>'s, and 'with our reporting resources
we can package them for a larger market. ... There's some value-added in what
we do.'
            

            When
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Britain</ENAMEX> next comes under criticism for having absconded with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elgin</ENAMEX>
Marbles from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX>, we should expect their prominent display in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Museum</ENAMEX> to be brought up as part of a value-added defense.

            The opposite of value-addition , of course, is
value-subtraction . In this process, the value of raw economic inputs is
not enhanced but somehow diminished with each step in its manufacturing or
marketing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign-affairs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Luttwak</ENAMEX> has illustrated the
phenomenon as it pertains to the manufacture of late-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Marxist</ENAMEX> apparel:

            
               Perfectly good Uzbek
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cotton</ENAMEX> that had real value--it could be sold on the world market--was made into
shirts so ugly and poorly cut that not even <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> would buy them.
Hence all that spinning, weaving, dyeing, cutting, and sewing actually removed
value from the raw materials.
            

            Although
the term value-subtracted has been used in specialized contexts for some
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, it is acquiring traction in public parlance largely because of
dislocations in the former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">bloc</ENAMEX>. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> study estimated that some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s industrial output at the time was being produced by
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> that even <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> called value-subtractors . The study
noted that the collapse of value-subtracting industries can precipitate
an economic boon. By <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> estimate, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s economic output would more than
double if the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> simply sold off their natural resources instead of
trying to make something out of them. ("That is why," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economist</ENAMEX>
observed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX>, in its trademark tone of languorous hauteur, "when a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> steel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> reduces output, it is an achievement, not a pity.")

            
Look for value-subtracted to establish
itself in metaphorically expansive circumstances. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Gilder</ENAMEX> now
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">speaks of America</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> as "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> of value subtraction"--parasites that
suck social and economic vitality from the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Some management
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> describe dysfunctional interactions with one's fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> as
value-subtracting behavior. Whatever they may be called in private,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> who demand an inordinate amount of time, money, and morale (and we
have all stood behind them at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>) have acquired the name
value-subtractors .

            We nod to
the idea of value-subtraction whenever we fall back on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horace</ENAMEX>'s phrase
about "laboring to bring forth a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>," or lament the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX> felled to make
possible a terrible book, or recollect an experience of working by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>.
The idea that value may decrease as a result of the very efforts made to
increase it is an essential part of human experience, and it will ensure
value-subtraction --in its value-added sense--a long and
distinguished career.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Afterthoughts</ENAMEX> and follow-up:
            

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> responded to
the last "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Word"</ENAMEX> column, on yadda yadda yadda . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of them, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gelmis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Zacks</ENAMEX>, independently remembered the expression from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenny</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX> routine, which itself was a parody of dialogue in a prison movie. As
Gelmis remembers it, the expression comes up in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX> that occur after a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocky</ENAMEX> has precipitated a riot:

            Warden: "Give it up,
Rocky!"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocky</ENAMEX>: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yadda</ENAMEX>, yadda, yadda , warden."<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flotsky</ENAMEX>: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domini</ENAMEX>,
domini, domini, you're all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholics</ENAMEX>. OK, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocky</ENAMEX>, now be a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> and give
yourself up."<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocky</ENAMEX>: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yadda</ENAMEX>, yadda, yadda , fadda."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Pauw</ENAMEX> provided a reference to a song, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yah-ta-ta</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yah-ta-ta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yah-ta-ta</ENAMEX>," recorded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy Garland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bing Crosby</ENAMEX>. ("The
theme of the song," he wrote, "is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> boring each other with talk, talk,
talk.") Various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> offered citations from the television shows The
Simpsons , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearl</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grace</ENAMEX> 
               Under 
               Fire . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fredericksen</ENAMEX> noted that expressions other than yadda yadda yadda used by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> to generate "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> chatter" in theater productions include
rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX> 'n' carrots, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX> 'n' carrots, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX> 'n'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carrots</ENAMEX>; and watermelon, watermelon, watermelon .

            A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> noted that
a phonetic yadda yadda , no etymological relation to the term under
discussion, is commonly heard in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> as an expression roughly synonymous with
"yuck."
