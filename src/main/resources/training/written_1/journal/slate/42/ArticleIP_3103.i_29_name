            Figure skating began to
captivate me and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> when we were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. We watched <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonja Henie</ENAMEX> in the
movies, we were taken to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> shows, we took lessons, and we had strong views
about what we wished to wear while practicing our axels at the public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rink</ENAMEX>.
Figure skating wasn't a real sport, comradely and combative like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s ice
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hockey</ENAMEX>, which we played in boring skates and unlovely clothes on a frozen pond.
It was a romantic and competitive display, emphatically a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> thing. Adorable
outfits were a large part of the whole idea.

            They obviously still
are, and not just for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>. My interest in skating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">withered</ENAMEX> and died before I
was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>, but my evergreen interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfits</ENAMEX> keeps me staring avidly at what is
being worn on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Winter Olympics</ENAMEX>, even though I now lack much grasp
of the rules of the game. I mainly notice that things have come a long way
since I was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. Classic figure skating is now complicated by the development of
sensational ice dancing in several categories. The old-fashioned romantic
display has been profitably invigorated with sex, fashion, and progressive
technical excitement, to say nothing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unceasing soap</ENAMEX>-operatic drama played
out among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> and spun out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX>'s costumes have shed all fake-Nordic
touches suggesting conventional <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> or conventional cuteness. Gone are the
red-lined, black-velvet circular skirts worn with flower-embroidered, white
sweaters; the long-sleeved, tight jackets with fur trim at neck and wrists; the
little fur hats and snug bonnets. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ice</ENAMEX> isn't cold any more--it's hot. Costumes
suggest the disco dance floor or the hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ballroom</ENAMEX>, except when they're
suggesting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick</ENAMEX>'s of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> catalog, high-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>, or
outer space.

            Most notable is the way
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s costumes for this quasisport have largely kept their dignity, while
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s have burst into hysterics. The physical risks have become very great
for male ice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX>, but their clothes stay conservative. When they don't,
scathing commentary appears in the press. The young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> gold medalist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ilya</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kulik</ENAMEX> got raves for his dazzling skating and nothing but scorn for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yellow</ENAMEX>-and-black giraffe-print shirt he wore, with more scorn for the gauzy
wings on the abstractly designed torso of his other costume. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Artur Dmitriev</ENAMEX>,
another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> gold medalist, also got negative press for his plunging
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neckline</ENAMEX> and wrapped sash, apparently too outrageous for pairs skating. The
ghost of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vaslav Nijinsky</ENAMEX> seems to haunt these young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> in their search
for supreme skill at multiple turns in midair and in their willingness to wear
brilliant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-ballet</ENAMEX> gear.

            
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian Ballet</ENAMEX> convention for male costume
was established all over the world in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last century</TIMEX>, and it allowed any sort
of glorious finery above the waist, even with long, plain legs below. Later,
under the innovative direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sergei Diaghilev, Nijinsky</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rose</ENAMEX>" and
"Faun" costumes, among others, gave rise to a host of abstract creations for
the male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. These have appeared on the dance stage throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX>,
and are now to be seen on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Damien Woetzel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Morris</ENAMEX>, and others. But none of
this imaginative freedom seems to have reached the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>, except on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX>.

            On the other hand, a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">couple of weeks ago</TIMEX> the costume of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Frenchman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe Candeloro</ENAMEX> alluded to the
tradition of theater rather than that of dance. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candeloro</ENAMEX> also avoided
prolonged whirls in midair, offering some dashing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17 th</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> mimed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">swordplay</ENAMEX> instead. Thigh-high black boots rose startlingly up from his skates,
set off by a laced-up white doublet with big slashed sleeves and a big collar.
His long hair and mustache, his black gloves, and his sturdy, buff-clad behind
made his leaps and lunges most historical, the whole thing being quite rare for
a free-style skating solo. He called it "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D'Artagnan</ENAMEX>," but it could have been
Cyrano, or anybody in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moli√®re.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> was gaudily invoked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days later</TIMEX>
by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> doing "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Romeo and Juliet</ENAMEX>" in matching bright blue, bejeweled
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> outfits.

            
But in most cases the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ballroom</ENAMEX> convention
governs the clothes for traditional pairs skating and affects ice dancing too,
keeping male ice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> looking fairly sober. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX>'s skating costumes are
strictly simple and symmetrical, beginning with long, black trousers that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">invoke Fred Astaire</ENAMEX>, even when worn with a loose, rolled-sleeved, open-necked
black shirt, or with various <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Star Trek</ENAMEX> effects above the waist. Male
skating costume, like male evening dress, is still meant to offset the
fantastic extremes of the women's costumes, which run to exposure, asymmetry,
and fluttering ornament, just like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ginger Rogers</ENAMEX>' dancing dresses in the early
1930s. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sparkles</ENAMEX> now seem OK for everything, even for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s black pants and neat
jackets. Metallic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fabric</ENAMEX>, rhinestones, or sequins may coat both him and her,
the better to mesmerize us equally as we track them flashing past. Not for
skates, though--no glitz on the business end.

            There is an astonishing
array of inventions in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s costumes, where all the most dangerous aesthetic
risks are currently being taken. But some things are constant. For pairs
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">skating</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s skates must be white, and unfortunately very big. These used
to look fine with fur-trimmed jackets, but they look quite different with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mini</ENAMEX>-ball-dresses or virtual underwear, and they looked grotesque on tiny
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oksana Baiul</ENAMEX> in her pink swan-queen outfit at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lillehammer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>--the
too-direct reference to traditional ballet suddenly made her skates look
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ungainly</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> dancing, skates are often flesh-colored to match the tights,
and the leg may sweep all the way to the end.

            Costumes have more scope,
however; some tend toward approximations of current fashion, with many
ponytails, little bandeaux under boleros, and several bare midriffs, along with
S&M trappings in better or worse arrangements, and a range of recent and
remote historical allusions. Whatever the costume, it must go with tights and
skates, it should enhance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">skater</ENAMEX>'s performance, and the rules say it must
have a skirt. But this can mean <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> panels fore and aft, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> overlapping
panels, a flippy circle, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">foot-long</NUMEX> sheath with a slit, a stiff <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6-inch</NUMEX> flange,
a knee-length drift of chiffon. Above the waist, we might see an asymmetrical
patch of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salmon</ENAMEX> pink and another of black making <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> breast look heavy and the
other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> look absent; or we can see the simple black-velvet scoop-neck top
above the fluttering yellow silk skirt worn by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oksana Kazakova</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> colors
perfectly balanced by the two flashing white skates below. A dress in any
bright single color tends to be great; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> colors in several patchy sections
tends to be dreadful, especially when mixed with patches of bare skin. Slanted
hemlines are bad; slit skirts are good. A ponytail with a lot of feathers or
fluff holding it together is no good; hair that neatly caps the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, whether
in a bob or a bun, is very good. Anything that looks as if it might get in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>'s mouth and eyes or slap his face is bad; any material that caresses
the thighs is better than a fabric that smacks them. I could go on; but I'll
wait until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next winter</TIMEX>.
