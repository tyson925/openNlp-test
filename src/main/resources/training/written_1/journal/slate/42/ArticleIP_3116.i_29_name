            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo da Vinci</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> at painting, no
doubt about it. He invented <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sfumato</ENAMEX>, inaugurated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High Renaissance</ENAMEX>, and
created what is arguably the cleverest composition in the history of art,
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Last Supper</ENAMEX> .

            Was he also a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science</ENAMEX>? The casual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> to the current exhibition of the Codex
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leicester</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Museum of Natural History</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> (through
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 1, 1997</TIMEX>) might come away with the vague impression that he was. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX> describe the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>-page manuscript, on loan to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX>
(who bought it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30.8 million</NUMEX>), as "a masterpiece of science."
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the catalog <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">essayists</ENAMEX> writes that "[a]s a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo</ENAMEX> rates more
space in the reputable <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Scientific Biography than Kepler</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einstein</ENAMEX> combined."

            But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo</ENAMEX> was not a genius the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einstein</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX>
was. He was more a genius the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buckminster Fuller</ENAMEX> was, if that is a way of
being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX>.

            For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of centuries</TIMEX>
after his death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1519</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo</ENAMEX> was seen mainly as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>, albeit a
preternaturally gifted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. His artistic legacy comprises the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mona Lisa</ENAMEX>
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> other paintings (several of them unfinished), together with a treatise
on painting. But he had also left behind <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 7,000</NUMEX> pages of unpublished notes
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hydraulics</TIMEX>, geology, anatomy, flight, ballistics, botany, optics, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">astronomy</ENAMEX>, as well as designs for all sorts of fantastical inventions. It was
not until the time of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Industrial Revolution</ENAMEX> that his notebooks, by then
scattered all over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, were paid serious attention. Soon, he was being
celebrated for his "precursive" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX>. He had beaten <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newton</ENAMEX> to the theory of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gravity</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Copernicus</ENAMEX> to heliocentrism. He had worked out the circulation of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Harvey</ENAMEX>. He had grasped the principle of erosion more
completely than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georges Cuvier</ENAMEX>. He had invented the airplane, the tank, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bicycle</ENAMEX>, the modern toilet--such are the claims that have been made for
him.

            What is the evidence for such deep originality in the
Codex 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leicester</ENAMEX> ? The manuscript itself, whose pages are dimly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illumined</ENAMEX> in a series of glass cases at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, is not, at first blush, a
fetching object. You can't exactly read the thing, since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo</ENAMEX>'s jottings
are in medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, and are rendered in his famous mirror-image script.
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of marginal drawings have some aesthetic interest--especially
those depicting the flow of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>--but they are mainly simple geometrical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagrams</ENAMEX> and doodles. The earls of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leicester</ENAMEX>, who owned the codex since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1717</TIMEX>,
seem rarely to have looked at it. "Nothing like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three centuries</TIMEX> of aristocratic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incuriousity</ENAMEX> to keep ink and paper in near-perfect condition," commented one
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wag</ENAMEX>. (Between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leicesters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX>, the notebook was owned for a dozen
or so <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Armand Hammer</ENAMEX>--who, with his unerring flair for the ludicrous,
insisted it be called the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Codex Hammer</ENAMEX> and claimed that he had retained
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">squad</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite commandos</ENAMEX> trained in kung fu and armed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uzis</ENAMEX> to guard it
round the clock.)

            Looking at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
translation of the codex on a CD-ROM at the exhibit, I saw that what began as
an attempt by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo</ENAMEX> to set down the first principles of the behavior of
water ended up as a farrago of observations and musings--fanciful, insightful,
analytically maddening. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point, for example, he notes that the higher a
column of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, the greater the pressure it exerts--a valid, if unexciting,
conclusion. But elsewhere in the codex, he maintains that only moving
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> produces pressure at the bottom, reasoning that the still water of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pond</ENAMEX>, after all, does not press down the grasses that grow on the bottom. Not
only is this breathtakingly wrongheaded, it contradicts the previous
principle.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo</ENAMEX>'s greatest shortcoming as a scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thinker</ENAMEX>
was, not paradoxically, his greatest strength as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>: his eye. This, for
him, was the ultimate epistemic instrument, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to be trusted over all
classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>. "Do you not see that the eye embraces the beauty of the
whole world?" he wrote, insisting that the visual eye was, pre-eminently, the
real. It is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo</ENAMEX>'s sheer ability to see --to notice, in a way that no
one had before, precisely what it looks like when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> streams of water
merge--that accounts for the thrilling <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> of the Codex

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leicester</ENAMEX> .

            The problem was that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo</ENAMEX> knew very little mathematics. Algebra was a closed book to him, and he
was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> at figures. (When he writes, "Let no one read me who is not a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mathematician</ENAMEX>," he is using the term loosely, to suggest a rigorous cast of
mind.) His ocular observations were in a qualitative vein, hearkening back to
Aristotelian science rather than forward to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newton</ENAMEX>. That is fine when it comes,
say, to anatomy--in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo</ENAMEX> was also well-served by his willingness to
thrust his nicely manicured hands into the guts of dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">felons</ENAMEX> he was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dissecting</ENAMEX>. But it's disastrous in dynamics, where his experiments led him to
conclude that both the velocity of a falling object and the distance fallen are
proportional to the time of the fall--which a moment's reflection exposes as a
logical absurdity. (The only other figure I can think of who had similar claims
to genius both in art and science, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Goethe</ENAMEX>, was also a mathematical innocent.
But where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo</ENAMEX> had a keen respect for mathematics, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goethe</ENAMEX> was openly
contemptuous of it.) The true precursor of the scientific revolution was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX>, who proclaimed, with almost mystical conviction, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Book of</ENAMEX>
Nature was written in the language of mathematics.

            As for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo</ENAMEX>'s "inventions," those that were sound from
an engineering point of view were usually borrowed from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contemporaries</ENAMEX>. His
elaborate hoists and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cranes</ENAMEX> were designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brunelleschi</ENAMEX>, his engines of war
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Konrad Keyser</ENAMEX>, his "automobile" by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sienese Francesco</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">di Giorgio Martini</ENAMEX>. (On the other hand, a device described in the Codex
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leicester</ENAMEX> that, the exhibition catalogue notes, "sounds curiously similar
to a modern espresso machine," seems entirely original.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo</ENAMEX>'s "flying
machine" would not have flown, but that hardly counts against its visual
bravura; one version resembled a calabash shell crossed with a windmill, and
another, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-winged <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterfly</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who, according to one
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biographer</ENAMEX>, "was plunged into a kind of ecstasy by devising never-ending
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> of cogwheels and screws"--rather like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buckminster Fuller</ENAMEX> deliriously
multiplying geodesics.

            If there was a bit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fuller in Leonardo</ENAMEX>, there was
also a bit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberace</ENAMEX> in this theatrical, high-living dandy who favored
brocade doublets and bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> with pretty faces. (Since his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disciples</ENAMEX> were
chosen for their looks, he had no distinguished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successors</ENAMEX>.) Little of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo</ENAMEX>'s weirdness is conveyed by the Codex 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leicester</ENAMEX>
exhibit--though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella Rosellini</ENAMEX>'s blue-velveteen voice narrating the
exhibit's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight-minute</TIMEX> biographical video helps somewhat. Here was a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> humanist who regarded his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> as "stupid and deranged,"
"sacks for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>," and "fillers-up of privies," and relished the thought of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">humanity</ENAMEX>'s destruction in a universal deluge. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo</ENAMEX>'s obsession with
swirling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>--which found scientific expression in the Codex

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leicester</ENAMEX> and sublime artistic expression in the drawings he did toward
the end of his life--could be pretty morbid.
