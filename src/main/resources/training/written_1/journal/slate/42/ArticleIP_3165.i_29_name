            In an opening monologue not
long ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Late Night</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Leno</ENAMEX> told his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX>
had hit a patch of turbulence during a recent trip, forcing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
to return the flight attendant "to her full upright and locked position."

            What
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> of the future may find most notable about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leno</ENAMEX>'s joke is not
what it says about popular perceptions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>'s sex life, but what it
says about the language of air travel, and how its sui-generis vocabulary
("seat pocket," "ground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>," "emergency flotation"), its stilted
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constructions</ENAMEX> ("We are now ready to pre-board those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> who ..."), its
sometimes counterintuitive rhythms and emphases ("The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> has turned
off the seat-belt sign. ..."), its unblinking, look-you-in-the-eye reliance on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">euphemisms</ENAMEX> ("In the unlikely event of a water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">landing</ENAMEX> ..."), its blas√©
invocation of an all-enveloping legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> ("We remind you that it is a
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offense</ENAMEX> to tamper with, disable, or destroy any lavatory smoke
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detector</ENAMEX>. ..."), and its utter regularity across corporate and international
boundaries--how all these things have become matters of mass familiarity.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airline English</ENAMEX> has, in a way, become the
linguistic equivalent of the worldwide nonverbal graphic system that conveys
such meanings as "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>," "no parking," <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"</ENAMEX>first aid," and "information."
It is just as streamlined, just as stylized, often in the same oddly archaic
sort of way. The worldwide symbol for "cocktail lounge" is a martini glass with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">olive</ENAMEX>, even though martinis themselves are a relatively uncommon sight these
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> for "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">pharmacy</ENAMEX>" is a mortar and pestle. Airline language is
similarly atavistic. Whenever else does one hear the word "stow" being used,
except as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX> to "stow your belongings in the overhead
bins"?

            Actually, the other place
where "stow" is frequently used is on board <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>. One significant
element of airline language, including many of its archaisms, derives from the
nautical terminology that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneers</ENAMEX> of air travel appropriated--not
unnaturally, given the obvious parallels between the two modes of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transportation</ENAMEX> (fragile means of conveyance, built to negotiate a boundless,
often turbulent medium of fluid or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>). An airplane is a "<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX>," and its
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX>," including a "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"</ENAMEX>first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>," and "purser," operates from a
"deck" inside a "cabin." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> is segmented by "bulkheads." Its kitchens
are "galleys." It carries cargo in "holds."

            But the
compressed time of air travel gives its language a focused, liturgical quality
that oceanic travel has never had (at least for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>), from the initial
welcome aboard to the cautionary homily to the ritual meal--on more and more
flights, a merely symbolic activity--to the final "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good-bye</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good-bye</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good-bye</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good-bye</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good-bye</ENAMEX>." The linguistic contours of a typical airline
flight are every bit as scripted as those of a religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicene Creed</ENAMEX> of official cabin talk comes in the form of a number
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> regulations, such as No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">121.571</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Briefing</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> before take-off") and No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">121.573</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Briefing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>: extended
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overwater</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>"). The subject matter of these dense passages of text,
which in their original versions date back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1960s</TIMEX>, concerns
everything from seat belts and life jackets to emergency exits and oxygen
masks. The regulations are distilled by each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airline</ENAMEX> into detailed scripts
which are reviewed by company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> and must be approved, finally, by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>. The scripts are then circulated to in-flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>.

            
Credal formulations aside, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX> have
considerable latitude when it comes to routine announcements; again, though,
the language is often fastidiously scripted, down to even the most casual
remarks. ("Would you like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sprite?</ENAMEX>" appears in a script provided by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association of Professional Flight Attendants</ENAMEX>.) Most of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the dozen or so</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX> contacted were reluctant to furnish actual transcripts of approved
language manuals, although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> (with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>) asserted: "You're
gonna hear the same thing, but you'll hear it just a bit differently."
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest Airlines</ENAMEX> did provide an example of an unusual rap announcement that
some of its ground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> have used. It reads, in part: "We board in groups
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX>,/ According to your card;<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/ One</ENAMEX> thru <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> boards <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>,/ It's really
not that hard." And it goes on, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> law prohibits smoking/ On most
domestic flights.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/</ENAMEX> No smoking is permitted,/ So don't even try to light."
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>'s corporate culture of officially sanctioned iconoclasm, if there can
be such a thing, is far from typical.

            From time to time,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> may notice a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew member</ENAMEX> reading an announcement from a laminated
text--changes do get made and are distributed airline-wide--but for the most
part the scripts are committed to memory, and the habits born of rigorous
training die hard. Not long ago, one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> discovered that she was to
be the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX> on a commercial flight, and settled in for the journey.
As she prepared for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> to push back, a flight attendant materialized for
the safety briefing, and in the one concession to the circumstances, sat down
in the seat next to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> instead of standing in the aisle at the front of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX>. The dull monotone was the same as ever. "As we prepare for takeoff,"
the flight attendant said, looking at my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six inches</NUMEX> away, "please
check that your seat belt is fastened"--and here she made the requisite
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clicking</ENAMEX> and unclicking movements with the demonstration model--"and do
take time to look through the safety information in the seat pocket in front of
you. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> is equipped with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> emergency exits. ..."

            As you might imagine, my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>, at that point, was ready to use them all.
