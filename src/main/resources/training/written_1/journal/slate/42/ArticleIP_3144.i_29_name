            Having considered child
abuse and its attendant ills from all sorts of angles--alleged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satanists</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity molesters</ENAMEX>, recovered memories, day-care witch trials--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Kincaid</ENAMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of English at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Southern California</ENAMEX>, has concluded
that at its root the problem is a matter of genre. The thing is, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> abuse as
currently conceived is hopelessly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX>. Stories about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> molesting are
populated by evil monsters and helpless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">innocents</ENAMEX> (rather than flawed or
unfortunate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>), and they languish in a miasma of sinister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">eroticism</ENAMEX>. Child
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">molesting</ENAMEX> is thought to be so evil, so far outside the bounds of civilization,
that no means of exorcism can be considered too harsh or prone to error.

            At the
same time, though, the evil is elusive and invincible. How can we prevent
molesters from molesting? We can't--molesters are monsters, and they'll
continue to molest, no matter what the penalty. (Never mind that the recidivism
rate for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> molesting is less than half the reported burglary rate and lower
than that of many major felonies.) How can we catch them before they start? We
can't--anyone could be a molester. How can we be sure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are telling the
truth about abuse? We can't--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are imaginative and easily influenced by
suggestion. How can we tell whether "recovered memories" are accurate? We
can't. How can we make sure trials convict molesters and acquit the falsely
accused? We can't. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Child</ENAMEX> abuse is horrible; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> abuse is inevitable.
Molesters are monsters; monsters are everywhere.

            The consequence of this conceptual impasse, according to
Kincaid, is endless, repetitive talking. Both sides of the recovered memory
debate--those who "believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>" and those who are skeptical--rehearse
the same script over and over again, claiming all the while to be "breaking the
silence." Their monsters differ (Satanic pornographers and incestuous rapists
on the one hand, megalomaniac <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">therapists</ENAMEX> on the other), as do their helpless
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">innocents</ENAMEX> (wounded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> vs. day-care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreyfuses</ENAMEX>). Both make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demons</ENAMEX> out of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freud</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, but neither steps outside the demonology to question why
we're so obsessed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> abuse in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place. The story line--the
threat, the urgency, the need to expose, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX> language--is the
same.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Strangely,</ENAMEX>
though--and this is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second half of Kincaid</TIMEX>'s thesis--this repetitiveness is
in some nasty little way exactly what we want. It's pleasurable. The more we
exclaim how horrified we are by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> molestation, the more we can permit
ourselves to linger, in a way that's not far from lascivious, over images of
childish bodies. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Little</ENAMEX> tummies! Little bottoms! Little feet!) The more we
condemn the perversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> beauty pageants, the more we get to watch
luscious little <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JonBenet Ramsey</ENAMEX> bat her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby eyelashes</ENAMEX> and to imagine her gory
death. But there's more. Talking about abuse not only permits guiltless
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">voyeurism</ENAMEX>--it also gives shape to inchoate feelings of childhood hurt, it tells
us why we are the way we are and gives us someone to blame, and it deflects a
sense of cultural or moral decline onto a group of particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. In
short, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kincaid</ENAMEX> concludes, not without a certain glee, "Eroticizing exists in
symbiotic relation with sanitizing, and the veiling and the exposing exist in
an encircling doublespeak."

            
This particular brand of sexual doublespeak has
been remarked upon before, most famously by the late <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel</ENAMEX>
Foucault, who, in his History of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sexuality</ENAMEX> (published in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>), put forth his unexpected "repressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hypothesis</ENAMEX>": Those supposedly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tight-lipped Victorians</ENAMEX>, in the course of devising rules to regulate sex and
the sciences that investigate its perversions, in fact talked and wrote more
about sex than anyone before them.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> enmeshed in this culture of sex could no more escape or stand outside
it, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foucault</ENAMEX> held, than they could stand outside their own language. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kincaid</ENAMEX> is
nothing if not an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">optimist</ENAMEX>, though, and he believes that if what's wrong with
the way we talk about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> molesting is genre--we're telling the wrong kinds
of stories--well, then we should just start telling different ones. How? First
of all by acknowledging, rather than suppressing in a panic, the erotic
feelings we have about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>: We should realize that finding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">seductive</ENAMEX> does not compel us to fondle them "in a yucky way," as the day-care
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> so nicely put it. And then we should follow the series of steps
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kincaid</ENAMEX> lays out--steps such as "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Stop looking for monsters and their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>"; "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Stop listening to simpleminded stories"; and "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. Stop tracing
everything backward, looking always to the past for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, explanations, and
excuses." Those who have trouble with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> stage of the process, Kincaid
advises thus: "If you find yourself getting too excited, going too far, wanting
to incite or not to stop--then stop."

            It's possible to dismiss such prescriptions as naive, but
in the context of the quasideterministic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foucauldianism</ENAMEX> from which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kincaid</ENAMEX>'s
brand of cultural criticism emerges, they're refreshing--even startling. When
was the last time a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foucauldian</ENAMEX> offered a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">step-by-step</ENAMEX> cure for cultural
malaise? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kincaid</ENAMEX>'s eccentric combination of suspicious narrative analysis and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">self-help</ENAMEX>, can-do enthusiasm may be just the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Carnegie</ENAMEX> twist these old
ideas need. No, the problem with his analysis is not the prescriptions, nor is
it his occasional failure to restrain himself in the silly jokes department
("<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Innocence</ENAMEX> is a lot like the air in your tires: There's not a lot you can do
with it but lose it"). It's that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kincaid</ENAMEX> can't help himself. He's starry-eyed
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, too.

            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kincaid</ENAMEX>, the
real problem with our obsession with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> sexual abuse is that it distracts us
from other kinds of abuse that affect far more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> than molesting does:
boring, unsensational kinds of abuse such as poverty, neglect, and bad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>.
The question, though, is why these things should be considered child
abuse--why they should be considered more evil when visited upon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> than
upon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kincaid</ENAMEX> believes we should hold on to the sweet, nonerotic
dimensions of the Romantic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child cult</ENAMEX>. We should still adore the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">angelic</ENAMEX> innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blake</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wordsworth</ENAMEX> wrote about. But it's precisely this
sacred little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX> that generates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manichaean</ENAMEX> stories he's complaining
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX>.

            After all, as long as abusing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> is considered somehow much worse than abusing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, child
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abusers</ENAMEX>--sexual or otherwise--will be thought of as monsters. Idealized
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> short-circuit politics, because where they are concerned, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> tend
to say things like "even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> abused (or hurt or hungry or killed) is
unacceptable"; whereas politics needs to be able to weigh risks to some people
against risks to others. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ian Hacking</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosopher</ENAMEX> who has written acutely
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> abuse, has observed that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> seems to be the only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> with
abuse legislation specific to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Our zeal in defending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> is not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">universal</ENAMEX> and not to be taken for granted. Why do we have special charities
devoted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>? Why do we consider the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> bombing especially vile
because it killed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>? Why do we decide custody cases according to the
best interests of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, as opposed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interests</ENAMEX>? This
is the stuff Gothic narratives are made of.
