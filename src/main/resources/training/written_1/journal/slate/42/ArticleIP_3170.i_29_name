            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few weeks ago</TIMEX>, on his
public-radio program A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prairie Home Companion</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garrison Keillor</ENAMEX> spent
several <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> conversing with the occasional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX>, his fictional
twin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, who lives beneath the stage and harbors resentments about a
show-business career that slipped away. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX>, you can't live in the past,"
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keillor</ENAMEX> said at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point. "It does no good to hold a grudge. You've got to
move on, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX>. You've got to find closure."

            
               A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prairie Home Companion</ENAMEX> does not rely for its comedic grammar on concepts
accessible mainly to an overinformed urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX>, so when certain words and
phrases crop up on that program, you can be pretty sure the underlying meanings
have been suffused through the middle-range ZIP codes. Such is the case with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">closure</ENAMEX> , in the sense of bringing an emotional process to its natural
conclusion. The term has so rapidly evolved from restricted jargon into
mainstream patois--it is hardly more "technical" now than the words du
jour after <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX>-stop menu--that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A Prairie Home</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Companion</ENAMEX> cannot only use it safely, but can even give it a knowing, ironic
twist.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Closure</ENAMEX> has familiar applications in the realm of personal
relationships. In the movie <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Heat</ENAMEX> , to cite <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diane</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venora</ENAMEX> says to her ex-husband, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Pacino</ENAMEX>: "I may be stoned on <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prozac</ENAMEX>,
but you've been walking through our life dead. And now I have to demean myself
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph</ENAMEX> just to get closure with you." But the word turns up in any sort of
story where "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">finis</ENAMEX>" is being written. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> who served as unwitting subjects
of 1950s radiation experiments described their recent settlement with the
government as bringing "a sense of closure," using the word in its by-now
standard noun-phrase setting. ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Closure</ENAMEX> on its own sometimes seems
too final.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$450</NUMEX> doll that bears the features of a young
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis</ENAMEX> attributed the doll's popularity to the public's
"unresolved feelings about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX>"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">: Buying a doll</ENAMEX> "gives them a sense of
closure." In contrast, the rambling valedictory press conference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last fall</TIMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre Dame</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lou Holtz</ENAMEX>, was criticized by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sportswriter for
its "absence of any real sense of closure."

            
               Closure is nowadays
most often encountered in contexts involving death. Newspaper and broadcast
accounts routinely describe the return of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">serviceman</ENAMEX>'s long-lost remains from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> as bringing a sense of closure. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Late last year</TIMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> profiled a local undertaker named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberto Garcia</ENAMEX>:
"While the profits are nice, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garcia</ENAMEX> says the most fulfilling part of his job is
helping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> establish a sense of closure." Now that executions are once
again a normal part of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> life--someone is executed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
once a week, on average--they, too, reliably bring on that clausural feeling.
"What I'm hoping is that everyone will have a sense of closure from this," a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police officer</ENAMEX> told a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> after an execution was carried out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 years</TIMEX> after the crimes had been committed. Commenting on a
documentary in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> witnessed the execution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killer</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Sun-Times</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> wrote: "Watching him die
gave them a sense of closure." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicole Brown Simpson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman</ENAMEX> did not witness anything so dramatic, but according to the New York
Times , closure was what they, too, had sought in their recent lawsuit
against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.J. Simpson</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$33.5 million</NUMEX> award was not the issue, they told the
Times : "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rather</ENAMEX> ... they were looking for closure--'justice,' some called
it--to the worst thing that had ever happened to them."

            The
origins of closure are hardly obscure. It is derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> verb
clausere , meaning "to close," which also gives us the enclosed
architectural space cloister , the enclosed syntactical space
clause , and the fear of enclosed space altogether,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">claustrophobia</ENAMEX> .

            
In a political sense, closure , now most
commonly invoked in its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gallic</ENAMEX> variant, cloture , refers to the ending of
debate in a legislative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and dates back to the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>. In literary criticism, closure refers to the manner in which a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poem</ENAMEX> (or any text) achieves thematic and structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">finality</ENAMEX>. In the
psychological jargon of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gestalt</ENAMEX> theory ("<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gestalt</ENAMEX>" being <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> for "pattern" or
"form"), closure refers to the propensity of the human mind to impose or
perceive order despite gaps or asymmetry. This meaning of closure helps
to explain ___ most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have no ________ at all in figuring out the missing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">______</ENAMEX> in this sentence. Fill-in-the-blanks exercises have been fashioned into
what are known as cloze tests , which are designed to test passages for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">readability</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> for comprehension. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gestalt</ENAMEX> term closure has
an application in the world of , where it refers to the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> mentally
imagines what has happened between panels.

            The
impulse behind the real-life quest for a sense of closure--the impulse, that
is, to discern meaning, to impose coherence, to tie up loose ends--is no doubt
as timeless as sentience itself. But how did it come to be so closely bound up
with a specific word? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> factor is the psychologizing of everyday life, a
development that scarcely needs documentation. When we require words to
describe personal motivation and other interior processes, the most likely
source <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is psychology. The lexicon so derived is large and growing:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-dependency , recovery , denial , self-esteem ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">self-help</ENAMEX> . As it has been noted, there are no longer sins, only
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">syndromes</ENAMEX>.

            Asecond factor is the news media, in particular local
television news, which is built on abbreviated human stories with a
recognizable beginning, middle, and end: A violent crime. A daring rescue. A
belated discovery. A sudden disaster. Psychotherapeutic templates are easy to
apply. The words "a sense of closure" have by now been uttered so often on
camera--along with the companion phrase "the healing process," which is what
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> hope will occur after the scab of closure has formed--that they have
joined the off-the-rack vocabulary of stock phrases that ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> can
pick from when a camera appears in front of them.

            How much more deeply a sense
of closure will penetrate is impossible to say--but that it will go deeper is
without question. I won't be surprised to learn someday that wedding vows are
being exchanged in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> is set to last "until a sense of closure do
us part." And surely, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Sense of Closure</ENAMEX>" will be the headline above the news
analysis in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> before the asteroid hits.

            At least we won't have to
read "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Healing Process</ENAMEX>" on the editorial page <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following day</TIMEX>.
