            I've just been reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Homer</ENAMEX>
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> back from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. Arriving with many bags that required anxious
waiting, lugging, and shoving, I found myself wishing that modern clothing
habits were a bit more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homeric</ENAMEX>.

            Since the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Odyssey</ENAMEX> recounts a journey in many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stages</ENAMEX>, with several other trips
contained in it, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Homer</ENAMEX> describes many arrivals and departures, often at
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">princely</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Homeric</ENAMEX> times as now, a luxurious welcome involved a bath,
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and drink, entertainment, and a comfortable bed for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX>. Unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX>,
however, it involved new clothes, too. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">At the time Homer</ENAMEX> wrote about, clothing
was a household supply, like a wine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cellar</ENAMEX> full of casks or many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herds</ENAMEX> of
cattle and coops of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chickens</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Guests</ENAMEX> would use the clothes the way they used
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>, and service.

            Reading about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telemachus</ENAMEX>' trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sparta</ENAMEX> to visit Queen
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menelaus</ENAMEX>, for example, you realize that he brought no luggage at
all, except gifts for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>. When he arrived, he was stripped, washed,
oiled, and freshly dressed from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> to foot in garments woven by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX>. His own were presumably cleaned and absorbed into
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household</ENAMEX>--no word from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Homer</ENAMEX> on this. The same thing happened every
evening throughout his stay, and he left for the next stage of his trip, also
carrying only gifts, dressed in whatever his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> had last given him to wear.
He could expect to be reclothed by whomever he visited next.

            Homeric
clothes were often elegant. Elaborate patterns, some of them with narrative
scenes, might be woven into fabrics of great finesse, their finely spun fibers
dyed in strong and subtle colors. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> did all this work, and they did it
unceasingly for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>, which could become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">famous</ENAMEX> because of it, if
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mistress</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was a talented fabric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> and had skilled help.
For clothes, they wove the cloth in person-sized widths and lengths--no cutting
off the bolt--and garments were created by draping, pinning, or wrapping them
onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. Sometimes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pieces were sewn up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> and across the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shoulders</ENAMEX>, with slits left for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>, to be slid on and belted or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sashed</ENAMEX>--very basic, a few sizes would drape to fit all.

            
The most famous clothing drama in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odyssey</ENAMEX> begins with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odysseus</ENAMEX> washed up on a beach, naked and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-dead,
on the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeaea</ENAMEX>. The goddess <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX>, his watchful patroness, soon
arranges to get him saved and sent onward. She prompts the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Princess</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nausicaa</ENAMEX> to cajole her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> into letting her drive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>'s worth of dirty
clothes all the way down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>'s edge in a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ox</ENAMEX>-drawn <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon</ENAMEX>, to spend
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> with her maids washing and drying them on the beach, right where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX>
knew she would find the shipwrecked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odysseus</ENAMEX>.

            Reading
about this, you realize that laundry could be so large and rare a project only
because the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> was supplied with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of available
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">garments</ENAMEX>, along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of</NUMEX> sheets and blankets, and kept on
making more. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">princess</ENAMEX> wanted the laundry done right now, though, because
she hoped to find a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> soon, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> would need clean clothes and
bedding for possible marriage feasts. A handsome, stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX> would be
certain to capture her interest, too. Those gods left nothing to chance.

            All goes as planned, and the princess gives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odysseus</ENAMEX> a suit
of the family clothes, now clean and dry. Then she tells him how to find the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palace</ENAMEX> and how to approach her royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to ask their help, not liking to
present him as somebody she had picked up on the beach. But when Odysseus
appears alone as a needy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX> before them, the queen narrows her eyes:
And just where did you get those clothes you have on? The queen
recognizes garments she had designed and woven herself. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nausicaa</ENAMEX> had forgotten
to allow for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>'s long-term proprietary knowledge of her own work.

            That
sounds familiar enough, since we're used to the distinctiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX>'
ideas and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX>'s pieces. What seems alien is a particular garment being
always linked with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX> but not with a particular wearer. In a world
without textile or clothing markets, each piece of weaving was like a family
meal or a home performance of music, available to anyone present but the
property of no one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, never bought or sold, always identified with the one
who had created it inside that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. Except in times of war or pillage, it
changed hands only as a gift.

            
Since most garments were plain rectangular
pieces, being well dressed meant having an attractive personal style--draping
your cloak in a novel fashion, sashing your waist with particular flair. When
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Homer</ENAMEX> wants to dwell on the perfections of dressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>, he mentions the
dash with which their clothes are worn, unless the point is the beauty of the
fabric and who had woven it. Often the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guardian</ENAMEX> deity adding more
dash after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is fully dressed--refining the coiffure, improving the
facial expression, and sprinkling extra grace over the frame.

            Ordinary
clothes in the modern world are even now approaching a certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homeric</ENAMEX> sameness
in their basic shapes, with individual appeal added by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wearer</ENAMEX>'s own style.
You can see the ideal in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gap</ENAMEX> ads: A T-shirt and denim pants just sit there,
until a supple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> slides into them and strikes a cool pose. The more
fantastic grow <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> gowns on the runway, the more uniform grows the garb
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX>. Mass-market pants and shirts and jackets are
everywhere much the same, and suggest interchangeability; outstanding effects
arise from interesting fabric or a terrific-looking wearer.

            What contemporary travel needs to become truly convenient
are updated versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Homeric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>. You get to a hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> in your
travel-stained sweater, shirt, and pants, and drop all these down a chute. You
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shower</ENAMEX>, slip on the robe provided (this part we already have), and then, in the
cupboard, you find stacks of pants and shirts and sweaters, maybe a wrap-skirt
or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and some jackets, all in many colors and all in your size, since you
e-mailed the information ahead with your reservation. You dress afresh in your
choice of these, have dinner, spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX>, dress anew in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> if you
like, and check out. On to the next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, same story. Eventually you get <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>,
carrying no bags, wearing some clothes you can add to your own collection as
souvenirs of your most recent stay--ready, of course, to offer them to your
next houseguests in exchange for theirs.

            If somewhere on your travels
you find you suddenly need a really good suit for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, that would be
arranged, like a rental car, or added as an extra hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>. The hotel
would deliver the desired ensemble to you (along with the indispensable
needle-and-thread <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and the right shoes) and would return it after you had
checked out. At posh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> with posh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX>, supplies would be high-level
and instantaneous. Nonposh ones would put you in touch with the nearest agency
for a more modest range of products. You'd have to invoke your own gods for the
requisite charm.

            Underwear didn't exist in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Homeric</NUMEX> times, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> didn't travel, except for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddesses</ENAMEX> who flew through
the air. For my scheme to work, certain questions, I admit, need more thought.
But the thought of traveling without packing, except maybe for a tiny computer
and a tiny camera, has a powerful charm of its own. Some might even take a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sketchpad</ENAMEX> instead, or a paperback volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Homer</ENAMEX>.
