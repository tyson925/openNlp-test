            "I mean, really, it seem
like everybody and they momma done had something to say on the subject!" The
sentence comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Geneva Smitherman</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Language</ENAMEX> and Literacy Program at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan State</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of the books <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Talkin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Testifyin</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>) and
Black Talk (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>), and one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> quoted most frequently by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX> seeking context for the national controversy over
"ebonics"--a form of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Black English</ENAMEX> recently granted official recognition as a
separate language by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX>, school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>.

            As it
happens, though, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smitherman</ENAMEX>'s words have nothing to do with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX> school
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>'s action. They were written <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades ago</TIMEX>, when the vernacular used by
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s inner <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and the rural <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> was receiving its
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round of national attention, partly as a result of influential works of
scholarship such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.L. Dillard</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Black English</ENAMEX> ( <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years</TIMEX>
later, in a widely publicized ruling, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> ordered local school
districts to take account of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Black English</ENAMEX>. The most remarkable element of this
story, in other words, is how unchanging it is. The central pedagogical
problems (low achievement by large numbers of black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, and how to reach
these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>), the scholarly arguments (how should Black English be
characterized?), the flashes of racial feeling, the sober (and dyspeptic)
public commentary--one could transplant it all from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one era</TIMEX> to another, without
risk of anachronism.

            To recap the events of the present <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>, then--briefly: On
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 18, 1996</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oakland Unified School District</ENAMEX> unanimously endorsed a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX> whose ulterior intentions remain unclear, but which, at the very
least, declares that the "primary language" spoken by many of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28,000</NUMEX> black
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> is not <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>. It is a distinct language--not a dialect, not
nonstandard speech--called "ebonics" (a combination of "ebony," meaning
"black," and "phonics"). The resolution asserts that deficiencies in black
educational achievement cannot be remedied unless the prevalence of ebonics is
recognized and somehow dealt with. What might "somehow dealt with" involve?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representatives</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> have given answers that sometimes
conflict with the wording of the resolution itself on such issues as whether
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ebonics</ENAMEX> would or should be a language used in formal instruction (as opposed to
something that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> simply should be given financial incentives to be aware
of and conversant in); whether ebonics would itself be taught as a subject; and
whether claiming the status of a distinct language for ebonics was, in fact, a
ploy to shake loose federal bilingual-education <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars</NUMEX> (an outcome immediately
ruled out by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard W. Riley</ENAMEX>, the secretary of education).

            Needless
to say, the confrontational language of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX> resolution, and the
ill-advised statement that ebonics is "genetically based," did nothing to
stifle criticism. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> to read the full text of the resolution.) The
educational politics of this issue will no doubt play themselves out in the
usual messy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> way--and, with luck, they will do so beyond the glare of
publicity (that being where experimental educational programs that involve the
inner-city vernacular but avoid the manifestos are already taking place).

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> points deserve mention.

            First,
the word "ebonics," which dates back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1970s</TIMEX> and has been used even
in some public-school settings without controversy for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, may seem to be
putting on airs, but what many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguists</ENAMEX> prefer to call "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Black English</ENAMEX>
Vernacular" or "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American Vernacular English</ENAMEX>" is a major linguistic
stream that has been flowing within recognizable channels for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benjamin Franklin</ENAMEX> and, before him, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cotton Mather</ENAMEX> left simulations in their
writings of the speech of some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> that anticipate vernacular
renderings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.) There is, of course, no single "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Black English"</ENAMEX>--there are
various black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Englishes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, for instance--and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Vernacular</ENAMEX> is not considered a separate language by most language
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> or, for that matter, ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. (As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentator</ENAMEX> has
recently noted, the complaint about rap lyrics is not that they can't be
understood.) But the black <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> speech at issue in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX>--however one
categorizes it as a language or a dialect--not only is pervasive but also
displays features that one finds nationwide, owing to its roots in the black
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> from a common region, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>. There are telltale characteristics,
widely if not universally present: the replacement of an initial "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>" with a
"d" sound ("dis," "dem") and of a medial or final "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>" by an "f" or other
consonant sound ("with" becomes "wif," "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>" becomes "bruvah"); a reduction
of consonant clusters in general (so that "first" becomes "firs" and "hand"
becomes "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">han</ENAMEX>"); the replacement of a final "r" sound with a vowel sound
("summah" for "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>" and "mo" for "more"); the prevalence of so-called
plosive consonants (making a word such as "bill" sound more like "beel"); the
placement of stress on a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, rather than a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, syllable ("<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DEE</ENAMEX>-troit");
the disappearance of the final "s" from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">third</NUMEX>-person singular verbs ("what go
'round, come 'round"); the dropping of the copula ("I here," "the coffee cold")
and of certain tense <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inflections</ENAMEX> altogether. The ancestry of vernacular
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> such as these is diverse and includes antique forms of English and
slave-trade-era maritime lingua franca, but an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> origin for many of them
has been persuasively argued for. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">West African</ENAMEX> languages, to give just one
example, also tend not to make use of a "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>" sound.

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, disagree as one might with the highhanded approach
taken by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oakland Unified School District</ENAMEX>, the linguistic challenge
confronting urban <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> defies armchair comprehension. Discussions around the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">holiday</ENAMEX> dinner table in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenwich</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grosse Pointe</ENAMEX> may characterize ebonics as
an issue mainly of laziness or sloppiness--something whose rectification should
be a matter merely of better habits or self-control, like standing up straight
or looking another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in the eye. The front-line literature from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classrooms belies</ENAMEX> that notion. Those interested in acquiring some (sanitized)
sense of how great is the task--even in the absence of any other social
problems--that faces a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> wishing to impart mainstream speaking and
writing skills to black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who don't have them might consult the
soon-to-be-published <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>: An <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">African-American Handbook</ENAMEX>--A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide</ENAMEX> to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mastery of Speaking More and Better English</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savannah Miller Young</ENAMEX>, a
black elementary-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>. (The book will be available in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mid-January</ENAMEX>. Address queries to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P.O. Box 11704, Clayton, MO 631005-3098</ENAMEX>.) After
several brief introductory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX>, the book settles into a detailed program
of lessons and drills. The therapeutic lesson plan I suggest for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of
standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>: Imagine what would be involved in undertaking this
program yourself, in reverse.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Labov</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of
linguistics at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of an early study,
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Stratification</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>), has been
arguing for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> that, whatever its original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, the language of poor,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> is becoming ever more divergent from that of other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de</ENAMEX> facto racial segregation and social isolation become the permanent lot of a
vast subgroup of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African Americans</ENAMEX>. The widespread use of the so-called
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invariant</ENAMEX> "be" to indicate continuous or habitual action ("he be late"),
for instance, is not a historical legacy but a development of the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.

            "Ebonics" may not merit the
status of a distinct language now, his research seems to imply--but just give
it time.
