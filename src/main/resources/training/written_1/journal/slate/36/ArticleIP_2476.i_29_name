            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> is aggressively
seeking to shape the future of personal computing, Internet publishing, and
electronic commerce. It has achieved a dominant position in the computer
industry already and is poised to extend its reach. Is what is good for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> good for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>? Not always. Consider the following:

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> has never been
known for its innovations. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> for more on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s history of
borrowing.) Yet, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> operating-system software is used to run <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 80</NUMEX>
percent and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> of the world's personal computers now, and that share is
increasing.

            When personal computers
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> entered the market, there was enormous innovation in new desktop-software
applications. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> has come to dominate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> important
desktop market after another, there have been fewer and fewer new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrants</ENAMEX> or
new products in these markets--and, many would say, far less innovation.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the most important
challenge in selecting a word processor, relational database, or other desktop
application is finding a product that can perform adequately without crashing
when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> is running the latest version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s Windows operating
system. More and more often the safest bet is--not surprisingly--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>, the
only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that really knows how its operating system works and the only
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that can arbitrarily change how that operating system works. (For
examples of how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> uses its control of the operating system to undermine
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX>, click .)

            The Internet is the most
successful new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> for publishing and sharing information. It developed in
an environment that was profoundly anti-monopolistic, and which embraced open
standards. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> ignored the Internet initially, even creating a rival
proprietary network architecture for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Network</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Microsystems</ENAMEX> has
developed a computer programming language named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Java</ENAMEX>, designed so that programs
written in it would run on any computer, regardless of the operating system.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Java</ENAMEX> language is very important for the development of feature-rich Web
publishing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> wants to create a special <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Java</ENAMEX> language for Windows. Its
version won't run on non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> operating systems, damaging the promise that
the same software will run on different computers. This will permit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>
to exercise the same type of proprietary control over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MS Java</ENAMEX> applications that
it does over other Windows applications.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> known for
its aggressive anti-piracy campaigns, is spending <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens</NUMEX> (perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX>) of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of dollars to develop and promote the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer</ENAMEX>,
which it gives away. Why? By monopolizing the browser market, and by destroying
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Java</ENAMEX>'s promise as a cross-platform language, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> will be in a position to
transform the Internet radically by moving toward a new set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>-owned
or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>-controlled standards for Internet publishing and electronic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commerce</ENAMEX>. (For more on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s efforts to monopolize the Internet, click
.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> is trying to
position itself to own the software used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> to operate a new
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of cable-TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX>, consumer electronics, and other devices that
will be used to connect to the information superhighway. This would extend the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monopoly Microsoft</ENAMEX> has on operating systems for personal computers.

            Not
content with its enormous market share in PC software, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> wants to hold
our hand as we navigate the information superhighway, and to push us--not so
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subtly</ENAMEX>--toward its own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subsidiaries</ENAMEX> by strategically placing
desktop or browser links to its products and services. This will give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>
enormous advantages in positioning its own products in electronic commerce and
let it play <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kingmaker</ENAMEX> for other businesses. (For other examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s
predatory ways, click .)

            
For those who look into the future and are
concerned, there are some fundamental questions: What can be done? What should
be done? What will be done? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wherever Microsoft</ENAMEX> goes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>, it must
not be allowed too much control over something as important as the way we
communicate with one another.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX> wrote in The
Road Ahead about the need for a dialogue on the information <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX>. Next
month a group of industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>, consumer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> will gather in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>, at a conference to debate
the impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s business practices and to develop strategies to
address the future of digital communications. How about joining us, Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>?

Technology, prepared additional material for this article.
