            During the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> era, a
series of jokes circulated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Armenian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX> reflecting upon the
accuracy of the local radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>. "Is it true, as reported, that Belemjian
won <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 million</NUMEX> drams from a municipal lottery<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>" a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> asks his local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX>.
"Absolutely true," the radio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcer</ENAMEX> replies. "Except it wasn't a lottery but
a <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">poker</ENAMEX> game. And it wasn't <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 million</NUMEX> drams but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> drams. And he didn't win
it, he lost it." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franklin Foer</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Louis Gates</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jr.</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academic</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Entrepreneur</ENAMEX>" is nice about my own work, but it gets
so many things wrong that it makes me feel for poor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belemjian</ENAMEX>. A few
highlights:

            My
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitae</ENAMEX> lists the advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> and editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> I've
participated in since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>. I didn't serve on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal boards</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">82</TIMEX> advisory
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committees</ENAMEX> over the course of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX>, as 
                  Slate
                suggests, but
over the course of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some 22 years</TIMEX>. (For that matter, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Periodical</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Literature Project</ENAMEX> concluded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women Writers</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1910-1940</TIMEX> series concluded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>.)

            I'm said to be the only academic with his own "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of
staff." This turns out to refer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W.E.B. Du</ENAMEX> Bois
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX>. (I'm its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>.) Does 
                  Slate
                think I'm the only
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX> with an administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX>?

            Then I'm
said to have one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> to edit my writing and another whose job it is to
conduct journalistic research. Who are these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>? And why haven't they ever
reported to work? In fact, I have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX>, who is working on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> documentary. Sadly, the life of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reilly</ENAMEX> 
                  Slate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evokes</ENAMEX> is no
life of mine.

            
Ihad a hard time recognizing the encyclopedia
project from 
                  Slate
               's account. For example, it says that I'd
discovered that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> of the early entries written by staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> had
ripped off other reference works. Needless to say, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such entry would be
unacceptable, and we've adopted strict safeguards to prevent any such problems.
But even in that early batch, the proportion of tainted entries wasn't a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>;
it was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 percent</NUMEX>. (All were immediately corrected or jettisoned.) In any
case, offering an assessment of an encyclopedia without having read it is like
assessing an issue of 
                  Slate
                that hasn't been posted.

            An
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encyclopedia</ENAMEX>--like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> and unlike a novel--is a collaborative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">venture</ENAMEX>,
and it depends upon the skills and competencies of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of learning.
Global Culture represented the combined efforts of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, and they
are all acknowledged by name in the book. (By contrast, 
                  Slate
               's
assessment relies entirely upon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> who are not identified by name.) I can
be justly reproached for any careless errors that made it into print, but not
for the collaborative nature of the enterprise. 
                  Slate
                is
similarly displeased that I invited fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> to write individual
introductions for each volume of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schomburg Library of Nineteenth-Century</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African-American Women Writers</ENAMEX> --a series that I conceived and for which I
served as general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>. Their names appear on the title pages.

                  Slate
               's general implication is that I capitalize on the
uncredited labors of others. I'm confused. Who are these uncredited
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX>?

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> 's most damning exhibit is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norton Anthology</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American Literature</ENAMEX> , a project to which I've devoted a great
deal of time and energy over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> section <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> helped put the
anthology together. But, 
                  Slate
                protests, "it was [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>'] byline
that appeared on the cover." Yes, my name appears on the cover. So does that of
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nelly MacKay</ENAMEX>. And so do those of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 ten</NUMEX> section
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>. Is there a problem here?

            To take
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>' objections one at a time:

            His vitae lists many
advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>. Some include termination dates; most do not.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> may not have intended to give the impression that he still
serves on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> category, but that is hardly an unreasonable
conclusion to have reached. Obviously, when his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vitae</ENAMEX> says he no longer
serves on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>, I didn't include it in my tally.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Glenshaw</ENAMEX> may have as
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> title "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W.E.B. Du Bois Institute</ENAMEX>." But
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Glenshaw</ENAMEX> refers to himself as "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Louis Gates Jr.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of staff</ENAMEX>." I know
of no other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academic</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> assumes this title.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> denies the existence
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistants</ENAMEX>. I hope it will refresh his memory if I remind him of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vazquez</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Bois Institute</ENAMEX> work-study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>. Granted they do not work
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full time</TIMEX> on the projects I described in my article, but I don't think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>
will deny they perform these tasks.

            For the article, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> asked
not to be quoted about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Encyclopedia</ENAMEX> because of a nondisclosure
agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>. In our conversation, he said he didn't have a precise
figure on the percentage of plagiarized entries. (I wish he had provided this
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 percent</NUMEX> figure to me.) But he conceded that the number of entries
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plagiarized</ENAMEX> had been "substantial." <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> others I spoke with who were
intimately involved in producing the first batch of entries confirmed the
percentage I cited.

            Gates
says that he credits others' labor on many projects. Clearly, he is right. But
because of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX> and organizational acumen, he is the one who always
seems to get top billing--or one of the top billings--touting his involvement
in these collaborative efforts. This is merely an observation, not an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accusation</ENAMEX>.

            Finally,
I would like to make clear that, in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hourlong</TIMEX> conversations, I gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>
the opportunity to confirm or deny nearly every matter of fact in this article.
Back

            
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Triangulates</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skip Gates</ENAMEX>
has admirably resisted getting sucked into the fuss over the headline <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>
Magazine put on its current profile of him (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Head Negro in Charge"</ENAMEX>). Yet he
is overwrought about our piece in 
                  Slate
               . If you gather from his
letter that the 
                  Slate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX> was a hatchet job, check it out. Not
only was it admiring in many ways, but many of the specific points to which he
responds don't even amount to criticism. Nevertheless, we want to get things
right and be as fair as possible. So here (after a phone conversation) are some
further comments and clarifications:

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> on which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> says
no one could possibly suppose he was trying to imply he is currently on those
boards: We accept that he was not trying to imply this, but you wouldn't be
insane to infer it--especially given that some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> do list a leaving
date.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of staff</ENAMEX>": Not only did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glenshaw</ENAMEX> identify himself to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franklin Foer</ENAMEX> as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of staff</ENAMEX>, but others confirmed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glenshaw</ENAMEX> often refers to himself that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> objects that the article describes him as "an academic" with a chief
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, but it is not "as an academic" that he is assisted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glenshaw</ENAMEX>. We
are happy to note that distinction, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> may weigh for themselves.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assistants</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> says no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> edits his work. Someone who works with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> claims to regularly "tweak" his writings. Whether "tweaking" equals
"editing" is, once again, up to you. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> denies using any work-study students
for research help. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foer</ENAMEX> says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with reason to know said otherwise.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foer</ENAMEX> concedes he didn't confirm this with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> himself but notes it seemed
utterly uncontroversial. And indeed, the piece did not suggest there was
anything unusual or wrong with using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>, tweakers, or graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>.
Which there isn't.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>'
denial that he ever uses others to dig up quotes for his articles: Someone says
that he has served <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> in this way. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of 
                  Slate
                has
often asked others to track down a quote, sees nothing wrong with it (as long
as you ask politely), and doesn't believe the article suggested there was
anything wrong with it.

            5The Encyclopedia : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foer</ENAMEX> did not say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> had said a
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of the early entries were plagiarized. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">others</ENAMEX> had said so.
Naturally these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">others</ENAMEX> insisted on not being identified, but there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of
them--all in a position to know. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> denies it. Someone is fibbing. Do three
anonymous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> with unknown biases outweigh one obviously interested but
named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">party</ENAMEX>? This is the classic news <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX>'s dilemma, and we leave you to
it.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norton Anthology</ENAMEX> : The article implies that only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>' name appears on the
cover. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> asserts all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>' names are on the cover. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>' name and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other appear on the front cover. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> appear on the spine. The author
checked the cover on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, which only reproduces the front cover. That's
not an excuse--just an explanation. Anyway, we apologize wholeheartedly for
implying that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>' co-general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> is not on the front cover and
halfheartedly for implying that all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> aren't on the spine.

            
7The general issue of crediting the work of
others: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> objects most strongly to the assertion that "there is something
dishonest about marketing under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>' signature work that is produced mainly
by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistants</ENAMEX>." Whether that is a fair conclusion to draw from the evidence
is something the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>, once again, can decide. We merely note that a) the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> does present evidence, not just the naked assertion quoted here; b) the
piece also has many positive things to say, not just about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skip Gates</ENAMEX> and his
scholarship in general but specifically about his mass-production technique; c)
in context, the complaint is about general academic practice, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prime</ENAMEX> example, as much as it is a specific criticism of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> himself.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>' complaint
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foer</ENAMEX> did not give him a chance to answer various points made in the piece:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foer</ENAMEX> notes that he discussed these general issues with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX>. If
there are specific points in the piece he failed to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> the opportunity
to challenge, he should have, and he and 
                  Slate
                apologize. We are
happy to have given him that opportunity now.Back
