            In the debate over whether
to legalize gay marriage, both sides are missing the point. Why should the
government be in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decreeing</ENAMEX> who can and cannot be married?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Proponents</ENAMEX> of gay marriage see it as a civil-rights issue. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Opponents</ENAMEX> see it as
another example of minority "rights" being imposed on the majority culture. But
why should anyone have--or need to have--state sanction for a private
relationship? As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> around the world contemplate the privatization of
everything from electricity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>, why not privatize that most
personal and intimate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>, marriage?

            
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Privatizing</ENAMEX>" marriage can mean <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two slightly</NUMEX> different things. One is to take
the state completely out of it. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> want to cement their relationship
with a ceremony or ritual, they are free to do so. Religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> are
free to sanction such relationships under any rules they choose. A second
meaning of "privatizing" marriage is to treat it like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any other contract</TIMEX>: The
state may be called upon to enforce it, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> define the terms. When
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> or large sums of money are involved, an enforceable contract spelling
out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>' respective rights and obligations is probably advisable. But
the existence and details of such an agreement should be up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>.

            And privatizing marriage would, incidentally, solve the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gay</ENAMEX>-marriage problem. It would put gay relationships on the same footing as
straight ones, without implying official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> sanction. No one's private
life would have official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> sanction--which is how it should be.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sullivan</ENAMEX>, one of the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> of gay marriage, writes, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marriage</ENAMEX> is a
formal, public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> that only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> can grant." But the history
of marriage and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> is more complicated than modern debaters imagine, as
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Stone</ENAMEX>, writes: "In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early Middle Ages</TIMEX> all that
marriage implied in the eyes of the laity seems to have been a private contract
between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. ... For those without property, it was a private contract
between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, enforced by the community sense of what was right." By
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 th century</TIMEX> the formally witnessed contract, called the
"spousals," was usually followed by the proclamation of the banns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, but the spousals itself was a legally binding contract.

            
Only with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Earl</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Hardwicke's Marriage Act</ENAMEX>
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1754</TIMEX> did marriage in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> come to be regulated by law. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonies</ENAMEX>, marriages were performed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justices</ENAMEX> of the peace or other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magistrates</ENAMEX> from the beginning. But even then common-law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> were valid.

            In the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 th century</TIMEX>, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has intruded upon the marriage
contract, among many others. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> has tended to promulgate a standard,
one-size-fits-all formula. Then, in the past <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislatures</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> have started unilaterally changing the terms of the marriage contract.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1969 and 1985</TIMEX> all the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> provided for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">no-fault</TIMEX> divorce. The new
arrangements applied not just to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> embarking on matrimony but also to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> who had married under an earlier set of rules. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> felt a sense
of liberation; the changes allowed them to get out of unpleasant marriages
without the often contrived allegations of fault previously required for
divorce. But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were hurt by the new rules, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who had
understood marriage as a partnership in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> would earn money and
the other would forsake a career in order to specialize in homemaking.

            Privatization of religion--better known as the separation
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>--was our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founders</ENAMEX>' prescription for avoiding <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s
religious wars. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> may think each other headed for hell, but we keep our
religious views at the level of private proselytizing and don't fight to impose
one religion by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of law. Other social conflicts can likewise be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">depoliticized</ENAMEX> and somewhat defused if we keep them out of the realm of
government. If all arts funding were private (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as 99 percent</NUMEX> of it already is),
for instance, we wouldn't have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> debating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mapplethorpe</ENAMEX>'s photographs or the film <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Watermelon Woman</ENAMEX> .

            So why not
privatize marriage? Make it a private contract between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. If they
wanted to contract for a traditional breadwinner/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homemaker</ENAMEX> setup, with
specified rules for property and alimony in the event of divorce, they could do
so. Less traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> could keep their assets separate and agree to
share specified expenses. Those with assets to protect could sign prenuptial
agreements that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> would respect. Marriage contracts could be as
individually tailored as other contracts are in our diverse capitalist world.
For those who wanted a standard one-size-fits-all contract, that would still be
easy to obtain. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> could sell books of marriage forms next to the
standard rental forms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Couples</ENAMEX> would then be spared the surprise discovery that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsiders</ENAMEX> had changed their contract without warning. Individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>,
synagogues, and temples could make their own rules about which marriages they
would bless.

            
And what of gay marriage? Privatization of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX> would allow gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to marry the way other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">individually</ENAMEX>, privately, contractually, with whatever ceremony they might
choose in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, or God. Gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are already
holding such ceremonies, of course, but their contracts are not always
recognized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> and do not qualify them for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1049</TIMEX> federal laws that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> says recognize marital status. Under a privatized
system of marriage, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> and government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> would recognize any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX>'s
contract--or, better yet, eliminate whatever government-created distinction
turned on whether a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> was married or not.

            Marriage is an important
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX>. The modern mistake is to think that important things must be
planned, sponsored, reviewed, or licensed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> in
the debate over gay marriage share an assumption that is essentially
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collectivist</ENAMEX>. Instead of accepting either view, let's get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> out of
marriage and allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to make their own marriage contracts, as befits
a secular, individualist republic at the dawn of the information age.
