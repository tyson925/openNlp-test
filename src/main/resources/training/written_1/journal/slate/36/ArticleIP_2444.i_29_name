               Forget
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Alamo</ENAMEX>!
            

            This sounds crass, but I
can't deny it: I desperately wanted the standoff at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Republic of Texas</ENAMEX>
trailer-trash compound to last longer than it did--for selfish reasons.

            Not weeks
longer, mind you. Just <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX>. Just long enough for me to get
there . Having missed all the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> vs. fringe standoffs--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruby</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ridge, Waco</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana Freemen</ENAMEX>--I was determined to go and bear witness this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. I would find out at last if mysterious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX>-dispatched "black
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">helicopters</ENAMEX>" really buzz around at these things like giant hell-spawned
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bumblebees</ENAMEX>. I would document the local movements of guts-and-glory militia
reinforcements. (A militia offensive of some sort was widely rumored on the
Net, where one rabid militia <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> wrote: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">WE HAVE HAD A BELLY FULL OF THE FBI</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BATF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ETC. ETC. ... Lock and Load</ENAMEX>, prepare to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rock and Roll</ENAMEX>.") It sounds
silly now, but militia trouble did seem plausible at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fort Davis</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday, April 30, three days</TIMEX> after the siege began, several heavily armed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic of Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were apprehended at a truck stop near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pecos</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 90 miles</NUMEX> from the action.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, none of it was to be. I took off from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.J.</ENAMEX>,
at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6:30 p.m.</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 3</TIMEX>. After landing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Paso</ENAMEX>, I called a militia
contact who had agreed to ask around about possible right-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bivouacs</ENAMEX>. (I
even brought camping gear!) Things looked "hot" when I left--from inside his
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard McLaren</ENAMEX> was busily faxing out apocalyptic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maydays</ENAMEX>--but his hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> turned to pink <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jell-O</ENAMEX>.

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hey</ENAMEX>!" said my contact.
"Guess you heard. It's over."

            "What? No! McLaren was
talking so tough."

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Well</ENAMEX>, he came out."

            While I
groaned, he described <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the final hours</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaren</ENAMEX> had swallowed the old
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">negotiator</ENAMEX>'s bait of surrender "with honor." The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lawmen</ENAMEX> treated him like the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a brave conquered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. He would be allowed to press in court his
claim that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Republic of Texas</ENAMEX> had been illegally annexed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1845</TIMEX>. Then he would go to jail for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>. Not the best of deals,
but he obviously preferred it to Plan B: getting shot.

            
Irented a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and putted around morosely,
listening to the radio and mulling over my options. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmen</ENAMEX> were boasting,
justifiably, about the happy outcome. Yes, there was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> tiny glitch--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROT</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> had somehow slipped away--but that was no problem. A drawling
official said these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fugitives</ENAMEX> were not experienced in the back country, so they
would be easy pickings. For my part, I knew there would be little left to see.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">militia</ENAMEX> would "stand down." Even the trailer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX>--which had been
tricked out with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swiss Family Robinson</ENAMEX>-style self-defense gizmos--was still
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">off-limits</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>.

            There was, however, one
notable event left: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">factions</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Republic of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> were holding a big rally in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kilgore</ENAMEX>, to make clear that the movement
would live on. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX>, as you probably know, contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> competing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clans</ENAMEX>.) I unfolded my map. Hmmm. Kilgore was way over by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX>. Even at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles per hour</NUMEX>, I could count on driving <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least 12 hours</TIMEX>, making it just in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> for the opening gavel at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 p.m.</TIMEX>

            Was it worth it?

            No, but what else could I
do--go see the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad Caverns</ENAMEX>? I buckled up and hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>.

            
               My
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Countries</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Right</TIMEX> or Wrong
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The trip</ENAMEX> was worth it, at
least in terms of understanding what motivates <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Republic of Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">believers</ENAMEX>.
What motivates them is: They're nuts. All of them.

            That word is somewhat loaded,
so I should be more precise. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are nuts like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilliputians</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulliver</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Travels</ENAMEX> were nuts. They don't drool or wear their shirts
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">backward</ENAMEX>, but they do expend insane amounts of energy on ridiculous "politics,"
dissipating most of it through meaningless infighting and petty posturing. Are
they evil, hateful nuts? No. I kind of liked most of them. They would be fun
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to go fishing with.

            
Unfortunately, they have this other hobby: seceding from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>. And, being
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texans</ENAMEX>, they have enough <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ammo</ENAMEX> to potentially make matters not so cute.
Most non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLarian ROT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> publicly disavow violence, but the possibility
always lurks. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Groups</ENAMEX> like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Republic of Texas</ENAMEX> exist in a murky gray zone
where relatively harmless right-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bigmouths</ENAMEX> meet the frightening shriekers
of renegade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">militias</ENAMEX>, raising the question: At what point does nutty end and
scary begin?

            
You can never tell, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Keyes III</ENAMEX> is a
good example of how quickly A can become <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Z. Keyes</ENAMEX> is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McLaren</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">follower</ENAMEX> who actually carried out the kidnapping and shooting that started the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">whole Fort Davis</ENAMEX> mess. He's originally from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX>--so, to find out more about
him, I called a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detective</ENAMEX> there who tracks the far right. He'd
heard of him only once, in a nutty-but-funny context. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keyes</ENAMEX> filed papers
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> demanding that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> return portions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to the
rightful ownership of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Republic of Texas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tee-hee.</ENAMEX> Next thing you know,
however, he emerged as a serious shoot-'em-up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>.

            As for
the meeting, it was simply funny-nutty, but it became all too clear that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">republic</ENAMEX>'s separatist fantasies will live on. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few hundred</TIMEX> boisterous
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texans</ENAMEX>--mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, middle-aged or above, with a fair number of angry young
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rednecks</ENAMEX> and dotty old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>--filled the cramped banquet <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> of a run-down
motor lodge in "downtown" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kilgore</ENAMEX>. Crowding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of a long dais were
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frowning</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> non-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">McLarian Republics of Texas</ENAMEX>. One is
headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Johnson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odessa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>. He didn't show up, but some of his
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> did--they were gray, natty, and grumpy, like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Baptist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deacons</ENAMEX>.
The other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">faction</ENAMEX> is under the sway of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Archie Lowe</ENAMEX>, a long-haired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who looks
like an amiable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rider</ENAMEX> and whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> are a tiny bit more young and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">with-it</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archies</ENAMEX>' current agenda includes a quest for "international
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX>" and the convening of a "<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Constitutional Convention</ENAMEX>" this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>.

            The meeting itself was extremely hard to follow. After
generic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">introblab</ENAMEX>, the floor was opened to "the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>," a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">platoon</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brave</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World Epsilons</ENAMEX> who lined up behind a floor microphone and took turns
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">huffing</ENAMEX> and ranting. Among the highlights:

            A very pale young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> stood
up and said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judgment Day</ENAMEX> was coming unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Republic of Texas</ENAMEX>
succeeded. Then he started crying.

            A stocky <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> in a red shirt
and a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Republic of Texas</ENAMEX> cap stood and dramatically announced that he was the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">driver</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> detained by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pecos</ENAMEX>. It was all
a gross injustice, of course. Yes, he and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> were traveling
with full packs, semiautomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pistols</ENAMEX>, radios, and plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ammo</ENAMEX>,
but he said they were merely going to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kermit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, to "hunt wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hogs</ENAMEX>." But
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pecos</ENAMEX> is not on the way if you're going to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kermit</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garland</ENAMEX>. I asked him
later: Why was he there? "I was curious about what was going on," he said. "On
a personal level."

            A
gap-toothed old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> yelped that the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is "getting boxcars
prepared with some kind of leg irons in 'em to fasten you into place to ship
you to concentration <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>."

            
OK, perhaps quoting the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> is a cheap
shot. Then again, I heard similar effusions from a high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Warmke</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wiry</ENAMEX>, sun-burnished old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mustard</ENAMEX>-colored Western suit who serves as
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of commerce and trade" for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Branch McLarian</ENAMEX> remnant. I liked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX>,
and I just hope his nuttiness stays "funny," but I have to wonder. When we met
he extended a huge sandpapery hand and said: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Howdy</ENAMEX>! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Warmke</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">W-A-R-M-K-E</ENAMEX>.
Hot lock, warm key." We talked about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaren</ENAMEX>--"The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX>; he has a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX> IQ"--and I raised the question of violence. Given that the federal
government and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> are always and forever going to kick ass in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> vs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX> confrontations, when would a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patriot</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX> feel justified in
picking up a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> and charging?

            And with such overwhelming
odds, why would he do that?

            "You'll not know how
close some came," he said eerily. "I can tell you that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">militias</ENAMEX> have
but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> methodology in mind. They do not intend to assemble <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-,
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> armed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in one spot and allow napalm to destroy them! There is a
tactic called 'targets of availability.' What that means is ... Your
interpretation would be terrorism. There is no one that can control that. There
is no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> could control that."

            Bomb talk! Did he hear about
specific targeted sites?

            "I have suspicions, but I'll
not answer that based on suspicions."

            After <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX> left, two
Archie-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faction ROT men</ENAMEX> scurried over and nervously assured me that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX> was a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kook</ENAMEX>. Great. Why didn't I feel reassured?

            
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joke</ENAMEX>
Stops Here
            

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, I finally visited
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fort Davis</ENAMEX> on the way back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Paso</ENAMEX>, just to get a feel for the place. Things
sounded quite sparky on the radio. Early <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that morning</TIMEX>, reports said that
someone fired at the bloodhounds, and that lawmen were closing in. I arrived
about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 p.m.</TIMEX> and roosted for a while by the police roadblock at the entrance to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Davis Mountain Resort</ENAMEX> subdivision. In the distance rose the stark, rocky,
mesquite-covered peaks that define this area. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">couple of dozen</NUMEX> sunburned,
siege-weary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> were hanging around in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> explained that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resort</ENAMEX> itself was miles and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> away. Whatever was happening, we wouldn't be
able to see it or hear it.

            I took off and stopped for
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> in the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Valentine</TIMEX>. Inside I met an old codger named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clifford</ENAMEX>
Beare, who had recently retired from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Davis County sheriff</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>. I asked him if it would be hard for runaways to hide in treeless
mountains.

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Well</ENAMEX>, I guess, but you could
hide. There's a lot of caves and stuff."

            Did he think these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> would
get caught?

            "I think
they will," he said. "Yes I do."

            
He was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> right. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">About</TIMEX> that time one
fugitive, believed to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Matson</ENAMEX>, was getting shot to death in a gun
battle. The other, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Keyes</ENAMEX>, appears to have got away, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, the
authorities scaled back the search for him, making vague noises about the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">terrain</ENAMEX> and wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> finishing him off. "He can ... only have a finite
amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Cox</ENAMEX>, who has been the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s spokesman
throughout the siege.

            What? Of all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keyes</ENAMEX> is the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX> who demands to be taken seriously. He started
the violence; he never gave up; and he went out ready to blast away and die.
They better hope something gets him, because if he does stagger out of those
mountains alive, he's going to be biblically, nuttily, and unfunnily
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pissed</ENAMEX>.
