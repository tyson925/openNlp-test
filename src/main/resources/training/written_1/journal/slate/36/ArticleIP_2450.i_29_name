            What would it be like to be
white?

            It's a question I've never
really considered, but pondering it now, I find the answer unsettling: It
wouldn't be all that different. Yes, of course it would mean unstitching from
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX> that thread of thoughts and habits one might call "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>"--and who
knows just how unraveled I'd become without that thread? But as far as how the
world would treat me--ignoring me or not, abusing me or not, redeeming me or
not--I can't say I would be much better off for being white.

            For although I am
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chinese-American</ENAMEX> and thus a "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> of color," I am also this: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">suburbs</ENAMEX>, product of mostly white <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junior officer</ENAMEX> of the overclass,
skeptic of hard-core multiculturalism, friendly with many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> but
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> with few, never once the victim of blatant discrimination, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> now
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haymon</ENAMEX>. I am, by the reasoning of racial ascription, already
quite white.

            What that
says about me I'll leave for those who know me to assess. What it says about
our idea of whiteness, though, is for all of us to contemplate. In the
cosmology of race, whiteness is something like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">black hole</ENAMEX>--a crushingly dense
complex of myth and rumor that pulls us, invisibly and irresistibly, into its
hold. We move according to its properties, yet we know not why we move.

            Consider, for instance, the now-standard formulation that
if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> would only surrender their race-consciousness, we could all ascend
to a colorblind nirvana . You hear this line from plenty of well-meaning
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>. But you also find it embedded in nasty right-wing polemics against
diversity and affirmative action. The idea is simple: Given "the end of
racism," or at least the end of "irrational" discrimination, minority
bellyaching only upsets what would otherwise be the proper social
equilibrium.

            I'm the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to concede the awful, balkanizing folly of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">left-liberals</ENAMEX> on race.
And to be sure, we've stockpiled so much "difference" over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> that a
round of identity disarmament would be welcome. But we should first acknowledge
that it is white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>-consciousness--never quite named as such in our
popular discourse--that begets the compensatory identities of nonwhite
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>. And it is whiteness that must first be revealed and
surrendered before we can ever hope to transcend race.

            
White <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>-consciousness manifests itself in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> forms: as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blessing</ENAMEX> and as burden. In both cases, it exists mainly by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">negation</ENAMEX>; it nourishes itself upon all that it excludes. Thus it is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>
don't generally think of themselves as having a race at all. To be white,
really, is not to be many things--most notably, black--and to derive
both security and standing from the absence of the stigma.

            It is
precisely this sense of "anti-race"--this affectation of colorless
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neutrality</ENAMEX>--that has allowed whiteness to insinuate itself as the social norm.
This is whiteness-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as</NUMEX>-blessing: the knowledge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> have that in law, in
literature, in politics, and in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> other realms, "a regular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>" is,
by default, a white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. Our vocabulary for assimilation makes the point.
How do we describe the method by which nonwhites enter the mainstream and climb
the class ladder? We say, or at least think, that they're "becoming white."

            It used to be, of course, that "becoming white" was an
option open only to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>. But over the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>,
high-achieving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian-Americans</ENAMEX> have been anointed "honorary" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>, usually so
ordained by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> wary of black militancy. By striving and succeeding
without complaint, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> have become, in the words of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irving</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristol</ENAMEX>, "just another 'European' ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>."

            Ah, I see:
Some are born white, others achieve whiteness, still others have whiteness
thrust upon them. This is sheer narcissism, the notion that "making it" means
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">whitening</ENAMEX>. And when it comes from the white right, it's narcissism in the
service of hypocrisy. For some of the very guardians of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s alabaster
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">template</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Buchanan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Brimelow</ENAMEX>, and their ilk--are the same ideologues
who reflexively rebuke <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> for any show of ethnocentrism.

            
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> variety of white
race-consciousness--whiteness-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as</NUMEX>-burden--is no less tangled up in hypocrisy.
But while whiteness-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as</NUMEX>-blessing expresses the arrogance of privilege,
whiteness-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as</NUMEX>-burden reveals the willful ignorance of privilege. Nowhere is that
more clear than in the periodic appearance of what I call the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Left-Behind</ENAMEX>
White.

            In the
'70s, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Left</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Behind White</ENAMEX> appeared in the form of the "unmeltable ethnic,"
that long-assimilated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>- or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX>- or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> who, in the wake of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Power</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX>, felt it necessary to dust off and revive the ways of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Country</ENAMEX>. He re-materialized in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late '80s</TIMEX>, this time in the guise of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Angry White Male</ENAMEX>, the forgotten victim of minority preferences and "reverse
discrimination." <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A decade later</TIMEX>, he has entered the scene again, dressed now in
the finery of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euro</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>, a pitiable white who can't find his heritage
but doesn't want to get left behind in the parade of affirming identities.

            The spectacle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Left</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Behind White</ENAMEX> tells us again that
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> who complain about black obsessions with blackness are themselves
obsessed with whiteness. What they are obsessed with in this case, though, is
the cultural emptiness of whiteness. In a cruel reversal, it is the white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>,
with no tradition to call his own, no history but one laden with guilt and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">apology</ENAMEX>, who is "truly disadvantaged."

            Just
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deserts</ENAMEX>, you might say, for those minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">multiculturalists</ENAMEX> who pretended that
equality of cultural recognition was as good as equality of actual power: Now
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> want to play the same game, recounting to us the sufferings of the
Celts, the indignities borne by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welsh</ENAMEX>, yet still retaining the power
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">premium</ENAMEX> they've long enjoyed--as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>.

            
But alas, we've hit a sure conversation-stopper
now: the question of white power. No one, really, wants to talk about that.
Perhaps it's because "white power" sounds too much like an accusation. Perhaps
it's because "white power" brings to mind those neo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> supremacists, those
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hateful</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX> who, most white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> will say, "aren't like us"--and who,
truly, aren't like most white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>. But whatever the reason, we have an
almost allergic reaction to any serious consideration of the ideology of
privilege we call "whiteness."

            How else
to explain the reaction to "whiteness studies," an academic discipline that has
emerged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX>? Sure, whiteness studies, which might include
everything from the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> to the folkways of suburban
mallrats, is open to abuse, and therefore to ridicule. It appears, at a glance,
like ethnic studies gone fatuously awry--and some of it is indeed loopy.

            But whiteness studies has also been mightily, and
deliberately, misunderstood. It is not the self-adulation of an already
dominant class, or a crusade by the oppressed to demonize <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Man</ENAMEX>. It is simply
an attempt to identify the ways that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> remain blind to, and blinded by, an
unspoken faith in <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">race</ENAMEX>--and to expose the means by which white skin and "white
attitudes" still confer social advantage.

            It seems to me that we could
all use some of that schooling. For it is whiteness--not blackness--that is the
original sin of identity politics. And it falls on all our shoulders--not just
colored ones--to rid the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> of its viral color-consciousness. What would
it be like to be white? <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One day</TIMEX>, perhaps, there will be a better way to measure
the blessings and burdens of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> life.
