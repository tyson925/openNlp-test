            We all
know--supposedly--that if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John F. Kennedy</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, he wouldn't be.
His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> would have collapsed under the relentless reporting of his
dalliances with actresses such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilyn Monroe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angie Dickinson</ENAMEX>, unsavory
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mob moll</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judith Campbell Exner</ENAMEX>, suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX> spy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen Rometsch</ENAMEX>, and twentysomething <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fiddle</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faddle</ENAMEX>. Back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> dined out on rumors of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>'s adultery as they made sure those stories were kept out of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>. "We knew. We all knew," said former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBJ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reedy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Reeves</ENAMEX>' book on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>, A Question of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Character</ENAMEX> . (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Answer to the Question: rotten</ENAMEX>.)

            But it
has become a journalistic truism that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> has been disbanded, that today
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> would pursue rumors of flagrant infidelity by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joseph</ENAMEX>
Lelyveld, executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York Times</ENAMEX> , recently told The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Observer</ENAMEX> , "[<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">I</ENAMEX>]t was always clear that given [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s] alleged
history, reckless philandering in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> would be a story."

            
For proof one only has to look at the scandal
that has engulfed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, right? Yet something nags about the story
of the (yes, yes,) alleged affair between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and his very own <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fiddle</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX>. If such behavior is a legitimate story, why has it taken <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> to find out that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s rapacious sexual appetite has apparently never
been slaked but simply changed venue? During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> the press has surely had
as much suspicion about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s misbehavior (click for some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>) as it
did of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>'s but has chosen, until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent weeks</TIMEX>, mostly to ignore or
dismiss it.

            One
simple reason is that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>, proof of presidential
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misbehavior</ENAMEX> is hard to come by. We may all "know" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JFK</ENAMEX> had an affair with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monroe</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seymour Hersh</ENAMEX>, while writing <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Dark Side of Camelot</ENAMEX> , was
so desperate for evidence that for a time he was duped by forged documents
supposedly proving the liaison. In his history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> era, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reeves</ENAMEX> writes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>, concerned that increasingly clamorous rumors of an
affair with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monroe</ENAMEX> might actually make it into print, sent former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace Corps</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Haddad</ENAMEX> to tell various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> himself said the stories weren't true. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Years later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reeves</ENAMEX> writes,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haddad</ENAMEX> said: "He lied to me. He used my credibility with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> I knew."
(Attention <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Begala</ENAMEX>.)

            
But when seemingly hard facts about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
past have thrust themselves upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> have needed a different
justification for turning them aside other than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> doctrine that it was
none of the public's business. That justification was the widely held
convention that during his candidacy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> addressed the issues of his past
infidelities, however obliquely, and that by electing him twice the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> had
given him a pass. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Commentator Mark Shields</ENAMEX> has said of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> scandal
that it represents a violation of a "tacit agreement between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electorate</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>." That is, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> would ignore his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>
shenanigans as long as they didn't continue in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. Let's call it
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ozark Exemption</ENAMEX>.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lelyveld</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> decided not to pursue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> allegations
of numerous simultaneous affairs--made by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troopers</ENAMEX> who
guarded then-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>--because "We made a deliberate choice ... not to be
aggressive on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philandering</ENAMEX> ... partly because the country
had voted on it." It's debatable, however, how fully the public was informed of
the extent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s alleged womanizing. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> recently
reported, among other tactics, the campaign paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100,000</NUMEX> to private
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">investigator Jack Palladino</ENAMEX> to find and discredit alleged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> paramours.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Sabato</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">political scientist</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Virginia</ENAMEX>, told The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palladino</ENAMEX> led a "very aggressive campaign to suppress
information." <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> I spoke to who covered the race said he came to
believe--but of course never made public--that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>.

            
The handling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Troopergate</ENAMEX> charges is
illustrative of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>'s discomfort with the whole subject. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>-bashing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectator</ENAMEX> published similar versions of the story almost simultaneously.
There was a small flurry of attention among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, but according to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Journalism Review</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> declined even to air the charges. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> wrote only reluctantly about it, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
Post treated it mostly as a media story. Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times , publication of the story was controversial. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Nelson</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> bureau <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> at the time, said, "there was conspiracy, in my
opinion, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">right-wingers</ENAMEX>" to force the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> to run the story before it
was ready. (Representing the troopers was <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> and avowed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton-hater Cliff Jackson</ENAMEX>, who had tried to arrange for a right-wing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX> to create a fund for the troopers before publication, in case they
lost their jobs.)

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Journalism Review</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Hanson</ENAMEX> even called for a
return to the standards of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>'s day. He wrote: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">In the 1960s</ENAMEX>, after all,
just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few dozen</NUMEX> national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> could define what is news, and they were
able to decide that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JFK</ENAMEX>'s sexual adventures (an open secret) did not qualify.
Today, unfortunately, the rationalists have lost the power to set standards of
relevancy."

            
There was a central charge in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Spectator</ENAMEX> accounts that should have been
a warning that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s predilections weren't just history but also current
events. This was that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, after his election to the presidency , had
the troopers <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">escort</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> to meet
him at dawn while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> slept <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">upstairs</ENAMEX>. (It also signaled a penchant for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">convenience</ENAMEX>, and risk, of cheating at home--a trait for which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> was
known.) And a now eerily familiar phrase--one that seems unlikely to be spoken
spontaneously--recurs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> story. When the paper
contacted the unnamed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> said to have met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX>, she
responded that "there was no improper relationship." Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> confronted
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> denied even knowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. Subsequently she told them
she and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had not had "an improper relationship."

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Spectator</ENAMEX> piece led directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paula Jones</ENAMEX>. Identified only as
"Paula" in the story, she was described by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> trooper as offering to become
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> after their encounter. She filed suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, charging that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had exposed himself to her. But while she got
plenty of media attention, her story was widely dismissed as irrelevant under
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozark Exemption</ENAMEX>, or as the nattering of, in the words of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> 's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evan Thomas</ENAMEX>, "some sleazy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> with big hair coming out of the trailer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parks</ENAMEX>"--a remark for which he later apologized. It wasn't until <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart Taylor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jr.</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Lawyer</ENAMEX> investigation that the rest of the media
began to take the charges, though perhaps not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>, seriously. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>'s
class bias protected <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gennifer Flowers</ENAMEX>--surely
he couldn't be attracted to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who wasn't a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale Law School</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX>!

            
The other significant story of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
continuing sexual adventuring was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Isikoff</ENAMEX>'s account <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last August</TIMEX> of a
"murky" encounter between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> volunteer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathleen Willey</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. The allegation, reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> , is that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willey</ENAMEX> met
alone with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> to ask for a paying job, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
made a pass at her--a charge denied by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX>. What <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isikoff</ENAMEX>
couldn't pin down was whether the advance was welcome or not. Among media
heavyweights the story was about as welcome as a piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kryptonite</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> didn't even cover the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Willey</ENAMEX> story until the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>
allegations broke in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> dismissed it as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> imbroglio--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drudge Report</ENAMEX> had leaked details before
publication.

            Perhaps
the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who took the account seriously was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> himself.
Recent reports allege that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> broke off his sexual relationship with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> around that time because he was afraid of the attention the Willey
story might provoke. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>, too, took action when liaisons became too
dangerous. For more on that, click .)

            
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> story exploded because it takes
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s behavior beyond the sexual into the criminal--with its looming
questions of perjury and obstruction of justice. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Historian Thomas Reeves</ENAMEX>
believes that, despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>'s reluctance to look into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>'s private
life, if he had lived to have a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">term</TIMEX>: "[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>]he realities of his lechery
and his dealings with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Giancana</ENAMEX> might have leaked out while he was still in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, gravely damaging the presidency. ... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Impeachment</ENAMEX> might well have
followed such public disclosure." In other words, the careless only stay lucky
for so long.
