            In full-page ads in major
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office Depot</ENAMEX> assure the public that their proposed
merger into a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 billion</NUMEX> office-products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> will lead to lower prices for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> supplies. Their "larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> and greater buying ability," they
say, will produce lower costs, and that will "mean bigger savings for you." How
thoughtful.

            But maybe
you suspect that when the two top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> in a market stop competing and
merge, the result will be higher prices, not lower. This kind of thinking goes
by the name of "antitrust"--a concept that's been out of fashion in recent
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Trade Commission</ENAMEX> shares your suspicion and voted, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4-1</ENAMEX>, to
hold up the deal. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTC</ENAMEX> has even been inviting public comments over
the Internet--reportedly a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> for any federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> is
chattering with amateur antitrust <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sleuths</ENAMEX>. (To read the discussion, or to join
in yourself, check out some of the newsgroups addressing the topic.)

            For some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, office supplies are a subject that
inspires much passion. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office Depot</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reuters</ENAMEX> that he's using
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bodyguards</ENAMEX> because of threats, apparently from his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. A few of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, at least, seem to buy their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>' argument that the merger
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">will</ENAMEX> (probably) lead to price cuts because it will (definitely) lead to job
cuts. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">believers</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who have bid up the stock prices of
both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>.

            Is it
possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office Depot</ENAMEX> have a case? That their merger would be
good--or, at least, would not be bad--for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>? Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, both the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTC</ENAMEX> have taken a far more tolerant view of
mergers and acquisitions, partly on the grounds that increasing international
competition provides a check on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conglomerates</ENAMEX>. Few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, of course,
buy their office supplies in foreign countries. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has also become
more sensitive to the details of particular products and markets. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bigness</ENAMEX>" per
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">se</ENAMEX> is no longer sufficient grounds for suspicion. Account must be taken, as
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> have long argued, of the greater operating efficiencies and,
hence, presumed lower costs produced by concentration. Moreover, if a company
hoards its savings from size, instead of passing them on to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> in lower
prices, new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> will enter the business.

            
But the merger of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> is
inherently more suspicious than a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that comes to dominate the market
through its own growth. And appreciation of the competitive market's marvelous
capacity for self-regulation can be carried to extremes. Markets bear
watching--and common sense is often a better guide to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> than the
advice of battling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> will run regression analyses and
estimate the cross-elasticities of demand. And they will compute
Herfindahl-Hirschman indexes that show the measure of concentration in a given
market. And in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> will have to consult their own
judgment.

            Consider
the question of what constitutes the market in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office Depot</ENAMEX>
compete. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> want to define the market as broadly as possible. They
would include not only such small-scale office-supply <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> as may survive
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> they have invaded, but mammoth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circuit</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">City</ENAMEX>, which sell some office supplies. By this measure, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>
figure, the combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staples</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">553</NUMEX> superstores in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> markets across the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office Depot</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">571</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> (mostly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superstores</ENAMEX>) would still command <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10 percent</NUMEX> of the market.

            But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTC</ENAMEX> takes a different view. Sure, you can buy many
of the products that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office Depot</ENAMEX> sell in other places. But their
strength as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> lies in their being one-stop office-supply superstores
where all these products are brought together in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (often bewildering)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agglomeration</ENAMEX>. And in this market, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staples</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office Depot</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> rival, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX> Max. A merger of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> would
allow them to control <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> or more of the relevant market, dominate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>, and drive out upstart <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTC</ENAMEX>
has some telling facts to back up its theory. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has sales data showing
that prices are lower in markets where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> superstores
compete--and lower still where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> are in local competition. In other
words, forget market-share equations: Look at prices to find the real story.
Another common-sense check: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> big reason that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staples</ENAMEX> was anxious to merge
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office Depot</ENAMEX> was that it feared an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office Depot</ENAMEX> invasion of its home turf,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX>. What did it fear, exactly, if not that competition would force it
to lower its prices?

            
The essential question is whether the predicted
cost efficiencies of a merger will outweigh the lost discipline provided by
competition. (It is ironic to see, for example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fulminating</ENAMEX> against government interference with this merger, since the notion
that the efficiencies of bigness outweigh the discipline of competition used to
go by the name socialism, or even the name communism.)

            Is the
cost-cutting story plausible? As a dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office Behemoth</ENAMEX> could
command concessions from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paper Clip Inc.</ENAMEX> But surely these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> superstore chains
are already big enough to squeeze <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> quite effectively. What's to gain?
More likely, any cost savings would come from eliminating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in shared
markets--that is, from eliminating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> that currently compete with each
other.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTC</ENAMEX> seems inclined to steer a middle course: Permit the
merger, on condition that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office Behemoth</ENAMEX> sell off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> superstores to the
remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX> Max. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> would be sold at bargain prices,
and many are located in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">communities</ENAMEX> where there would otherwise be no
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">post-merger</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> seems to be giving some credence to the
claimed benefits of the merger, while hedging its bets on the competition issue
by shoring up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office Max</ENAMEX> and seeding healthy retail conflict in scores of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>.

            This
moderate course doesn't satisfy the most avid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumerists</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Nader</ENAMEX>, for
example, notes that if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office Max</ENAMEX> now supports the merger, which it does, that
makes you wonder how much real competition is in the offing. If the fast-food
world had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonalds</ENAMEX>'s proposed to buy out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burger King</ENAMEX>,
how reassured would we be if they offered the palliative of selling a few
franchises to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taco Bell</ENAMEX>? Do you take comfort that, in some sense, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Lobster</ENAMEX>
will provide competition? Not much.

            
Much of the Internet discussion about this
merger frames the issue as: Which is worse, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Business</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Regulator</ENAMEX>? In
my view, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTC</ENAMEX> seems to be getting the balance about right: neither rolling
over and playing dead nor being blind to business practicalities and long-run
competitive innovation in retailing (new kinds of superstores, discount
shopping on the Net. Who knows?).

            Interestingly, too, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTC</ENAMEX>
seems to have picked an issue to take a stand on that really matters to people
outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">beltway</ENAMEX>. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, at work, on a messy problem
with real consequences to our everyday lives. That could be trust <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, if
not trust busting.
