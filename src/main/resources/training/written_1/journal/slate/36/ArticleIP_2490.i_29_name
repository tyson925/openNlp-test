<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Paul</ENAMEX>-area <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. The gift is believed to be the largest ever
given to a college or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> boosted an earlier
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10-million</NUMEX> pledge, "because it feels strongly that there never has been a
greater need for management education based on values and ethics." The gift
will allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> to endow <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 10</NUMEX> new professorships and to create a
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2-million</NUMEX> scholarship fund that will assist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> attending
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spirituality of Management</ENAMEX> seminar at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>.

for the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children's Center</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John's Hospital</ENAMEX>. The gift was
from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> who wished to remain anonymous, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernadine Gutowski</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spiritual</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis</ENAMEX> in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> required us to sign an agreement on the part of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor</ENAMEX>'s identity anonymous," she said. "But it's fair
to say the money came from someone who identified with our values and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX>."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25 million</NUMEX> to

Sgro, who works in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>'s development <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. Whoever the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> may be,
they have ushered in a new era at the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. Gerald Quigg</ENAMEX>, a
fund-raising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> attached <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only three</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stipulations</ENAMEX> to the gift. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> must stick to its goal of providing

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milwaukee</ENAMEX>) from an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumnus</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> for a new

who died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1997</TIMEX>. The amount was proffered as a challenge gift, and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> has required the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> to seek additional donations to match the
original figure. The gift is among the largest ever received by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marquette</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 million</NUMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CENTENARY COLLEGE</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shreveport</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La.</ENAMEX>), for unrestricted use. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trustees</ENAMEX> have voted to designate the gift as a dollar-for-dollar matching fund
to invite additional donations to the capital campaign. "Thus we intend to
transform this <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 million</NUMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $20 million</NUMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centenary College</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth L. Schwab</ENAMEX> said.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 million</NUMEX> in
cash to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MARY BALDWIN COLLEGE</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staunton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va.</ENAMEX>) This is the largest cash gift
received by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Baldwin</ENAMEX> and among the largest given to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s college. This
gift is unusual not only in its size but also in its purpose, which is to fund
several one-time projects. Founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1842</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Baldwin</ENAMEX> is the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s
college affiliated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Presbyterian Church of the United States</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science</ENAMEX>. The pledge is the largest single gift in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX>'s history. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">donors</ENAMEX>, one of whom has long-standing ties to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars Hill</ENAMEX>, based their decision
to make the pledge primarily on the quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> now at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX>.
"We are deeply humbled by the generosity of these wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>," said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max Lennon</ENAMEX>.
