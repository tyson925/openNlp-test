            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Week/The</ENAMEX>
Clones

            
               (Something slightly
overlooked in the frenzy of speculation about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dolly</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep cloned</ENAMEX> by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>, are the details of the experiment that resulted
in her creation. We asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Berry</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">geneticist</ENAMEX>, to explain how <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dolly</ENAMEX> came
into being, and why, from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX>'s point of view, she matters.)
            

            First, we have to look at
what we mean by "cloning." We've been cloning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some 25 years</TIMEX> now. In
other words, we can propagate small strips of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> outside their parent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. (We put a piece of, say, sheep <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> into a bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, which
reproduces itself asexually--doubling its genetic material and splitting--and
each time, it replicates our sheep gene.) We've been cloning cells for longer.
Certain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> can be "cultured," reproducing themselves like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in a
petri <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX>. Both forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cloning</ENAMEX> constitute major technological
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accomplishments</ENAMEX>, but neither comes close to reconstituting an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. That is
a much bigger problem.

            Not an
insurmountable <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. As every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardener</ENAMEX> knows, you can regenerate entire plants
from the smallest cutting. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> are not so straightforward. The only
kind of whole-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism cloning</ENAMEX> we've been able to perform up till now has
involved DNA taken from early embryonic tissue. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> were
able to generate entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">frogs</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> that came from embryos <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 80</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> old. Any older, and no new frog developed. That is because cells in very
early tissue are what is known as undifferentiated--not yet committed to a
particular developmental path. What's revolutionary about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dolly</ENAMEX> is that the DNA
that created her was taken from a grown-up, differentiated cell.

            until now, the conventional wisdom in biology has had it
that while early embryonic cells are "totipotent," capable of becoming any kind
of tissue, once cells have differentiated into a particular tissue type they
must remain that type. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pre-Dolly</ENAMEX>, differentiation in animal tissue was regarded
as an irreversible process. If we cloned muscle cells, we got more muscle
cells. Muscle cells were not going to generate liver cells.

            How does
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> work? We don't really know. We do know that every cell contains
an identical and complete set of genetic instructions, the genome. As cells
mature, however, they switch on some parts of those instructions, and switch
off others. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in your muscle tissue switch on muscle genes. The cells
in your liver switch on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver genes</ENAMEX>. But we can't explain this process--why
some cells express some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, and not others. The process of development (or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX>) is one of the least understood in biology. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one end of the</TIMEX>
black box you put in a simple cell, the fertilized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>, and out of the other
you get a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>, an earthworm, a human--a mature animal of staggering
structural complexity.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dolly</ENAMEX> is living proof that the process can go
backward. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dolly</ENAMEX> is derived from a single mammary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. Conventional wisdom
would have dictated that mammary cells, which are highly differentiated and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specialized</ENAMEX>, could produce only more mammary cells. But the mammary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> that
gave rise to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dolly</ENAMEX> became dedifferentiated , capable of generating the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> range of different cell types that make up a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>.

            Given the
high-tech world of modern biology, the method by which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> team
managed to provoke this extraordinary dedifferentiation is almost old-fashioned
in its simplicity. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dolly</ENAMEX>'s case, they took a mammary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and grew it on a
petri <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX> in cell culture so that it produced more copies of itself. They then
essentially starved the cells so that they shut down normal metabolic function,
entering a "quiescent" <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, in which dedifferentiation apparently occurs. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from one of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> was then transferred into an unfertilized <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> egg
cell from which they had carefully removed the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. (Unfertilized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> contain
only the mother's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>; by adding the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from an adult mammary
cell--which has both its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>--the egg cell then had the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> found in adult sheep cells.) The egg cell was biochemically
pre-programmed to commence development, and that, apparently, was enough to
jerk the mammary-cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> out of its quiescent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> was put into a
surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 weeks later</TIMEX>, we got <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dolly</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> question that inevitably comes up is whether there is
something peculiar about the way sheep mammary tissues differentiate. A second
result in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish</ENAMEX> study that has been largely ignored by the media--but
which is, in biological terms, equally important--suggests that the answer is
no. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biologist Ian Wilmut</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> also cloned lambs out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> derived from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sheep</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus fibroblasts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> found in connective tissue. Even in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblast</ENAMEX> is as highly specialized and fully differentiated as a mammary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dolly</ENAMEX> is more of a media magnet than her unnamed fibroblast-derived cousins
because she came from adult tissue. Biologically, though, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> experiments
are comparable: In both cases differentiated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> became sufficiently
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dedifferentiated</ENAMEX> to generate a whole new <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>. The result is, therefore, not
mammary-specific, but more general.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dolly</ENAMEX> and her
fibroblast-derived <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousins</ENAMEX> have changed forever the way we think about animal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. Cells in mature animal tissues are not, as we had thought,
irreversibly differentiated. Understanding differentiation is the key to
understanding development, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dolly</ENAMEX> embodies the extraordinary possibility of
manipulating the process--of doing experiments to identify the basic
construction rules used in putting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> together.
