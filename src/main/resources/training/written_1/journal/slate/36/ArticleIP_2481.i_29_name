            During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a typical lunch time</TIMEX>
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royalton Hotel</ENAMEX> restaurant in midtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, The 
               New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorker</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Brown</ENAMEX> might be installed at her usual table, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogue</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Wintour</ENAMEX> might be at her usual table (chewing on her usual
meal--a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25</NUMEX> hamburger). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graydon Carter</ENAMEX> might be there too,
although he has transferred his main allegiance to a place called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Patroon</ENAMEX>.
Filling out the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> are other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>, publicists, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> from these
magazines and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GQ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">House & Garden</ENAMEX> and so on. And <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>,
who probably isn't there himself, picks up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">every</NUMEX> tab. Some of the lesser fry
may even utter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX> mantra--though it is hardly necessary at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royalton</ENAMEX>--as they grab for the check: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Let Si</ENAMEX> get this."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.I.</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX>"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newhouse Jr.</ENAMEX> and his younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald</ENAMEX>, control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advance Publications</ENAMEX>, one
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s largest privately held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estimate</ENAMEX> of their combined
wealth: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$13 billion</NUMEX>.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald</ENAMEX> tends to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advance</ENAMEX>'s hugely profitable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>,
radio, and TV holdings. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX> runs the less profitable but more glamorous
properties. These are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>, including (in descending
order of fabulousness) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogue</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GQ</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√</ENAMEX>©
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nast Traveler</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">House & Garden</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allure</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Details</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Self , Mademoiselle</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Glamour</ENAMEX> ; ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>.

            The expense-account lunch is a hallowed journalistic
tradition. But consider a day in the life of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> working for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si Newhouse</ENAMEX>.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> are a different story, as they will be happy to tell you.)
It's a closed economy where almost all human needs and desires can be gratified
with a miraculous, unlimited currency called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX>.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Town Car</ENAMEX> is waiting
outside your door in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> to take you to work. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, which costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX>, is written into your contract. First stop, breakfast with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Four Seasons</ENAMEX>. The check may be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as little as $40</NUMEX>. When you reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>,
you realize you're out of cigarettes. No problem--you send your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> to
buy a pack for you. She gets reimbursed from petty cash (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3</NUMEX>). (Could be worse
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX>: She could be forced to pick up her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>'s birth-control
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX>, or her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>'s pet from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX>, or presents for her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>--regular duties for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX> underlings.)

            You've
forgotten to return the video your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> watched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, so you have a
messenger take it back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blockbuster</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Si</ENAMEX> spends <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20</NUMEX>; you save a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.50</NUMEX> late
fee.

            
Then there's lunch. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> account for
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a quarter</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daytime</TIMEX> revenues at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Four Seasons</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royalton</ENAMEX>. A
modest lunch for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royalton</ENAMEX> (no fancy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> or anything) might cost
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$80</NUMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX>'s generosity extends to even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistants</ENAMEX> and sub-sub-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>, dining
on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sushi</ENAMEX> at their desks. If you spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10</NUMEX> or less on lunch, and claim you were
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">working</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX> pays. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vogue</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> , almost everyone has a
"working lunch" <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> . An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allure</ENAMEX> says that "working
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lunches</ENAMEX>" there are limited to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>.

            Back at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, you hear
that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> at another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newhouse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> has been promoted, so you send
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. The tab: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX> pays. (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of my favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX> stories is of
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> who had just been promoted to an extremely senior job. His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> was
jammed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">congratulatory flowers</ENAMEX> and cards. All had been sent by fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cond√</ENAMEX>©
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX>. All had been billed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">o'clock</TIMEX>, and it's
snack time. Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> joins the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mob</ENAMEX> in the lobby newsstand. She bills your
candy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX>, and cigarettes (as well as her own candy bar, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX>, and
cigarettes) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15</NUMEX>). After all, it's a "working snack." Later,
there's a birthday <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> for your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX>. You order <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">champagne</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX>--on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, of course, and present her with your gift--a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prada</ENAMEX> wallet
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200</NUMEX>). Later, she submits the expense sheet for it. Finally, after a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> book <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Le Cirque</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> (estimated cost to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$35,000</NUMEX>), your car
ferries you home.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newhouse</ENAMEX>
expense stories are a staple of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> literary-journalistic conversation.
Stories about the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10,000</NUMEX> in expenses that a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Yorker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> billed
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a single month</TIMEX>. About the interior-decorating costs for the
fashion-magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> who likes to have her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> photographs rearranged
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every few months</TIMEX>. About the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> tab for the big-name <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> who
spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hay</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX> (basic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$285</NUMEX> a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>)
researching a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> story that will never run. About the
Vogue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> who has furnished her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> from items purchased for
fashion shoots--beautiful furniture, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> pillows, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>-table books.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vogue assistants</ENAMEX> have nicknamed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Petty Cash Junction</ENAMEX>."

            None of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39 past</TIMEX> and present <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newhouse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> I spoke
to for this story would talk on the record, for . And the nature of the subject
makes it hard to separate apocrypha from the truth. Did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX> pay, as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> insist it did, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of thousands of dollars</NUMEX> in back taxes on behalf
of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> who didn't bother to file tax forms? Did an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> really expense
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20,000</NUMEX> in a weeklong trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>? The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who pay the bills are not
talking. But every example of excess cited here was told to me by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>
source (and usually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>) in a position to know.

            Need a
facial? Treat yourself and bill it to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX>. This is what is called "scouting." It
is also a great way to get free haircuts. To be fair, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX> doesn't pay for all
such treats. There is also a much-honored tradition of accepting tribute from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> cover. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exec</ENAMEX> reportedly got so
much loot last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> cigars, "crates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> suits ("<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">It</ENAMEX>
was like a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> galleon")--that he needed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> to cart it home. At
yuletide, even midlevel fashion-mag <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> are inundated with
"cashmere sweaters, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Versace</ENAMEX> pillows, coats ..." recalls one ex- Vogue
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffer wistfully</ENAMEX>.

            
At the top of the masthead, the perks are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perkier</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si-ness</ENAMEX> (their joke, not mine) does not expect his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> to actually live on their <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">million-dollar</NUMEX> salaries. He also gives them
clothing allowances (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $50,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>). He buys them <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> of their choice
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hires chauffeurs</ENAMEX> to drive them. He offers them low- or no-interest home
loans. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GQ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Cooper</ENAMEX> reportedly received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two $1-million</NUMEX> loans,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>, the other for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Brown</ENAMEX> and
her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Evans</ENAMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>, reportedly just
took a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2-million</NUMEX> boost to buy a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.7-million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX>'s
favorite courtiers lead lives of jaw-dropping privilege. When she was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Vogue , Wintour</ENAMEX> commuted between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>--on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Concorde</ENAMEX>. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">confidant</ENAMEX> decided his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> didn't feel right, so he
hired one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmasters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">feng shui</ENAMEX> to rearrange it. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>
prepare for trips by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> Expressing their luggage to their destination.
Why? "So you don't have to carry your bags. No one would be caught dead
carrying a bag."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX> has also created a class of mandarin
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> who live much better than they ever could if they wrote
only for normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-lancer</ENAMEX> tells of building much of a summer
traveling with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> in the West and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> around a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assignments</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last summer</TIMEX>, The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> sent a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffer</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>
to cover the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Venice Film Festival</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeklong</TIMEX> trip, which must have cost
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX>, resulted in a short piece.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Writers</ENAMEX>,
of course, are nowhere near as profligate as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographers</ENAMEX>. Stories of wasteful
shoots abound: the matching seaweed that had to be flown from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> for a fashion photo; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annie Liebovitz Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> cover
shot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Schwarzenegger</ENAMEX> that reportedly cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100,000</NUMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vogue</ENAMEX>
shoot in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> in which, an ex- <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vogue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> claims, the photographer
and his huge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entourage wined</ENAMEX> and dined to the tune of "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of
dollars."

            
And then there are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</TIMEX>
The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> spent--and this is not a joke--<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500,000</NUMEX> on a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-day</TIMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Next Conference</ENAMEX>" at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, in connection
with a special issue on the same theme. In order to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>,
who was traveling in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> at the time, The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> paid
for him and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entourage</ENAMEX> to fly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> and
back. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice presidents</ENAMEX> are not the only things that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX> flies in for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>. The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> once shipped silverware from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> for a dinner. ("<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">What</ENAMEX>, they don't have silverware in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>?" asks a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffer</ENAMEX>.) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> toted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House Correspondents</ENAMEX>
Dinner. (What, they don't have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>?)

            That
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Washington</ENAMEX> do has grown from an after-dinner gathering for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> at a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contributor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> huge blasts--before and after the dinner
itself--at a rented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VF</ENAMEX> 's annual <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar</ENAMEX>-night <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> has become a
similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>. In addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> themselves, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX>
also naturally pays to fly in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> and to put them up at top
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>. (What, they don't have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX>?)

            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> are so ridiculous that even other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cond√© Nasties</ENAMEX> make fun of them. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This week</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> , for example,
mocks a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vogue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> in honor of food <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Steingarten</ENAMEX>.
According to The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wintour</ENAMEX> so detested the carpet at Le
Cirque <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> that she ordered the florist to cover it with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> leaves
(handpicked, of course).

            The apogee of party absurdity
is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> 's sponsorship of an annual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> dinner for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serpentine Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hyde Park.</ENAMEX> As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> puts it, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> ,
an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, pays more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100,000</NUMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> solely so
that it can sponsor a dinner where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graydon Carter</ENAMEX> gets to sit next to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Princess</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">princess</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron</ENAMEX>.

            Actually,
paying <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100,000</NUMEX> for face time with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Di</ENAMEX> may not have been a foolish
investment for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> so dependent on peddling her image. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX>'s
excess has other plausible justifications as well.

            
Some top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> may earn their perks.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogue</ENAMEX> and GQ make <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX>, according to industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> is enjoying banner <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, and while it probably hasn't made
back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the millions</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newhouse</ENAMEX> lost in starting it up, it is certainly in the
black. The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> loses money--how much may even surpass
perks as a topic of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newhouse</ENAMEX> gossip and speculation. On the other hand,
The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> is the most talked-about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Brown</ENAMEX> is the most talked-about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>. That is worth something.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> (or, for that matter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>) can entice
and hold <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> with stock options. Advance is private, so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newhouse</ENAMEX> uses
other golden handcuffs. He runs a lifestyle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>. Top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> stay because
they could never afford to live in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> as nice as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX>'s
interest-free loan bought them, or to host <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> as nice as the ones <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX>'s
party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> throw for them.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> are all about glamour, wealth,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prestige</ENAMEX>. To uphold that image, magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> need to circulate at the top
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> society. But the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> society consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who
make far more money than magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> do--investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX>,
corporate chieftains, and fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Million-dollar</NUMEX> salaries aren't
enough to mix as equals with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trumps</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karans</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX>'s perks are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equalizers</ENAMEX>.

            And they say it's not as good
as it used to be. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Maier</ENAMEX>'s biography of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newhouse</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Self</ENAMEX> held a birthday <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si Newhouse</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> .
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Owners</ENAMEX> ate caviar; <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> drank <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evian</ENAMEX>.) The lowliest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistants</ENAMEX> used to take car
services home. But new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Florio</ENAMEX> has restricted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and
catering. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editors</ENAMEX> who used to fly the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Concorde</ENAMEX> now fly first-class; those who
used to fly first-class now fly business. Expense accounts are scrutinized.
Even so, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX> is economical only by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX> standards. The
belt is tighter, but it's still hand-tooled, hand-tanned, and fashioned from
the finest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> leather.
