            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> used to have
all sorts of irritating habits. If offered a perfectly good
ChÃ¢teauneuf-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">du</ENAMEX>-Pape at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgetown</ENAMEX> dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>, they would praise
it--by stressing their dissent from the "universal opinion" that unblended reds
are better. If told of an especially good trattoria in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, they might
express much gratitude for the information--and deplore their own laziness in
always going to the same old Sabatini they had first encountered while
vacationing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. Even more irritating was the
propensity of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-generation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> for interjecting into any remotely
relevant conversation memories of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Groton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX>, or skiing holidays in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moritz</ENAMEX>.

            There is
none of that sort of thing anymore. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are not wine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">snobs</ENAMEX>--in
fact, many of them prefer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>, while others refrain from even <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, as
befits good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mormons</ENAMEX>. Nor are they partial to foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> in funky
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trattorias</ENAMEX> --cheeseburgers are more their style. Instead of being Ivy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">League</ENAMEX> showoffs, they are quietly proud of their state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX>, however
obscure these might be.

            Unfortunately, much good has also been lost along the way,
including that easy familiarity that comes from an early acquaintance with
foreign ways. It is one thing to read up on, say, current <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> policy for the
airliner industry, and to start from scratch. It is quite another if the new
information is layered over personal experiences with things <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> going back
to teen-age visits, junior-year-abroad touring, or even years of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> with
expatriate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>.

            This
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX> might be what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Lake</ENAMEX> had in mind when, in the course of his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">abortive</ENAMEX> confirmation hearings, he remarked that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s "pool of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX>,
particularly in languages and cultural knowledge, is getting very thin." The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> had little difficulty in replacing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX> as its candidate
to head the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> is much less likely to overcome its personnel problem,
which affects its quality as an intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> far more than the
choice of the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> ever could.

            
When it comes to the operational side of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s work--mostly the recruitment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in place--it is certainly more
difficult to strike just the right tone with a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomat</ENAMEX> or functionary
without a broader background than can be gained in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake City</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Dayton</ENAMEX>. Of
course, most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> whom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> must strive to understand--or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recruit</ENAMEX>--are not suave <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> but rather <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thugs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">weapons</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traffickers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, and the
like. But even with these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>, the challenge is to interpret and manipulate
motivations, urges, obsessions, and priorities that drastically diverge from
those prevalent among the middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of middle <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, the source of most
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.

            To be
sure, there is plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and in every level
of society. Yet, a narrow provincialism seems to be the hallmark of younger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason is simply that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX> are much more likely to be
approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> if they have lived in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place
all their lives, with no prior foreign travel or foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> (each of
which must be reported in detail, no matter how routine the travel or how
casual the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact</ENAMEX>). Moreover, there seems to be a distinct preference for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX> who resemble the security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> themselves--exceptionally
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sober people</ENAMEX> who have never danced in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> disco, never had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX>, and never tried smoking pot while in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">college</ENAMEX>.

            In other words, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> is now screening out exactly the
sort of people it used to actively recruit: venturesome young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> with as
much foreign experience as possible.

            Because
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">espionage</ENAMEX> is such a small part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> of intelligence--as compared
with the purely intellectual work of analysis--none of the above would matter
very much if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> could still attract the smartest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX> from the best
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>. But those days are long past. The Ivy League <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX> who used
to fill its ranks now mostly want to become investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX>: It is there
that the adventure lies--as well as the money, of course. Nothing can be done
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> that. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> could do much better if it pursued diversity in its
recruiting, not the by-the-numbers diversity of so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX> but, rather, a diversity of experience.

            
Plenty of young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have lived abroad
from childhood with their corporate-executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, and many others have
done so as post-college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> for Third World relief and developmental
outfits. Many <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> currently live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prague</ENAMEX>,
and other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX>, enjoying the excitements of their
post-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> transition, excitements that include the abundance of attractive
sexual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> eager to connect with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Westerners</ENAMEX>. At present, most such
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX> are rejected if they seek to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, as are nontypical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX> in general--security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> find that their background is
just too complicated.

            One
reject was asked earnestly why on earth he had gone to live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prague</ENAMEX> after
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">graduation</ENAMEX>, surviving on odd jobs instead of starting a career back home. When
he jokingly responded with "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>," the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> did not conceal their
shocked disapproval. When he dropped the ill-received jocularity to say that he
had wanted, having grown up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX>, to live awhile in one of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">world</ENAMEX>'s most beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, they were openly disbelieving--they had never
been to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prague</ENAMEX> of course, and apparently, they did not know of its
architectural splendors, either.

            Amore egregious case is that of an adventurous and quite
brilliant young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>. She had worked for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugee</ENAMEX>-relief project in the most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lawless</ENAMEX> region of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Asia</ENAMEX> before finding her way into an even more dangerous
part of the world--one of great importance for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> foreign policy. She became
so interested in the area's ongoing struggle and the local culture that she
decided to study it systematically, exiting from her marriage to return there.
She made a great number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, from village <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to guerrilla <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>,
multiplying the number of "foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX>" she faithfully reported on the
security form required of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX>. That in the process she had
learned what makes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> tick--as well as a language known to few, if any,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>--was of no account: Her chances of being hired would have been
much better if she had remained celibate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake City</ENAMEX>.

            The nondrinking, nonsmoking,
noncarousing, and mostly monolingual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of today do not have the
vices of either their more adventurous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contemporaries</ENAMEX> or their flamboyant Ivy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">League</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX>, but it is really unfair to expect them to cope with all
those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> out there.
