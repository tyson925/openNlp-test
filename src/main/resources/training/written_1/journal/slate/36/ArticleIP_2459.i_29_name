            Artificial intelligence
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expert Keith Devlin</ENAMEX> wrote that a computer will never be able to tell the
difference between "time flies like an arrow" and "fruit flies like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX>." Add
to this mix "she unzipped their flies like there was no <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>," and you get
some idea of the challenge faced by software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> hawking filters to
protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> from the nastiness on the Web. The filters are supposed to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> access to sites <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> wouldn't want their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to see.

            The Web
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> has insisted that government regulation of pornographic Web
content--as in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Communications Decency Act</ENAMEX>--is unnecessary because
software filters can do the job. Now that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> has ruled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDA</ENAMEX>
unconstitutional, that bluff has been called. Do filters work? And which ones
work best?

            In essence, all filter programs work like search engines in
reverse, keeping out anything with certain words or combinations of letters.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sussex County Fair</ENAMEX> Web page has been blocked by filters because it contains
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> letters s<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">-e-x.</ENAMEX> The breast-cancer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors group</ENAMEX> found its discussion
blocked by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">America Online</ENAMEX> (which quickly apologized). Even the Web page for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Encarta</ENAMEX> encyclopedia has been blocked, presumably because somewhere
there was a mention of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">s-e</ENAMEX>-x or even b-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">r-e</ENAMEX>-a-s-t-s.

            Software
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different approaches to marketing the filter programs. One
evokes law enforcement. This category includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SurfWatch</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cyber</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patrol</ENAMEX> (motto: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">To Surf and Protect"</ENAMEX>), which operates from a screen that looks
like the command <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rescue 911</ENAMEX> . Other filters evoke <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Poppins</ENAMEX>,
with names like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CYBERsitter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Net Nanny</ENAMEX>. Despite its cozy name, CYBERsitter
is in one way the strictest of the programs: It's a tattletale. The software
keeps a log of the sites the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> has attempted to access, "including attempts
to access blocked material." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Net Nanny</ENAMEX>'s more liberal approach is indicated by
its two-pronged motto: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Best Way To Protect Your Children And Free Speech</ENAMEX>
On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Net</ENAMEX>." It provides <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> with a suggested list of sites to exclude, but
nothing is excluded without being specifically designated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. As a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spokesperson</ENAMEX> told me in an e-mail, "We do not automatically block, as that
would be infringing on your rights." Think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Poppins</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilith Fair</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T-shirt</ENAMEX>.

            
All the filters are designed to block sites
with explicitly sexual text or pictures, and most also screen out sites dealing
with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, hate speech, and gambling. Filters fail in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways:
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-inclusiveness--blocking sites that shouldn't be blocked--and
under-inclusiveness--letting bad stuff through. All the filter products claim
to have sophisticated algorithms to avoid these pitfalls. The challenge is in
applying a formulaic approach to a heavily context-sensitive sorting problem.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyber Patrol</ENAMEX> says that it excludes sites that advocate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use or bigotry, but
that it does not exclude "opinion or educational material, such as the
historical use of marijuana or the circumstances surrounding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">anti-Semitic Germany</ENAMEX>." As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Devlin</ENAMEX>'s example shows, this is easier in theory than
in practice. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CYBERsitter</ENAMEX>, which touts its sophisticated content-based filters,
blocks all sites with the word "anarchy."

            But
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-inclusiveness is less troubling to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> than under-inclusiveness. In
testing each of the filters I was able to pull up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-rated</ENAMEX> material without much
effort. Filters may prevent access to certain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, but blocked <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> can show
up when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> use search engines, and there is nothing to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> from
reading the raunchy descriptions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> or writing down the Web addresses
and going off to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>--or to the local public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, which, in
keeping with cherished anti-censorship policies, probably doesn't use filter
software.

            Filters can protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> from accidentally (or
intentionally) visiting a Web site that includes material deemed inappropriate
by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, but they are limited to what we might term the "pull" side.
The bigger problem is on the "push" side, and there the filters are helpless.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> in my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Cub Scout</ENAMEX> troop received, via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> e-mail, a photograph of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> having sex. It was sent as a joke by an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> he knew. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, then
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>, participated in a sports discussion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Prodigy</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was
exceptionally kind and protective, except for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX>, who was cut off
by the discussion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> for general obnoxiousness. He retaliated by using a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">free AOL</ENAMEX> account to send <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> copies of an obscene e-mail to everyone who had
ever participated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prodigy</ENAMEX> discussion, including my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>.

            Coming
soon are filters based on criteria developed by particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> will
be able to select from filters endorsed by anyone from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian Coalition</ENAMEX>
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Education Association</ENAMEX>. Ultimately, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the W3C</TIMEX> plan, developed by
the international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Wide Web Consortium</ENAMEX>, will provide standard ratings, to
be assigned to each page by its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developer</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> will be able to set their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">browsers</ENAMEX> to deny access to pages without ratings. And so they can breathe
easier, knowing that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> will only be able to see pages certified as
suitable by their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX>.

            
Meanwhile, you can download trial versions of
filter software to find the one you like best. That decision will be based more
on your technical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> than on your notions of what material you want your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to see, because the programs vary much more in their dependence on
parental tweaking than on their approaches to excluding material. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> who
are less adept than their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> at using the Internet will probably prefer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CYBERsitter</ENAMEX>. It errs
on the side of exclusion, and was especially thorough at preventing even the
results of Web searches that included inappropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">URLs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> who are
willing to devote the time to setting their own parameters will be better off
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cyber Patrol</ENAMEX>. It
allows separate settings for separate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, important for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with older
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of different ages. It also makes it possible for parents
to block outgoing information, to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> from revealing their last names,
phone numbers, addresses, and passwords in an online chat. Ultimately, though,
even the best filters are a limited and temporary solution. None are as
effective as good communication and (maybe even more important) keeping the
family computer in a central location so that all surfing is done within
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">earshot</ENAMEX>.

            But filters aren't just for
concerned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. The cover story in the last issue of the business magazine
Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> identifies nonbusiness-related use of the Web as a
serious problem at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. Among the most frequent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penthouse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s Web site are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> statistic floating around is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> spend about
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 minutes a day</TIMEX> on nonwork-related computer games and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> surfing, with an
estimated productivity cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50 billion</NUMEX>. And, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SurfWatch</ENAMEX>'s promotional
literature is happy to point out, filters can help protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> from
liability for permitting sexually explicit material in the workplace. The real
market for filters isn't <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX>--it's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dilbert</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>.
