            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Weeks</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX>
buried the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>-Feingold campaign-finance reform bill in parliamentary
procedure, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> of political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>,
advocacy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, and campaign-finance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> were already figuring out how to
peck the law to death if it passed.

            And peck
they would have. At <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain-Feingold</ENAMEX> seemed the perfect antidote
to the recent fund-raising scandals at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and the national party
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committees</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain-Feingold</ENAMEX>'s nobly conceived ban on soft-money
contributions (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">funds</NUMEX> designated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> for nonfederal use, including
party <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and state-election activity) and its restrictions on issue
advertisements would have changed little.

            Currently, election law permits national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party committees</ENAMEX>
such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Committee</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Committee</ENAMEX>
to accept unlimited soft-money contributions and redirect them. But
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain-Feingold</ENAMEX>'s prohibitions on soft money would have merely moved the
fund-raising action to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, because the bill does not regulate state
party <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> have state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party committees</ENAMEX> in
every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Created as separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> from their national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>,
they are in large part regulated by state law. Generally, state law is more
permissive than federal law. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> allow
corporate contributions and labor contributions, while federal law prohibits
such contributions. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have no limits on the amount that may be
contributed. Usually, a national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party committee</ENAMEX> does not use its soft money to
directly support state or local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. Instead, a national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> committee
transfers those funds to state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party committees</ENAMEX>, which in turn support state
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>.

            To evade
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain-Feingold</ENAMEX>'s soft-money ban, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> would cut out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">middleman</ENAMEX> and
make their donations directly to the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party committee</ENAMEX>. Although
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain-Feingold</ENAMEX> prohibits a national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party committee</ENAMEX> from "directing"
soft-money contributions to others, it does not prohibit national and state
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committees</ENAMEX> from coordinating in other ways. For example, a national party
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committee</ENAMEX> could still coordinate the fund-raising efforts of the various state
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> and exchange information, as long as it did not solicit or direct
contributions to those state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain-Feingold</ENAMEX> also does not prohibit one
state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> from coordinating and directing contributions with others. Because
the law doesn't require state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party committees</ENAMEX> to be located within their
respective <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, they might well open <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>, to
coordinate fund-raising efforts. Imagine a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">scenario</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>'
state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party committees</ENAMEX> set up a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> representing all of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party committees</ENAMEX>, rent space from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNC</ENAMEX>, and hire their own
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fund-raisers</ENAMEX>. I'm sure this idea has already dawned on the state party
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committees</ENAMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feingold</ENAMEX> passed, the party <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> could conduct
business as usual with the slight inconvenience of rearranging lease agreements
and adjusting the names on their payrolls.

            Under
current federal election law, expenditures on issue-related speech--that is,
ads that don't expressly advocate the election or defeat of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> by
using words such as "vote for," "elect," or "defeat"--are exempt from the
prohibition on corporate contributions and the limits on individual
contributions. (The exemption does not apply if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> behind the ad
coordinated it with a campaign.) An ad that identifies a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> and
discusses his voting record on an issue is not subject to election-law
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prohibitions</ENAMEX> and limits unless words of express advocacy are used.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain-Feingold</ENAMEX> would ban all such issue-related ads that
air <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 days</TIMEX> prior to an election and clearly identify or depict a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>.
But any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> worth his <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> could evade this restriction. First, he'd
create and air all of his issue advertisements outside the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60-day</TIMEX> period.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, he'd be creative about the contents of the ads he broadcast inside the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60-day</TIMEX> period. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain-Feingold</ENAMEX> does not ban ads inside the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60-day</TIMEX> period that
discuss important issues in an election without identifying a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>. Once
again, it's easy to imagine party <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> and advocacy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> making
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inventive</ENAMEX> and persuasive ads that don't depict or refer to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, but
strike the same themes as the campaign's ads established outside the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60-day</TIMEX>
period.

            Ultimately, campaign-finance
laws only inconvenience campaigns as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> figure out how to circumvent
them and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> dismantle them as threats to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> rights to free
speech. The heap of rules and prohibitions that survive these challenges are
subject to the law of unintended consequences, usually causing an effect that
is the opposite of the original intention.

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Money</ENAMEX> is like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>," said
former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Ickes</ENAMEX> about campaign finance in a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York</ENAMEX>
Times Magazine profile. "If there is a crack <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> will find it. Same way
with political money."
