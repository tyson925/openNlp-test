            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culturebox</ENAMEX> took a certain amount of heat from you, dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, for her

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paean</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> to the electronic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby sitter</ENAMEX>--television, that is--and for
calling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> "annoying little buggers." Your most common reaction: "This is
precisely the defeatist type of attitude that could eventually bring the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">beloved American</ENAMEX> civilization down." Your <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> most common reaction: "Maybe
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judith Shulevich</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like her who think of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> as
'annoying little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buggers</ENAMEX>' should think about sterilization." Those who didn't
advocate voluntary tubal ligation (I hope that was what you were advocating)
thought religion was in order.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culturebox</ENAMEX> will appeal to history, that defense of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scoundrels</ENAMEX>, to argue that
television seems a pretty harmless way to distract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, at least when you
compare it to the alternatives. Here are a few of the methods of
child-restraint practiced by our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forefathers</ENAMEX> and foremothers--many of whom were
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">patriotic</ENAMEX>, religious, and of high moral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>: swaddling their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>,
depriving them of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> (it was thought to keep babies quiet), tying them to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">chairs</ENAMEX>, and beating them severely. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> persisted in bawling or shitting
or generally irking, it could be assumed they were changelings--spawns of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">devil</ENAMEX>--in which case they were turned out of doors or killed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> were
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">routinely</ENAMEX> told horrifying tales about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gruesome creatures</ENAMEX> lurking nearby, ready
to devour them if they so much as left their beds. A popular technique for
moral edification was taking a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to a public execution.

            The tender empathy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s every need and want that we take for
granted is little over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century old</TIMEX>--about the same age as psychoanalysis and
the notion of child-care expertise. It is due for revision. A return to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exorcism</ENAMEX> may be excessive, but there is plenty of evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are
hardier than previously thought (see, for instance, this essay
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judith Rich Harris</ENAMEX>, or read her book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Nurture Assumption: Why Children Turn Out the Way They</ENAMEX>
Do ). Besides, in the immortal words of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,
too. Without that acknowledgement, we may all be doomed to live life in the
manner of this <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Culturebox</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>--who lost my sympathy, I'm sorry to say, as
soon as he called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">me Judy :</ENAMEX>

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy</ENAMEX>, bringing up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> is supposed to be very, very hard. You
aren't supposed to have free time. Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> should not rest worry-free on your
pillow <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX>. Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> should not understand how hard you work or the
sacrifices you make for her. You gave up your entitlement to these things when
you brought another little human into the world who relies <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 percent</NUMEX> on you
for her livelihood and education. If you're put out by bringing up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, it's
because you're selfish, or lazy, or immature, or made a big mistake when you
weren't prepared to handle the consequences. Go spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every waking hour</TIMEX> with
your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, and bitch about your hectic life in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteen years</TIMEX>.
            

            
               Ahab I am: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culturebox</ENAMEX> has met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX>--has put him up in her
home!--and can vouch for the likelihood of his 
sanguine reaction to The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair Witch</ENAMEX> Project . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> is a man
blessed with an enviably cheerful temperament. Not for him the excesses of
Gothic supernaturalism or ridiculous stories of ghosts, stick figures, and
things that go bump in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culturebox</ENAMEX> is admittedly, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edgar Allan Poe</ENAMEX>
once wrote, "nervous--very, very dreadfully nervous." Whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> seems
to share the blissfully indifferent sensibilities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polynesian</ENAMEX> islander
Queequeg, celebrated thusly by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman Melville in Moby Dick</ENAMEX> : "Savages
are strange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX>; at times you do not know exactly how to take them. At first
they are overawing; their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Socratic</ENAMEX> wisdom ... [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Queequeg</ENAMEX>] seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the
utmost serenity; content with his own companionship; always equal to himself.
Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard
there was such a thing as that."
