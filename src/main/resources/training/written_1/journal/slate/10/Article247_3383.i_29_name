            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hi Jim</ENAMEX>:

            My heartfelt condolences at the passing of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of your beloved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fat
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ladies</ENAMEX>, not to mention your poker losses.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> other notable feature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> ' obit: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nemy</ENAMEX> takes pains to
point out the negative results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> ' own taste test of the
recipe book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cooking With the Two Fat Ladies</ENAMEX> . A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> found that no less
than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> recipes she tested didn't work. " 'It is their rapid
rise here, of course, that makes this careless effort at a cookbook so
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">regrettable</ENAMEX>,' " the obit quotes the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> Times piece.

            Excuse the expression: This is a fine example of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>' having
its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX> and eating it too. Even in death, there's opportunity to tut-tut about
the ill effects of celebrity run amok, namely unleashing bad recipes on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">masses</ENAMEX>, while simultaneously celebrating that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX> in the form of a
prominent obituary complete with a photo of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motorcycle</ENAMEX>
and sidecar.

            Still, you can't find that much fault in an appreciation of a life that ends
with this quote from the surviving fat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> about her deceased <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX>: "She didn't see the point of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. She'd rather have caviar."

            As a coda to our conversation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> about the perils of technology run
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">amok</ENAMEX>, see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Work & Family"</ENAMEX> column in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> ,
in which "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Technology Junkie Learns To Live Life a Little Less Plugged in.</ENAMEX>" We
hear the tale of a project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US West</ENAMEX>, who's spent his career finding
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> to use technology but in the process found himself a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX>
to the machine.

            In the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> for chest pains, this tech junkie panics about his
lost cell phone, not the about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of his health. The piece is about how one
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> learned to "find the 'off' button" without quitting his job. Here's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>
for the digital age--a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who saw the light, and while he still reads e-mail
and listens to voicemail on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> and on vacation, he sometimes doesn't
even respond to it. Can you imagine? To be fair, the profile subject says of
himself, "I'm not a success story yet, but I recognize the issues."

            As for your ruminations on the effects of competitive jealousy on news
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">judgment</ENAMEX>, I'd have to agree that there's something out of whack if a story like
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paducah</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bomb factory</ENAMEX> goes so wildly under-reported in other
papers, just because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> broke it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> don't really care who
broke a story, only other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> do.

            But I ask the business question: Can you see any way that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> might
change how they operate to better balance such behind-the-scenes professional
competition with serving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>? After all, no one wins awards for putting out
me-too stories.
