            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Walter</ENAMEX>,

            Your comments bring to mind the "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekend Journal</ENAMEX>" section of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>
Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> , otherwise known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consumer</ENAMEX> 
               Reports
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richie Rich</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX>--which debuted just after the boom really started
to boom--is a weekly tutorial on how to blow surplus cash. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This summer</TIMEX>'s
editions have included primers on how to purchase the splashiest inground
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pools</ENAMEX>, the smokiest mega-grills, and the preppiest Adirondack chairs. The
stories exemplify the macho, leave-the-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Joneses</ENAMEX>-in-the-dust attitude on which
you so charmingly riff.

            But needless to say, only the prosperous are bored with prosperity. What
dissatisfied me about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s otherwise excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> piece was the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> it toggled between haves, have-somes, and have-nots, without acknowledging
that riskiness is attractive to each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for very different reasons. Risks
such as adventure travel may be entertaining for the rich; but for the rest of
us, risks (such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> trading) are mostly a way to try and become rich. Just
because both activities involve some sort of danger doesn't make them a unified
trend. That's something I find consistently annoying about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">newsweekly</ENAMEX> writing--the way perfectly interesting yet discrete phenomena have
to be conflated into Something Larger or a movement that is Sweeping the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nation</ENAMEX>.

            Do you really think <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are as bored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> as we seem to
be by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is such a flirt, all mystery and anecdote. His personality
is appealingly provocative--the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mini-Me</ENAMEX> bit is great, as are a couple of
moments in his profile in Talk (apparently he once grabbed a rival by
the collar, drew him close, and yelled, "If you want to fuck me you'll have to
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">kiss me</ENAMEX> first!").

            And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has roped what seems like every political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>
into a guessing game about his actual beliefs. Someone should keep a tally of
the hunches ... how about us? From now on, I say we place each <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> profile we
read into one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> categories: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conservative</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moderate</ENAMEX>, and Empty
Vessel.

            Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>,
