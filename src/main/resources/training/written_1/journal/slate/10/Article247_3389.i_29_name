            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hi Jim</ENAMEX>:

            I, too, am enjoying the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">We Are the World</ENAMEX>" eclipse coverage. This from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reuters</ENAMEX>: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Druids</ENAMEX> danced, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> prayed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindus</ENAMEX> bathed, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> stopped work and took to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> as an eerie twilight followed by
darkness covered their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about noon</TIMEX>."

            Just as we <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> expected: Those <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> will use any occasion as an
excuse to stop working. They probably all went right home and took naps
afterwards, too. If the eclipse had happened here, of course, we would have
just taken our cell phones and other gadgets outside and kept right on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multitasking</ENAMEX>.

            But since you're tired of all this technology talk, nature boy, back to my
original obsession of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX>--the morbid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco Examiner</ENAMEX> death
watch. Here's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more reason to frown at the prospect of losing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">daily</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Examiner</ENAMEX> carries a front-page investigative piece
that's the latest installment in their ongoing coverage of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> probe into
city contracting abuses, involving real estate development. At the center of
the action is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Walker</ENAMEX>, a local <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> and longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie Brown</ENAMEX>, who is seeking re-election.

            Incidentally, in a troubling sign of the times for journalism, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker</ENAMEX> refuses to be interviewed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Examiner</ENAMEX> unless they agree to
pay him <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250,000</NUMEX> if he's misquoted. He's clearly ever the smart business
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.

            Anyway, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Examiner</ENAMEX> piece reveals that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> has now expanded
to investigate various potential developments on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> waterfront.
What's so hysterical about this piece of gritty <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> reporting, the kind of
thing that makes true-blue newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types bluster</ENAMEX> with civic pride, is that on
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">very same day</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> carries a puff piece about
the development of the self-same waterfront: "In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, Great Views and
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferry</ENAMEX>."

            In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Examiner</ENAMEX> story, port <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Wong</ENAMEX> appears scheduling a
hearing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Walker</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">crony</ENAMEX>'s development projects, which is
apparently now under investigation. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> , the same
official <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Wong</ENAMEX> demures that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port administrators offices</ENAMEX> won't be housed in
the newly renovated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ferry Building</ENAMEX>, because the real estate is just too
valuable (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$60</NUMEX> per square foot), and they'll settle for lesser waterfront views
down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$46</NUMEX> per square foot). How modest.

            While the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> chases a story involving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">waterfront</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> finds in the same waterfront a tale
of a city re-inventing itself through heroic redevelopment. It's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tragicomic</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KM</ENAMEX>
