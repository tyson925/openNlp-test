            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Jim</ENAMEX>:

            With the eclipse behind us, I'm glad to see that you are finding other
outlets for your nature appreciation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYC</ENAMEX>, even if it is limited to clucking
over coverage of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Park</ENAMEX>'s poisoned <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>.

            Here's what I don't understand about the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buford O. Furrow Jr.</ENAMEX> A guy
shows up to a psychiatric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> apparently for treatment and then threatens
to stab the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. Arrested following this assault, he confesses racist
fantasies to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>, telling them: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sometimes</ENAMEX> I feel like I could just lose
it and kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>." He then goes to jail for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">165 days</TIMEX>. Less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five months</TIMEX>
after his release, he loses it and goes on a racist shooting spree.

            Didn't anyone--the cops or the threatened psychiatric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>--suggest any
further evaluation of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s marbles? And if so, where's the evidence of
it? None of the news reports I've read give any real details about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX>'s or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital's</ENAMEX> records of this fine moment of community policing and mental health
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> just cites the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesperson</ENAMEX> for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> that convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buford</ENAMEX> saying that he couldn't be held in
jail any longer for his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-offense crime of assault.

            True, my reaction may be the worst kind of post-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mayhem 20-20</NUMEX> hindsight: "Why
didn't someone do something?!" Who knows? Maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> violent racists a day show
up in the average clink claiming they have fantasies of killing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, and
it's impossible to know whom to take seriously. But it's incredible to think
that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who is so out of control when he brings himself to a mental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
that he's arrested doesn't go right back into a mental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> or some kind of
treatment.

            I'm sure, as the details emerge, we're going to read a lot stories about the
whacked cultural and political climate of our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> that allows a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with
such a history to get ahold of not just a gun, but a vanful of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>.

            But here's another article that I'd like to read. At what point does the
mental health profession step in, if at all, when cops hear this kind of
violent fantasy from an obviously violent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>? How does the whole process work?
And what would it have taken to have sent this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> not just to jail for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">165</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> but to have his head examined?

            Then, I want to read an article about exactly how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cabs</ENAMEX> there are in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX> and where they are all hiding.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yours</ENAMEX> in breakfast,
Katharine
