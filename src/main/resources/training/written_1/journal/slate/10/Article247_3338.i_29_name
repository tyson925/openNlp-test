            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Walter</ENAMEX>,

            If you know so much about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Senate</ENAMEX> race, then please tell me who
is going to win.

            Speaking of playing dirty, don't misquote me. I wrote that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> was a
"more complex and appealing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>" than your cartoonish description dictated. And
I only praised <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX>'s press strategy for instilling the kind of staff
loyalty that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> so desperately needs; I duly noted that it's "overly
suspicious and vituperative."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter</ENAMEX>, have you read and written so much about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> matchup
that you've become inured to its potential drama? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C'mon</ENAMEX>, it's so basic: male
vs. female, local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> vs. national figure, technocrat vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idealist</ENAMEX>. Both
are trying to recast themselves dramatically: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> from her post as a
political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> and amateur policy wonk, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudy</ENAMEX> from his job as hands-on city
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>. Does the idea of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first lady</ENAMEX> winning elected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> not intrigue you
at all? And even you admit to some interest in how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> might possibly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-fashion himself into a good party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX>.

            It sounds like you've already imagined this campaign down to the suits the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> will wear in their commercials. But no one really knows how these
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> will perform, or how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> will receive them. They're both familiar
figures yet somewhat unknown quantities (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudy</ENAMEX> as
anything but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX>). Sure, this suspense may evaporate with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stumping</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>-kissing--it could become <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Messinger</ENAMEX> redux, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D'Amato-Schumer</ENAMEX> writ larger and uglier. But right now, it's all
anticipation.

            Does it trouble you that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> is running as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first lady</ENAMEX>? It troubles me
that so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> are so troubled by it. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JFK Jr.</ENAMEX>'s
death I heard a slew of talk-show <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> praise "the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s premier political dynasty" in one breath, and condemn <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX>'s
candidacy in the next, on the grounds that she is cynically leveraging her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s name and connections to get herself elected. How did the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> kids
or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> win <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>? What about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Bono</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lurleen Wallace</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX>
who stepped directly into their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX>? If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> used White
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> funds for travel or other campaign-related needs, then we'd have an
ethical lapse to discuss (and a lapse of common sense. Given her history of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">financial</ENAMEX> scandal, she'd be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool</ENAMEX> to do anything improper). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nepotism</ENAMEX> is unfair
by definition, but it's even less fair to level those charges selectively.

            Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>,

            P.S.: On the death announcements: Maybe some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are indeed too
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disconsolate</ENAMEX> to write meaningful prose. But plenty of eulogies contain good
copy. So I still don't see why death announcements can't honor the departed in
the same way.
