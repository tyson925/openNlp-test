            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> have been receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>-glove treatment from
the press thus far. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of them, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX>, are conventional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX>-favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. They're underdogs whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> like and respect.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>, has been winning glowing notices for different
reasons. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Journalists</ENAMEX>, who expect W. to win the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> nomination and maybe the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">presidency</ENAMEX>, are ingratiating themselves with his campaign for the sake of
future access. They're also genuinely curious about the phenomenon of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s
popularity and are trying to explain it--starting from the premise that it must
be justified.

            A fine example of how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> gets the benefit of the doubt not available to,
say, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tucker Carlson</ENAMEX>'s profile in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> issue of Talk .
This isn't actually a bad article. Reading it, you get a better sense of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>
as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> than from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> of words lavished upon him by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Monthly</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> . It is nonetheless a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">classic</ENAMEX> puffer, which sets out to depict <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s decency and compassion rather
than question whether these qualities are, in fact, genuine. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlson</ENAMEX> describes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.</ENAMEX> as the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who cries when talking about his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and loves telling
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX> contributors to quit being so damned selfish.

            He is also, apparently, the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who thinks that a condemned woman
begging for her life is knee-slappingly hilarious. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlson</ENAMEX> recounts asking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>
about his handling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karla Faye Tucker</ENAMEX> episode <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tucker</ENAMEX>, you may
recall, was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rehabilitated axe murderess</ENAMEX> whose faith-based request for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clemency Bush</ENAMEX> chose not to grant despite pleas from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Robertson</ENAMEX> (which
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paradoxically</ENAMEX> made him more eager to execute her--the better to distance
himself from the religious right). Here's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlson</ENAMEX>'s recounting of the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mimicked Tucker</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eleventh-hour</TIMEX> appearance on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Larry King Live : "Please</ENAMEX>,"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> whimpers, his lips pursed in mock desperation, "don't kill me."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlson</ENAMEX> uses this vignette to make the point that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has a long memory for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">slights</ENAMEX>, in this case the lethal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">injectee</ENAMEX>'s accusation that he was caving to
election-year pressure by signing her death warrant. Absent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.</ENAMEX>'s halo effect, I
think a different spin might have suggested itself: If this is compassionate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conservatism</ENAMEX>, what on earth is the heartless kind like?
