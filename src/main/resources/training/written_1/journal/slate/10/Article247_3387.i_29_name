            For the moment, the carnage in the Internet and technology sector seems to
have ended. Although <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> belonged almost entirely to real technology
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cisco</ENAMEX> (which I own shares of) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX>, Net stocks didn't
really lose ground, and a few--most notably <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America Online</ENAMEX>--had strong upward
moves. So while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>- or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-point moves up may be gone (perhaps
forever), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of forced margin calls and panic selling seem to be
temporarily behind us as well.

            Even as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> and much of the rest of the market has been decimated
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past couple of weeks</TIMEX>, I haven't written anything about it, because I
didn't think there was anything interesting to add. When you combine rising
interest rates, concerns about inflation, and a market that had priced in a lot
of good news, you shouldn't be surprised when high-priced stocks take a
hit.

            As for Net stocks in particular, they offer no solace to the scared investor
who looks for reassurance when bad things--like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> outage, or the
rumor about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> offering free Net access--happen. There are no profits
(with, again, the exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX>) and no long track records, and in recent
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> there's even been talk that Net usage is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonal</TIMEX> (slow in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>).
The fundamental irony about Net stocks, after all, is that investing in them is
an investment in the future, and a future that's really still <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> away. But
most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> investing in them appear to have time horizons that extend
no further than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the week</TIMEX>, if they're lucky. That's an incredibly
unstable combination.

            More substantively, the Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX>--and arguably tech stocks in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>--has been hurt by the sheer number of new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> going public. This
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> IPOs were supposed to be priced, which is simply a staggering number.
Pick up any Monday <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past month</TIMEX>, and check out the
"equity offerings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>" column, and you'll be astonished--at least I
always am--at how many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> are trying to tap the public markets in a time
of relative weakness.

            A lot has been written on the effect of this IPO glut on stock prices. But
the more interesting question is why a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> would want to go public right
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX>. After all, IPOs are breaking through their offering prices (that is,
closing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first day</TIMEX> of trading below where they were initially sold), and all
the high-flyers of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>--iVillage, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TheStreet</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marketwatch</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TheGlobe</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>--have been crushed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few months</TIMEX>. On top of that, it's
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>, traditionally <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the worst month</TIMEX> to go public and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a bad month</TIMEX> to do
anything in the market, since so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> are on vacation. So why rush?
