            Katharine,

            Good questions all.

            I had a similar reaction to the quotes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acquaintances</ENAMEX>. Although there were some of the garden-variety "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">He</ENAMEX> seemed like
such a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>," more were along the lines of: "Oh yeah, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buford</ENAMEX>, he's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a really</TIMEX>
virulent racist." I don't count among any of my acquaintances <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who openly
espouse hatred for entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">races</ENAMEX> or ethnicities. If someone I cared about did, I
think I would try to change his or her mind, and if that didn't work, they'd be
off my list.

            Please understand: I'm not saying that my world is typical. As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of
the urban media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX>, I live in a kind of protected bubble. I also know that
bigotry runs deep and weird in almost all of us, and of course I've been around
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> whose ignorance and insensitivities have made me uncomfortable or
angry.

            But still: Is it the common <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> experience to know someone reasonably
well who's a race-hater? Do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> often say, "My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> believes in the
intrinsic inferiority of the lower orders, but he's a really fun <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>"? This
isn't to suggest that there's any obligation--as you say about the mental
health profession--to intervene against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who hold racist beliefs. I'm
more fascinated by the process through which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> explain these things to
themselves.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> more tidbit for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarket tabloid</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> is
reporting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX>, who recently filed for divorce from his second
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, has been conducting an affair for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least three years</TIMEX> with Callista
Bisek, a congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffer</ENAMEX> 23 years his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junior</ENAMEX>. A priceless moment in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Post</ENAMEX>'s account: "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bisek</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-foot-8</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blonde</ENAMEX>, was not responsible for the breakup. 'His marriage was a mess
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beforehand</ENAMEX>,' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> said." Thanks for telling us now--whatever
happened to family values?

            Assuming this stuff is true, can you fathom the chutzpah of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who led
the charge against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>'s affair with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX>--at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point
saying the relationship showed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> is a misogynist--while he was
carrying on in a very similar fashion himself? God, I miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX>.

            Best,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jim</ENAMEX>
