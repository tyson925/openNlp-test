            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> leads with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gunman</ENAMEX>'s automatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> attack on a day
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">camp</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Fernando Valley</ENAMEX>, which wounded an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-ager</ENAMEX>, and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. The story off-leads the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> .
Big pictures of police leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to post-attack safety adorn the fronts.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> run versions of the same striking photo, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">quintessential L.A.</ENAMEX> news helicopter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POV</ENAMEX> depicting a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> holding hands
on their way to safety, recalling an icon of pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uzi</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">school days</TIMEX>--a string of
paper dolls. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">USAT</ENAMEX> leads with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> warning both the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> not to cut domestic spending. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> lead is
that with party control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Representatives</ENAMEX> at stake in the next
election, fund-raising for congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">races</ENAMEX> is off to an early and record
start. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> runs a similar piece inside, leading instead with a story
it has paid more prominent attention to than any one else--the on-the-ground
situation in postwar <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s effort claims that recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX>
peacekeeping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> have made strides in containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLA</ENAMEX> and in establishing
civil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, especially by paying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> who've
gone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> without. The thin line being tightroped by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> explains the
paper, is to assert its sole administrative authority without turning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLA</ENAMEX>
into an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX>.

            In their shootings stories, both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> and the WP make the
near-ritual "it could have been worse" point--in this case because many of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> ordinarily at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> were off on a field trip. The papers frame
the episode with all the other mass shootings that have made news in the past
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year or so</TIMEX>, and report that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX> did the same. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> lead editorial tries to apply
the emotion of the moment to the cause of tighter gun control, but the effort
is stalked by a lack of tighter prose control. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> claims that "all of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>" through following the incident. And then wraps up
wondering, "Will it take the shooting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">innocents</ENAMEX> in every congressional
district before national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX>" do something?--as if all those shootings
hadn't already happened.

            As of press time <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX>, the white male middle-aged shooting suspect
remained at large, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> released his name and said he was a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Because <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> camp was in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> community
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> is investigating whether or not the shooting was technically a
hate crime. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> says that as yet there is no evidence supporting
this. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> , taking advantage of its time-zone-based later close,
reports that there is: In a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> linked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shooter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> found a book
written by a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Nazi Party</ENAMEX>. Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>
report that there was also a very large amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ammunition</ENAMEX> found in the
vehicle--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000 to 4,000</NUMEX> rounds, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> says.

            Citing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KING-TV</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> says that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspect</ENAMEX> was arrested
for a knife assault <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last November</TIMEX> and was also a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspect</ENAMEX> in the theft of
ammunition from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fort Lewis</ENAMEX>. Citing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tacoma</ENAMEX> 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News-Tribune</ENAMEX> , the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> says he pleaded guilty in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">knife</ENAMEX> case. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> notes that
also in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Army Ranger handbook</ENAMEX>. Nobody notes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fort Lewis</ENAMEX>
is an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army Ranger</ENAMEX> base.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> top-front <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>'s shoot-down of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plane</ENAMEX>, resulting in the deaths of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> aircrewmen. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> puts this
inside. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shooter</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet fighter</ENAMEX> and the bogey was an unarmed
reconnaissance <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">propeller plane</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> claim the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> was on a mission in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> airspace. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistanis</ENAMEX> claim that it was on a routine training flight
in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> airspace. The coverage stresses that this episode is bound to
ratchet up friction between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, who've already had a ground war
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this summer</TIMEX>.

            The papers report that according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Education</ENAMEX>, expulsions
for bringing a gun to school dropped by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a third</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997-98</TIMEX> compared to
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year before</TIMEX> that. In the coverage, this result is treated as confirmation
that despite sensational campus shootings, in fact the risk of school violence
is on the decline. But there is hardly any discussion of the idea that it may
just mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> are getting better at not getting caught packing. For
instance, this possibility is not even mentioned in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> piece until
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> paragraph of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-paragraph story.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of black lawyers
has complained about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Rehnquist</ENAMEX>'s singing of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dixie</ENAMEX>" at a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">judicial</ENAMEX> conference, something he's done more than once. The story was reported
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> , which added an observation based on its own
reporting--that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his 28 years</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rehnquist</ENAMEX> has never hired a black
law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX>.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> front-page feature describes the
rise of foreign hand-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> importing to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> (a topic done well
earlier in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> ) via a look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> company
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Taurus</ENAMEX>. One quote from a company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> speaks volumes. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point, he
says, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> tried to branch out from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motorcycle helmets</ENAMEX>, but was
soon hit with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100,000</NUMEX> legal judgment paid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who
died in an accident while wearing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Taurus</ENAMEX> model. "Product-liability law for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">helmets</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>," he says, "is just crazy."

            In his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> column, also appearing at the top of the LAT op-ed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">page</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Will</ENAMEX> takes out after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>. Will picks over the interview
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> gave to Talk , seeing it as suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> "has a seriousness
deficit." In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX>'s mind, most seriously non-serious seems to be that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> used
the f-word on the record with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> report that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> is coming close to
resuming its former formal relationship with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tailhook Association</ENAMEX>. By way
of reassuring that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfit</ENAMEX> has really changed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tailhook</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> tells
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> , "We've had color coordination seminars for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX>. ...
We're really trying to improve our image a bit."
