            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">25th</NUMEX> anniversary of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX>'s resignation
speech. (To watch <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> saying, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Therefore</ENAMEX>, I shall resign the presidency
effective at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>," click here. You can hear it
over and over by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clicking</ENAMEX> repeatedly.) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> decided to celebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>
Resignation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day</TIMEX> by phoning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Mark Felt</ENAMEX>, the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nora Ephron</ENAMEX> and various other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> believe to have been Deep
Throat. Chatterbox, strongly influenced by a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Mann</ENAMEX> piece in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Monthly</ENAMEX> (which is finally online; click here to read it) has himself been fairly pro-Felt lately, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subscribes to Mann</ENAMEX>'s thesis that if it wasn't Felt, it was someone else at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>. (See "
Deep <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Throat: The Game Is Afoot";</ENAMEX> "
Another Bulletin From the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep Throat Desk";</ENAMEX> "
Deep <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Throat Revealed</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">One Last Time</ENAMEX>)"; and "
Deep <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Throat Revealed</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Again</ENAMEX>).")

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier today</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> first attempted to phone Felt (now an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">octogenarian</ENAMEX> living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan</ENAMEX>), he got an answering
machine. "If you'd like to leave a message for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nick</ENAMEX>, or Deep
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Throat</ENAMEX>," it said, "you may do so after the beep." Naturally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> got a
little excited when he heard this. But when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> phoned back a little
later, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Felt</ENAMEX> said it was a gag message that she had put on her phone last
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> after having a bottle of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> with some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, and that this morning
she'd thought better of it and taken it off. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan</ENAMEX> said she really has no idea
whether her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep Throat</ENAMEX>, but that he's told her he isn't. "He hasn't
revealed it to anybody if it's true," she said. Hmm, Chatterbox
thought . A non-denial denial from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>.
            

            Then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Felt</ENAMEX> came on the line. Chatterbox schmoozed Felt a bit. Does he
get asked a lot by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> whether he's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep Throat</ENAMEX>?

            Yes. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of times so far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>.

            Are you <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep Throat</ENAMEX>?

            
               
                  The answer to that is yes and no. I'm the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that they're
talking about. [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> was initially tantalized by this, but quickly
realized Felt meant "I'm the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Felt</ENAMEX> who worked at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>."] I
was involved very deeply in all that ... went on. But I'm not guilty of
disclosure, leaking it to the press, or anything like that.
               
            

            Did Felt arrange to leak to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward</ENAMEX> through an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intermediary</ENAMEX>? "No." Does
Felt agree with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX> that the leaker was someone from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>? Felt hasn't read
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX> piece, "but I don't think so. It's just not logical ... The nature of
the information that the paper was printing would have to have come from more
than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>."

            Chatterbox, trying not to plead, asked Felt if there were any other reason,
aside from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Felt</ENAMEX>'s actually not being <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep Throat</ENAMEX> , that might impel him
to deny he was <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep Throat</ENAMEX>.

            No, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felt</ENAMEX> said. There wasn't.

            The conversation seemed to be winding down. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> asked Felt whether it
was annoying to be asked over and over again by various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> whether he was
Deep Throat. "It gets to be very provoking," he said. Does he find it
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">irritating ?</ENAMEX> "Yes."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> switched to the general topic of tension between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> at the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Edgar Hoover</ENAMEX>'s death, which occurred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</TIMEX>
before the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> break-in (and, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>, is why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> helped
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward nail Nixon</ENAMEX>). "I don't think there was any serious tension," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felt</ENAMEX> said.
Did he want the top job? "I certainly wouldn't have objected" to getting the
No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> position, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felt</ENAMEX> said. Was he disappointed when he didn't get it? "I
can't say that I was." Didn't the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> interfere with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>
investigation of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX>? "I don't have any recollection of any specifics
like that," he said--perhaps displaying an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s poor memory (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> interference is now a matter of public record), or perhaps displaying a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Smiley</ENAMEX>-like implacability. (Felt is, after all, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the
G<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-man elite</ENAMEX>.)

            Well, what about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s assertions on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> tapes that Felt was
leaking? What about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Semitic</ENAMEX> comments about Felt? Felt said he
wasn't aware of either. Chatterbox read Felt the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.R. Haldeman</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of staff</ENAMEX>, discussed their belief that Felt was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">leaking</ENAMEX>, and in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> said, regarding Felt's high position at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX>, put a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX> in there?" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> 
here, and scroll down to the boldface type, to read it.) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> asked
Felt whether he'd like to comment.

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No.</ENAMEX>" Felt indicated he was starting to lose his patience with
Chatterbox:

            
               
                  In talking with you and in talking with various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on the
press and so forth, it's really very annoying.
               
            

            Let's just say you were <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep Throat</ENAMEX>. Would that really be so
terrible?

            
               
                  It would be terrible. This would completely undermine the
reputation that you might have as a loyal, logical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>. It just
wouldn't fit at all.
               
            

            But a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep Throat</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> for getting the truth out
about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX>.

            
               
                  That's not my view at all. It would be contrary to my
responsibility as a loyal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> to leak
information.
               
            

            In other words, there is a potential reason, other than not
being <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep Throat</ENAMEX>, that might impel Felt to say he wasn't Deep
Throat: the perceived dishonor such a revelation might bring Felt as a "loyal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>."

            
               A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postscript</ENAMEX> : On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 1, 1980</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX>, "after avoiding
testifying in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtrooms</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last six years</TIMEX> [writes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Anson</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Exile: The Unquiet Oblivion</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard M. Nixon</ENAMEX> ] was on the
stand in a criminal case." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Mark Felt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edward S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller</ENAMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>, accused of conspiring
to violate the civil rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Weather Underground</ENAMEX> when they
authorized warrantless break-ins of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weatherfolk</ENAMEX> were
suspected of planting bombs in public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972 and 1973</TIMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> thought Felt was <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep Throat</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> was extremely eager to testify
on Felt and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX>'s behalf, even though he hadn't been subpoenaed. Having
successfully and rather strenuously dodged prosecution himself, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> had
volunteered to walk into a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtroom</ENAMEX> and testify to help someone he
believed had triggered his own downfall. Felt and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> had turned
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> down because they'd worried that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s reputation would only hurt Felt
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> with the largely black <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">prosecution</ENAMEX>, however, "had been
delighted to have him," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anson</ENAMEX> writes. So <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> appeared as a prosecution
witness. While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> took the oath, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Panthers</ENAMEX> and former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antiwar activists</ENAMEX>
shouted, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Thief</ENAMEX>!" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Liar</ENAMEX>!" called him a "war criminal," and were expelled by
federal marshals from the courtroom. (This according to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> volume of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Ambrose</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> biography, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ruin and Recovery</ENAMEX> .)

            On the stand, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> said that he thought the warrantless break-ins were
perfectly legal. (Although he wasn't asked under oath whether he'd known of or
approved them, he'd said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> that he hadn't.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> said,
had power to authorize such break-ins, and so did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, which was an arm of
the executive branch. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> said there had been "hard evidence" linking the
Weather Underground to foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> said he himself had approved
similar break-ins under the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> Plan," which he said was also legal.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> gave an impromptu lecture about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s heavy burden during
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wartime</ENAMEX>. "I hope that neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>, if he should
be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, has to do what I had to do, what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franklin Roosevelt</ENAMEX> had to do,
[here the judge interrupted and told the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> to ask his next question,
but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> went on] what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Truman</ENAMEX> had to do, that is, write letters to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> have been killed in war." Possibly in part because of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX>'s distaste for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nixon, Felt</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> were found guilty and sentenced to
pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5,000 and $3,500</NUMEX>, respectively. After <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX>, who was elected
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days later</TIMEX>, assumed the presidency, he pardoned the two
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.

            It is almost too irresistible to wonder: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Did Nixon</ENAMEX> serve up his sympathetic
testimony because he knew it would alienate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> and give <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep</ENAMEX>
Throat what he, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>, deemed his just deserts? We know that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> was a
revenge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buff</ENAMEX> who was capable of extraordinarily <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Machiavellian</ENAMEX> behavior. We also
know that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> sincerely believed that warrantless break-ins of the sort that
Felt and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> (and, under different circumstances, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> himself) had
authorized were a necessary line of defense against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troublemakers</ENAMEX>
(many of whom did indeed prove to be violent).

            Which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> testified at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Felt</ENAMEX>'s trial--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> wanting to give <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep Throat</ENAMEX>
a little payback or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> who wanted to stand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Punks</ENAMEX>?
Perhaps both.
