promised helpful transfers if they told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> what they wanted to hear
and threatened with retaliation if they didn't. The announcement was organized
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAACP</ENAMEX>, which suspects racism in the investigation because all the

               Political fallout from the scandal: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> expanded its
investigation to include "improper" as well as illegal conduct in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>
elections. This brings soft money and other much-criticized practices under
scrutiny. It is seen as a rebuke to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majority Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX> and a
victory for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Thompson</ENAMEX> (who will chair the investigation),
and campaign reform. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s job rating fell from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 to 55</NUMEX> points in a

of trying to destroy the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> peace process. In a letter released to the

violence and had exhausted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein</ENAMEX>'s good will. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein</ENAMEX> is regarded as

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">newsman Pierre Salinger</ENAMEX> is about to publish a massive report in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>
Match claiming that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Navy</ENAMEX> missile blew up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. The key

a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> radar tape supposedly shows a fast projectile on a collision

used in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> seats; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) seized the radar tape, ostensibly to check it out.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocate</ENAMEX> whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX> promoted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just last week</TIMEX>, can now put <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> in key jobs
and restart economic reforms. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> declared that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX> is back in the saddle and is launching a much-needed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">second</TIMEX> wave of

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tribune</ENAMEX> warned that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chubais</ENAMEX> will

indicated the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> were angry because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> was conducting economic
espionage against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> now say that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> was
gathering intelligence on another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>--most likely <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>--and that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> ordered the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomat</ENAMEX> out because they're tired of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
using their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> as a spy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nest</ENAMEX> and keeping them in the dark about it.

these documents are different from those previously cited by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>

               Morning
