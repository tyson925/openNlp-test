<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.m. Surgeons</ENAMEX> put him under local anesthesia while they reattached the tendon

asked their forgiveness. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> were moved, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX> concluded that

female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> pressured them to falsely
accuse their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superiors</ENAMEX> of rape. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> say they had sex with
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructors</ENAMEX>, but that it was consensual. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> claim they were
promised helpful transfers if they told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> what they wanted to hear
and threatened with retaliation if they didn't. The announcement was organized
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAACP</ENAMEX>, which suspects racism in the investigation because all the
accused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> are black, and most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accusers</ENAMEX>, white. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3/12</NUMEX>)
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>
told the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> it would expel an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> . Initial reports
indicated the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> were angry because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> was conducting economic
espionage against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> now say that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> was
gathering intelligence on another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>--most likely <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>--and that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> ordered the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomat</ENAMEX> out because they're tired of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
using their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> as a spy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nest</ENAMEX> and keeping them in the dark about it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> are asking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> to let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> stay. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3/12</NUMEX>)

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX> ordered a shake-up of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabinet</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX> pledged to keep <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viktor Chernomyrdin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Deputy Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anatoly</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chubais</ENAMEX>. The betting is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chubais</ENAMEX>, a free-market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocate</ENAMEX> whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX>
promoted just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>, can now put <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> in key jobs and restart economic
reforms. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> declared that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX> is back in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">saddle</ENAMEX> and is launching a much-needed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">second</TIMEX> wave of economic reform. But the
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Chicago</TIMEX> 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tribune</ENAMEX> warned that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chubais</ENAMEX> will fail, because he is a
lousy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> and everyone in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> hates him. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3/12</NUMEX>)
