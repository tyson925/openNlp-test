<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> have recommended indictments against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin</ENAMEX>

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> , his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice minister</ENAMEX>, and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of staff</ENAMEX>. The charges
concern an alleged deal to appoint an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> who would go soft on a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nominee</ENAMEX> subsequently quit). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Party</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> have
scrapped the idea of joining a coalition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX>, since they
now think they can dump him outright. As with the controversial relationship
between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX>, the decision whether to indict <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX>
now falls to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX>. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4/16</NUMEX>)
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco</ENAMEX> are discussing a possible <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300 billion</NUMEX> settlement of
all cigarette liability suits against them, according to the Wall Street
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> . They would also accept <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> supervision and restrictions on their
advertising in exchange for an act of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> that would require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> to
seek compensation from a general tobacco-industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX> rather than from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deputy White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Counsel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Lindsey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majority Leader</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX> have been briefed on the secret talks. Among the possible hitches:
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> might amend the bill in ways unacceptable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> might reject the bill if it provides too much legal immunity and
too little money to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) a congressional ban on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> lawsuits
might be unconstitutional. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4/16</NUMEX>)
            

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> are turning up the heat on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX> for
failing to appoint an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> to investigate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democratic</ENAMEX>
fund-raising scandal. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speaker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX> compared <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">henchman John Mitchell</ENAMEX>, and threatened to summon her before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and
investigate whether she was involved. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minority Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Daschle</ENAMEX>,
D-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S.D.</ENAMEX>, replied that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX>, "the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guru</ENAMEX> of ethics," had neither the right nor
the credibility to intimidate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX>. The press contrasted
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX>'s invective with the more careful and substantive criticisms leveled
at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Reno</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Judiciary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orrin Hatch</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> joined in the criticism of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Reno</ENAMEX>, while the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Tribune</ENAMEX> came to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defense</ENAMEX>.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> struck down a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> law requiring drug tests for political
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> . The court ruled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8-to-1</ENAMEX> that the urine tests were an
unreasonable search under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fourth Amendment</ENAMEX> because: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) there's no evidence
of a drug problem among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) the law was designed to be
symbolic rather than effective (e.g., it allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> to pick <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> they
will be tested). The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fourth Amendment</ENAMEX> spin is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, having upheld a
series of drug-testing laws (for railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crews</ENAMEX>, customs-service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, and
student <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX>), finally encountered one too preposterous to tolerate. The
ideological spin is that the principled left and principled right (including
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justices</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scalia</ENAMEX>) defeated the unprincipled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice</ENAMEX>

            Major
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">League Baseball</ENAMEX> retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie Robinson</ENAMEX> 's number. To commemorate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX>'s shattering of the color barrier in sports <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years ago</TIMEX>, no player
will ever again be assigned the number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baseball</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bud Selig</ENAMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robinson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX> at a ceremony honoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX>
during a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mets-Dodgers</ENAMEX> game at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shea Stadium</ENAMEX>. Sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> boasted that
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> was once again crystallizing the story of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> progress. Killjoys
pointed out that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> own none of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> failed
to sell out, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> was overwhelmingly white (as is usual at baseball
games), and that nearly everyone left the game after the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 th</NUMEX> inning
ceremony. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Vecsey</ENAMEX> suggested that latter-day
black sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiger Woods</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jordan</ENAMEX> have insulted
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX>'s legacy of sacrifice by devoting themselves to self-promotion and
corporate marketing. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4/16</NUMEX>)
            

            The
Dow Jones industrial average bounced back strongly after falling nearly
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> below its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> peak <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>. The drop had wiped out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>'s
gains and persuaded some market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> to declare the slide a correction.
Healthy corporate earnings reports and near-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> inflation in the consumer
sector turned stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> exuberant. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irrationally</ENAMEX> so? asked the Wall
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Street Journal</ENAMEX> . Probably not, said most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>, while agreeing that the
market was likely to keep lurching in response to changes in economic
indicators. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4/16</NUMEX>)
            

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> defeated a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> resolution criticizing its human-rights abuses.
Under threats from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> abstained. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France</ENAMEX>
refused to co-sponsor the resolution (human-rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> blamed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>'s
eagerness to conclude an airplane deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>). Nevertheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX> said she would attend the ceremonies in

            An
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is selling life insurance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> .
This is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> such insurance offer since the onset of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, and is viewed
as tentative commercial confirmation that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> is now, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s words,
"a treatable chronic illness rather than a terminal disease" for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> hailed it as proof of the success of new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> makes money on the policy, other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> are expected to
follow. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4/16</NUMEX>)
            

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiger Woods</ENAMEX> 
               won the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Masters golf</ENAMEX> tournament and was anointed a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transcendent Sports Phenomenon</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woods</ENAMEX> became the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> black or Asian-American
to win a major golf tournament, and broke the course records for best score (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
under par), biggest margin of victory (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> strokes), and youngest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victor</ENAMEX> (he is
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pundits</ENAMEX> declared it a triumph of youth and racial progress, comparing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woods to Jackie Robinson</ENAMEX> (whose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 th</NUMEX> anniversary of breaking the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> barrier is being celebrated simultaneously), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Ashe</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Elder</ENAMEX>
(who became the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> black golfer to play in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Masters</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>, the same
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woods</ENAMEX> was born). The game's current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> declared <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woods</ENAMEX> the best player
in the world and possibly in history. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Optimists</ENAMEX> predicted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woods</ENAMEX> will make
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf hip</ENAMEX> and popular, especially among nonwhite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pessimists</ENAMEX> grumbled that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woods</ENAMEX> is so superior he'll make tournaments boring, and that his corporate
marketing machine (whose hour-long biography of him was aired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> during the
tournament) is tarnishing his divinity. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4/14</NUMEX>)
            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>
is being fingered in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases of terrorism. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Washington Post</ENAMEX>
reported that a top <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> has been linked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> suspected in

that if the evidence holds up, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> should consider a military
strike against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> implicated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
recent assassinations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranians</ENAMEX> marched on
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tehran</ENAMEX> to protest the ruling. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX> trying to storm the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embassy</ENAMEX> were thwarted by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>. The betting is that neither side will
let the crisis escalate, because their trade relationship is too cozy.

            A
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> struck down the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Line-Item Veto</ENAMEX> 
               Act , saying it gives
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> legislative powers constitutionally reserved to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. The
ruling is seen as a victory for constitutional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purists</ENAMEX> and a political blow to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, who had hoped to use the threat (if not the reality) of a

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX> is back . On the heels of his widely acclaimed trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> has delivered high-profile speeches bashing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasser</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX>, taxes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, and government-funded art. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Conservatives</ENAMEX> are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heartened</ENAMEX>, though a few winced at his boast that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> ideas are carrying

Descending.") The contrary theory is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX> is flaming out in a
final, futile attempt to regain his authority in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>. The Wall Street
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> editorial page urges him to crown his comeback by announcing that
he will pay off his <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300,000</NUMEX> ethics penalty using campaign funds and other
donations instead of his own money--exactly the step that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> think

            New

life could exist in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europa</ENAMEX>'s ocean arises from the recent discovery that
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX> are thriving in an even less hospitable environment: volcanic vents on

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> couldn't have been exposed to nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>, and (after that assurance
