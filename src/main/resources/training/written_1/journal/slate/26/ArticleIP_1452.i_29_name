talks . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had demanded tax cuts for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working poor</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>
had demanded tax cuts for the upper-middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>. They compromised by giving
tax cuts to everyone. Meanwhile, they threw out proposed premium hikes for
wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>. The political consensus is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> won all the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">battles</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> won the war (for a budget package with tax cuts). The
fiscal consensus is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> have once again managed to
take credit for a windfall not of their making (since the economy is generating
enough revenue to balance the budget without any deal) and squander the
windfall on politically calculated handouts. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7/28</NUMEX>)
            

            The
scandal over deaf <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> slaves widened. First, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> deaf
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> in "virtual slavery" in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Queens</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ); then similar
rackets were busted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> were smuggled
into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, miserably housed, and forced to peddle <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 trinkets</NUMEX> (in
places like the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX>) to make money for their "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pimps</ENAMEX>." The media bemoaned the
vulnerability of illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> (trapped by their fear that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsiders</ENAMEX> will
discover they're illegal) and congratulated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayor Rudy Giuliani</ENAMEX> for rescuing
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> slaves. Eventually, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> conceded that the conditions
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, which these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> had fled and to which none so far want to
return, were just as bad. "In a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> and marginalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,
the deaf are almost invisible," grieved the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> . (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7/28</NUMEX>)
            

            Case
closed: Alleged "spree killer" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Cunanan</ENAMEX> , who was being hunted by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> for the murder of fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gianni Versace</ENAMEX> and others, killed
himself. The premature anticlimax disappointed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, but they continued to
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> the story anyway. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Autumn Jackson</ENAMEX> was convicted of trying to extort <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$40</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Cosby</ENAMEX> . Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> is contemplating a paternity suit,
which might oblige <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cosby</ENAMEX> to take a blood test. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> cleared <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carroll</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Connor</ENAMEX> of slander for calling his deceased <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> "a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in murder." The pusher portrayed the verdict as a victory for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> portrayed it as a defeat for scum. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reputed Mafia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent "Chin</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gigante</ENAMEX> reported to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> after being convicted of
racketeering and conspiracy to murder. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7/28</NUMEX>)
            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weld</ENAMEX> resigned as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> to campaign for the job of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. He has been nominated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, but Sen.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Helms</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.C.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</ENAMEX>,
has vowed to quash the nomination on the grounds that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weld</ENAMEX> is soft on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> agree that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helms</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opposition</ENAMEX> guaranteed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weld</ENAMEX> had almost no
chance of getting the job to begin with; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weld</ENAMEX>'s caustic remarks about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helms</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last couple of weeks</TIMEX> have further doomed his chances; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weld</ENAMEX>'s
resignation won't help him. The subtle theory is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weld</ENAMEX> knows he will lose
but is positioning himself for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> presidential run in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. The crude theory
is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weld</ENAMEX> just loves a good fight, particularly with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helms</ENAMEX>.

            Update
on the campaign-finance hearings : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny Chung</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times that the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50,000</NUMEX> check he handed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX>'s chief of staff
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> had been solicited by Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, explicitly to
help pay for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> parties billed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung</ENAMEX> explained, "I see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> is like a subway: You have
to put in coins to open the gates." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majority Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX> called
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stonewall Reno</ENAMEX>" for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) opposing immunity for
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nuns</ENAMEX> whose testimony might implicate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
refusing to appoint an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX>. Former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haley Barbour</ENAMEX>
testified in defense of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Policy Forum</ENAMEX>, through which a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> provided collateral for a loan that ended up helping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>
congressional races. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pundits</ENAMEX> vouched that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbour</ENAMEX> was a swell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddy</ENAMEX> of theirs
and that he had acquitted himself brilliantly. Reviews of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> so far:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thompson</ENAMEX>--fair and brave; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX>--petty and partisan; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lieberman</ENAMEX>--honest and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constructive; Torricelli</ENAMEX>--servile and sanctimonious. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>'s take, see

            DNA
evidence shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Neanderthals</ENAMEX> were not our ancestors. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>
argued that the research supports <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> politically important theories: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) Humans
have had so little time to diverge genetically that the differences between
human "races" are trivial, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) our common ancestors came from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cro-Magnons</ENAMEX>) and drove the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Neanderthals</ENAMEX>) to extinction. Why didn't
we interbreed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Neanderthals</ENAMEX> when they were still around? Because they
were ugly, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> . (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7/28</NUMEX>)
            

            Miscellany: An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> says he saw <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pol Pot</ENAMEX> tried for genocide and sentenced to life
imprisonment by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribunal</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 25</TIMEX>. Length of the trial: <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> speculated that this is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX>'s bid for legitimacy in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambodia</ENAMEX>'s latest factional power struggle. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retired Supreme Court Justice</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Brennan</ENAMEX> died. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Liberals</ENAMEX> called him the greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jurisprudence</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Conservatives</ENAMEX> noted their disagreements with him but remembered
him as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of principle and a truly nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Peruvian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alberto</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fujimori</ENAMEX> is in deep trouble: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citizens</ENAMEX> are angry over his alleged illegal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wiretapping</ENAMEX> and suppression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>, and newly discovered documents
indicate that he may have been born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX>, which would make
him ineligible for his job. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> discharged a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-year</TIMEX> decorated
veteran <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> before he would have been eligible for retirement
benefits, because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> discovered evidence of his homosexuality after
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arsonist</ENAMEX> torched his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan Ullrich</ENAMEX> became the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cyclist</ENAMEX> to
