He also urged privately funded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> not to clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. A bill was
filed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> to ban human cloning outright. Contrary to the traditional
objection to birth control--that it permits sex without reproduction--critics
of cloning are increasingly objecting that it permits reproduction without sex.

<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> fund-raising scandal is closing in on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> reported that during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">campaign</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>
made private phone calls (some from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>) soliciting donations. The
report prompted further calls for an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX>, on the grounds that a
high government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>) had violated the law by making political calls
from a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Editorialists</ENAMEX> derided <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s response that the law
doesn't apply to him. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> suggested that their end (getting
re-elected and thereby helping the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>) justified their means (using
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> to raise money). <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> also released records showing that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Quayle</ENAMEX> had used his official <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> for a reception for
high-dollar <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pundits</ENAMEX> are bewailing the shattering of

            New

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster Hubbell</ENAMEX> was paid far more money in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the months</TIMEX> after his
resignation than had been previously thought, much of it from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>, and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> endorsed a project in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> that was
financially important to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riady</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> just after a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riady</ENAMEX>-controlled company
put <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbell</ENAMEX> on its payroll. Whitewater <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Independent Counsel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX> has
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subpoenaed White House</ENAMEX> records, evidently to find out whether the
Riady-controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lippo Group</ENAMEX> paid hush money to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbell</ENAMEX> to prevent him from
cooperating with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Whitewater</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Rodham Clinton</ENAMEX>'s chief of

            Update
on the investigation: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> decided that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> fund-raising
probe will cover congressional as well as presidential campaigns, but will
concern itself with only "illegal activities," not soft money. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) Attorney
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX> concluded that laws prohibiting political fund
raising in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> apply only to direct campaign contributions,
not to soft money. This lets <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Rodham Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of staff</ENAMEX> off the hook, which, in turn, reduces the chances <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX> will
authorize an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX> announced
an investigation of possible efforts by foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> to influence

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> welcomed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasser Arafat</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and

Administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> was deliberately <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) "rolling
out the carpet" to enhance <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX>'s prestige and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) sending <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> a warning
not to screw up the peace process by provoking further conflict. News accounts
agree that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> has finally shed his image as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist</ENAMEX> and is now being
honored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> not only as a virtual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of state but as the

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morning News</ENAMEX> reported that "confidential defense reports" show
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy McVeigh</ENAMEX> confessed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> bombing. The document in
question appears to consist of notes taken by a defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> during an
interview with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McVeigh</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McVeigh</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> indicated that his team
had faked the putative confession in order to persuade a witness to talk to
them, and an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> has now confirmed that the defense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>'s
private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eye</ENAMEX> told him of the fake confession <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX>. The executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of

granting citizenship to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX>--if not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX>--of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who should have
been rejected because of past felony convictions. Again, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> is
at the center of the controversy. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> indicate that the pressure came from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and was driven in
