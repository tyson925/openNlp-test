hearings on the campaign-finance scandal opened. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> Sen.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Thompson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tenn.</ENAMEX>, announced that he had evidence of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> plot to
infiltrate the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, but couldn't say more because the evidence is top
secret. Ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Glenn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>, indirectly accused <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCarthyism</ENAMEX> and upstaged him by announcing an offer from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Huang</ENAMEX> to testify
in exchange for partial immunity. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> worried that an immunity grant
might let <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> off the hook, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ã  la Ollie North</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Hours</TIMEX> later, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>
(including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Burton</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> investigating
the scandal) toasted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX> at a gala in his honor. The early line is that the
hearings aren't catching fire. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>'s take, see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Weisberg</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dispatch</ENAMEX>." (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7/9</NUMEX>)
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Doctors</ENAMEX>
reported that fenfluramine and phentermine, a popular diet pill
combination, may cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">severe heart-valve disease</ENAMEX> . The story is all over
front pages and the TV news because the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX> are prescribed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 20 million</NUMEX>
times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> is sending warnings to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>. The news cycle on drug scares has become so fast that the backlash
(accusing the new report of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-hyping the heart-disease link and ignoring the
benefits of reduced obesity) is already underway. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7/9</NUMEX>)
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>
landed a robot on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> and began exploring the surface. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> are

of ancient flood <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (which might now be frozen at the poles or beneath the

the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX>. The victors began looting, and hunting down
the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>'s political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX>, one of whom has already been executed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> foresee <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possible outcomes: brutal tyranny (the optimistic
scenario) or bloody civil war. This follows <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambodia</ENAMEX>'s history of: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) massive
genocide; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) a decade-long civil war; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> in foreign aid

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> revoked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Tyson</ENAMEX>'s license to fight and fined him <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3</NUMEX>
million for biting off part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evander Holyfield</ENAMEX>'s ear. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyson</ENAMEX> can apply for
reinstatement in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Optimists</ENAMEX> called the penalty stiff and predicted that
it would restore some standard of decency to the sport. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pessimists</ENAMEX> pointed out
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyson</ENAMEX> gets to keep <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$27 million</NUMEX> he earned from the fight and can take his

<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68 years</TIMEX>. It was the longest-reigning political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> in the

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernesto Zedillo</ENAMEX> executed one of history's most impressive

of freedom and democracy he has fostered. Now that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> has lost its grip,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> foresee a wave of opportunistic defections by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>, as happened

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX>-set lead in the finals for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time but managed (unlike last
