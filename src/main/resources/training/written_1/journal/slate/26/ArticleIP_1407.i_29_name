<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mobutu Sese Seko</ENAMEX> returned home from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> in a last-ditch

recommendation that the benefits to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">40s</NUMEX> didn't necessarily

reverse that recommendation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>. The prevailing wisdom now is that the

            The

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">295-136</ENAMEX>--better than a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> majority--which means that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> of the

Despite all the hoopla over a pro-choice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocate</ENAMEX>'s confession that he had lied
about the circumstances under which the procedure is generally used, only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> switched their votes from "no" to "yes." (See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abortion Apostate</ENAMEX>" on

            The
tobacco industry suffered a potentially catastrophic defection. The
smallest of the major tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liggett Group</ENAMEX>, agreed to a
settlement with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys general</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> who had sued to recoup money
spent on health care for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>. The media focused on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liggett</ENAMEX>'s admissions of
the obvious--that cigarettes are addictive and cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and heart
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX>--and its agreement to pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> a quarter of its (relatively
small) pretax profits for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 25 years</TIMEX>. The more important concessions,
however, were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liggett</ENAMEX>'s admission that the industry had consciously marketed
tobacco to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minors</ENAMEX> (which will increase congressional support for stiff

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carolina</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>--of documents from strategy meetings among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
biggest tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, which industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> believe will prove a
conspiracy of deceit. Also, the tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> who told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> they
didn't consider nicotine addictive might now be prosecuted for fraud and
perjury. As for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liggett</ENAMEX>'s motive, industry and financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> speculated
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liggett</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> hoped to make the marginally profitable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> a more
