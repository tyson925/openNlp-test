<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deranged</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> blame <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein</ENAMEX> for inciting the attack by
releasing a vitriolic letter that accused <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> of provoking <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> violence. Conversely, some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX>
blame <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> for escalating tensions in the region by expanding <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> housing
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Jerusalem</ENAMEX> and failing to relinquish enough of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Bank</ENAMEX>. The
massacre prompted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasser Arafat</ENAMEX> to speak to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> after

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">looting</ENAMEX>, and roving bands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">robbers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inmates</ENAMEX> are escaping from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jails</ENAMEX>, and the

also matches the description provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who allegedly saw the

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> say the price increase proves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s telecommunications bill
failed to keep cable rates down as promised, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) competition from

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> are expected to follow suit if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI</ENAMEX> gets away with the rate increase.

            The
anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-cloning</ENAMEX> backlash is underway. At a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> hearing, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> worried that a ban on human-cloning research might prevent lifesaving
medical breakthroughs, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ethicists</ENAMEX> said there is no need to
legislate hastily, since it will take a while to refine the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>-cloning
technique to work in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. This comes after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> banned federal
funding of human-cloning research and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> filed bills to ban human
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cloning</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunday Times of London</ENAMEX> reported that a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Belgian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>
had cloned a human, but the report was soon debunked when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>
explained that he had merely fertilized an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> in vitro and then caused it to
split, producing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>. Meanwhile, an elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milwaukee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> are soliciting

            The

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">newsman Pierre Salinger</ENAMEX> published a massive report in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> 
               Match
claiming that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Navy</ENAMEX> missile blew up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. The key evidence cited in
the report: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>'s seats showing "chemical elements
consistent with solid missile fuel" and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) a government radar tape showing a
fast projectile on a collision course with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> tests show the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> is from standard <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glue</ENAMEX> used in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> seats.
They also seized the radar tape, examined it, and said it shows no missile. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> 
               Post groaned that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> mystery "has become the
aviation equivalent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> assassination"--i.e., no amount of disproof
satisfies the conspiracy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorists</ENAMEX>. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3/14</NUMEX>)
            

            

               Update on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> fund-raising scandal : <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> denied him advance warning about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
influence-buying efforts by telling his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> to keep the information secret.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> then issued a statement contradicting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pundits oohed</ENAMEX> and aahed
over the quarrel. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX> everyone insisted it was just a

unable to reach him by phone, so she asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> to tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>,
which led to the above fiasco. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> warned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> had targeted them for illegal campaign donations through

its payroll. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lanny Davis</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> may have

confessed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> bombing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> claims its article is
based on documents "prepared under the direction" of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McVeigh</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, but that
these documents are different from those previously cited by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>

               Morning 
               News . According to the article, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McVeigh</ENAMEX> said he alone
drove the truck <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> to the site--but he flunked polygraph tests, and his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> were skeptical. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> reports that "details in the

promised helpful transfers if they told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> what they wanted to hear
and threatened with retaliation if they didn't. The announcement was organized
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAACP</ENAMEX>, which suspects racism in the investigation because all the

victory for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Thompson</ENAMEX> (who will chair the investigation),
