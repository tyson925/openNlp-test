in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the wee hours of the morning</TIMEX> to watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">funeral</ENAMEX> on television. The big
story was her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>'s slap at the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> was "someone with a
natural nobility who was classless and who ... needed no royal title to
continue to generate her particular brand of magic." For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, the royals were
scorned as stuffy brutes for failing to display grief in public. When they
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">relented</ENAMEX> and displayed their grief, they were likened to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> (for
feeling others' pain) and scorned for pandering to public opinion. Several
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits belatedly</ENAMEX> conceded that they had covered the story obsessively
based on their false intimacy with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> and their whitewashed view of her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>. They resumed covering the story obsessively based on the public's
false intimacy with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> and its whitewashed view of her character.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mother Teresa</ENAMEX> also died. Reviews of her career were highly favorable.
Pundits paused to pay their respects before returning to the topic of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Princess</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX>. The proximity of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s deaths inspired a flurry of silly
comparisons, which in turn inspired a backlash of equally silly commentaries
pointing out their differences. Former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Zairian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mobutu Sese Seko</ENAMEX>
died, too. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mobutu</ENAMEX> ended up being only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-most important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to
die during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX>, coverage of his demise was largely buried.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> is on the hot seat in the campaign-finance investigation .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> reported that some of the money <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> raised in phone
calls from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> went to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> campaign ("hard" money)
instead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Committee</ENAMEX> ("soft" money). This removes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX>'s rationale for not appointing an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX>.
The betting now is that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> will be named, and will hound <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
Scandal questions upstaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s feel-good visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>, giving
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> hope that he may get a real fight in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> primaries. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sympathizers</ENAMEX> are shifting from defending his innocence to blaming <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> for
corrupting him. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9/8</NUMEX>)
            

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paula Jones</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> reportedly are withdrawing from her
sexual-harassment case against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. The issue: They want her to
accept <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$700,000</NUMEX> and a vague statement from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>--which means they'd get
paid--but she's holding out for an explicit apology. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> can't
confirm that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> authorized the settlement proposal, the dispute
between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> is being portrayed strictly as chaos within her
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">camp</ENAMEX>. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9/8</NUMEX>)
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Tennis prodigy Venus</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Williams</ENAMEX> lost in the finals of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">U.S. Open</ENAMEX>. Because she's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> and black
(her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> calls her a "ghetto Cinderella"), and because she's been hyped for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> (she got a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multimillion-dollar</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reebok</ENAMEX> contract at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>), she overshadowed
the new men's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heartthrob</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Rafter</ENAMEX>--and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">champion Martina Hingis</ENAMEX>, who is a year younger than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> and creamed her in
the finals. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commentators</ENAMEX> were set to anoint <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> the next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiger Woods</ENAMEX>, but
her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> screwed it up by calling her semifinal opponent a "white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX>" and
portraying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX>'s collision with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Williams</ENAMEX> during a changeover as "a
racial thing." Pressed about these remarks, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> parried, ducked, and fled
her press conference. Critics contrast her arrogance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiger Woods</ENAMEX>' good
manners. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Defenders</ENAMEX> see a double standard: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> don't blame white players
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steffi Graf</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Pierce</ENAMEX>) for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>' misbehavior, so why should
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> be blamed for her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s? (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9/8</NUMEX>)
