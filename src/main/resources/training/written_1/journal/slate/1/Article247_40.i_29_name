            In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">profiler</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marjorie Williams</ENAMEX> offers this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tasty Larry King</ENAMEX> anecdote:

            "One of the most oft told of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Larry Stories</ENAMEX> that circulate at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>
concerns his take-out order when he eats dinner at his desk, before the show.
His favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX>, from a local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cashews</ENAMEX>--without the fat-laden cashews. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> arrives, a young intern
or production <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> is charged with combing through it to remove any errant
nuts; then he or she has to swaddle the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> in paper towels and squeeze out
any excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>."

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox's</ENAMEX>, who recalls his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-year</TIMEX> tenure as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Grease</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Monkey</ENAMEX>, says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> got the story right, but underplays how loopy the
talk-show <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> is about his vittles.

            "I drained <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost two years</TIMEX> while working for the show. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">intern/</ENAMEX>production <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> must open his cranberry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX> and pour it over ice
for him, just so . He also wants the packets of hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mustard</ENAMEX> opened for
him and spread over the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX>. If he spots nuts or excess grease in his grub,
the show is ruined! During commercial breaks, he will harp about the botched
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meal</ENAMEX>, unsettling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King crew</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guest</ENAMEX> alike. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intern</ENAMEX>/production assistant
can only dive for cover."

            The retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Grease Monkey</ENAMEX> says that the only time there was absolute calm on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX> was when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> went out to dinner.
