            Something has happened to the argument over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flytrap</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. It's
become tedious. Initially the issues were legion, the ramifications seemingly
kaleidoscopic, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> unsure of their positions. There were traitors and
apostates, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clintonite Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> and conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidency-defenders</ENAMEX>,
and many who were simply confused and bemused. Now things have settled out,
along binary lines that are all too familiar. "Everyone lies about sex." "But
it was under oath ." "So what. " "It's a crime." No it isn't. Yes it is.
'Tis not. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etc.</ENAMEX>. Everyone's had this argument; everyone's been annoyed by not
winning this argument; nobody wants to have this argument again. Were somebody
to start it at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> cocktail party, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> would scurry into the
other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> as surely as if that someone had said "Let's build the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> to the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21st century</TIMEX>" or attempted to redebate the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam War</ENAMEX> ... Of course,
Washingtonians may have chosen up sides in this fashion in part because so many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> need to choose up sides in order to do their jobs, in
part because the only thing more boring than having an opinion on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flytrap</ENAMEX> is
not having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Well</ENAMEX>, I think only time will tell." "Gee, I'm so glad I
invited you ...."). Outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> never cared that
much about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flytrap</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place, opinions may be much less dug in, more
vaguely-formed and fluid. ... The catch is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> commentariat is
tempted to conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flytrap</ENAMEX> is over because it is bored with the scandal.
But in the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, the scandal may simply have yet to catch on ...
Only time will tell! ...

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mulholland Dive</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Times</ENAMEX> reports in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 11</TIMEX>
edition that a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">party official</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Mulholland</ENAMEX>, is
gathering marital dirt on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> who might vote on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s impeachment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mulholland</ENAMEX> doesn't duck the charge: "Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Judiciary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">divorced</ENAMEX>, and their divorce papers contain a lot of interesting information,
and we'll be sharing that with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>," he tells the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>
... <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fair</ENAMEX> enough. Honest blackmail! ... Well, not completely honest, since the
main charge against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> isn't marital infidelity, it's perjury and
obstruction of justice. ... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mulholland</ENAMEX> is good at his job. If I were a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> I'd worry more about him and less about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney Blumenthal</ENAMEX>. ... Even
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> once did a bit of business with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mulholland</ENAMEX>. What kind of business?
Let's just say that a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Reagan-Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> was
known to somewhat hypocritically visit a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> newsstand that featured an
extensive selection of adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> heard about this from a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend</ENAMEX>, told someone else, and eventually got a call from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mulholland</ENAMEX>, who asked
for the name of the newsstand, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> provided. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Four days</TIMEX> before the
election, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> poll showing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> in a virtual tie, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mulholland</ENAMEX> got
the story out by shouting questions at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> during a campaign
stop--accusing him of also patronizing a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sunset Boulevard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strip club</ENAMEX>. He
admitted going to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>, which he called "a cocktail place." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Witnesses</ENAMEX>
confirmed his newsstand habits. He did not win. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Boxer</ENAMEX>, who
did, owes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> a medium-sized chit. ... Given this incident, however,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mulholland</ENAMEX> would probably be the wrong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> to righteously attack <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenneth</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> for trying to learn about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX>'s semi-pornographic bookstore
purchases ...

            
               Note to starving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">freelance writers</ENAMEX>: If you've been recruited to write
op-ed opinion pieces praising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>, as part of the phony <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> "grass
roots" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> campaign revealed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> , don't
consider the rent paid just yet! Specifically, have you ever tried actually
getting a freelance writing check out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s notorious Accounts Payable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>? Expect roughly the same effort it might take to obtain payment from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> for a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">anti-ballistic missile system</ENAMEX>. ... Don't
believe it? You might want to look up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Seligman</ENAMEX>'s article in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, 1997</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly Standard</ENAMEX> on "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">How Microsoft Pays Its Bills"...</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX>'s theory: in the exciting new world of personal computing, you can
create unlimited amounts of paperwork without even the constraint of having to
buy the paper! ...<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recommendation</ENAMEX>: Demand cash up front, before you write a
word! It works for Chatterbox! ...

            
               Straight to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Video</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> (having been paid) was about to write
an exciting item about the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fall of the Pundettes</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Ingraham</ENAMEX> out at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>!
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ann Coulter</ENAMEX> out at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSNBC</ENAMEX>! We're bored with blonde <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">right-wing babes</ENAMEX>! Etc. But
now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> has learned that a) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ingraham</ENAMEX> will announce a big deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>; and b) practically all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSNBC</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX>," not just <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Coulter</ENAMEX>,
are kaput. ... Never mind. ...

            
               Why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie May Fear the Post</ENAMEX>: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>'s fair and balanced assessment
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Johnson</ENAMEX> mentioned that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae Foundation</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> cosponsor a series of free concerts at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kennedy</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> (which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> also heads). The concerts, which began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, are one
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way for Johnson</ENAMEX> to get friendly with a major journalistic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> that
might write nasty things about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> rightly points
out that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> has, in fact, written nasty things about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January, 1995</TIMEX>, before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post -Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">freebies</ENAMEX> began,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> gave prominent play to a tough <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-part series by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Vise</ENAMEX>,
entitled "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Money Machine</ENAMEX>: How <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae Wields Power</ENAMEX>." The highlight: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">To</ENAMEX>
prevent the financially-stricken <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> from trying to collect some
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300 million</NUMEX> in local taxes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> threatens to drop its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3 million</NUMEX> in
support for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX>. And the threat works! ...
