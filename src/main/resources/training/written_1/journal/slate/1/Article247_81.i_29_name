            Is Chatterbox crazy to think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney Blumenthal</ENAMEX> didn't get enough
favorable publicity after he was forced to appear before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX>'s grand
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> to tell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> whether he was saying nasty things about them? The
subpoena was, after all, just as outrageous as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commentariat</ENAMEX> said it was.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Does Pepperdine</ENAMEX> law school really want to give its deanship to someone who
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">doesn</ENAMEX>' t know the first thing about the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX>?) Yet when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenthal</ENAMEX>
finally testified <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Thursday</TIMEX>, and then denounced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> from the courthouse
steps, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David "Excitable Boy" Bloom poisoned Blumenthal</ENAMEX>'s
sound bite by characterizing it in advance as a "tirade."... The most
gratuitously anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sid</ENAMEX> coverage was the front-page sneer from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John M. Broder</ENAMEX> in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broder</ENAMEX>'s story began with this: "After a long career
as a scribbler in the shadows, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney Blumenthal</ENAMEX> got his moment in the sun
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>... ." Now, it's true that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenthal</ENAMEX> was obviously loving the exposure,
but so are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who appear in the New York
Times . That doesn't usually get them a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-graph smirk, at least when
there are important things at stake. Imagine the respectful tone the
Times would have struck if, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erskine Bowles</ENAMEX> had been hauled before
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">grand jury</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> issues would have been the same....
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broder</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> graph was bizarre: "A former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>'s
most celebrated conspiracy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorist</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenthal</ENAMEX> faced the cameras at the
peak of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Hemisphere</ENAMEX>'s last total solar eclipse of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the millennium</TIMEX>."
Chatterbox at first thought this was an adventurous metaphor for the way
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenthal</ENAMEX>'s story had been eclipsed by the news from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, or the lull in the
Flytrap scandal, or by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broder</ENAMEX>'s own attitude. But no. Turns out it was an
in-joke--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenthal</ENAMEX> is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">millennium</TIMEX> freak. You can laugh now... When is an
in-joke too in to run? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX>'s rule of thumb is that if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> doesn't
get the joke, it doesn't belong in the paper. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> gets the joke but
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> sitting next to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> doesn't, it's cutting-edge journalism....
Why don't <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sid</ENAMEX>? Not simply because when he was a political writer
he was considered pathetically in-the-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> for
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2/23</NUMEX>). It's also his standard demeanor, which features a permanent
I-know-a-secret-that-I'm-not-telling-you grin.... Contacted by telephone, the
Times ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broder</ENAMEX> denies any "personal animosity toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sid</ENAMEX>."... Yes, that's
right, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> actually picked up the phone and called somebody for a
reaction. Journalism! Don't expect it to happen again...

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CORPORATISM</ENAMEX> WATCH: "There is a significant difference between asking
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and asking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of a Web page on
the Internet for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Kalb</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shorenstein Center</ENAMEX>
on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Press</ENAMEX> and Politics at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>, tells the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> . "On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drudge</ENAMEX> side,
you're in uncharted waters." Meaning what? That <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drudge</ENAMEX> has different [fewer?]
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Amendment</ENAMEX> rights than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenthal</ENAMEX>? That <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kalb</ENAMEX> knows how to get his name in
the papers?... It's true that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney Blumenthal</ENAMEX> now being pursued by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>
is the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney Blumenthal</ENAMEX> who recently demanded that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Drudge</ENAMEX> reveal
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. There's some hypocrisy there on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenthal</ENAMEX>'s part. But
there is a difference between the two situations, and it's not the offensive
Drudge-is<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-a-peon</ENAMEX> distinction offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalb</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenthal</ENAMEX> was never in charge of
a grand jury criminal proceeding, the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> is. He is suing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drudge</ENAMEX> in civil
court for libel, the same way any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> can sue another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> for libel. If
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> had similarly sued <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenthal</ENAMEX> for libel or slander instead of calling him
before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">grand jury</ENAMEX> (where, among other things, you're not entitled to have a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> present during questioning), we'd have a different story on our hands.
But of course <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> would never do that because he's a "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> figure" and
under existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> precedents would have the same trouble proving
his case that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenthal</ENAMEX> will have in his suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drudge</ENAMEX>...
