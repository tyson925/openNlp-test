            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">I Made Paula Jones Famous</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brock</ENAMEX>, who wants everyone to know that he
deeply regrets single-handedly bringing down the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, isn't the only
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> to have reported the allegations of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troopers</ENAMEX> who
claim to have procured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> for then-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. In addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Spectator</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April, 1994</TIMEX>, printed a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">long</ENAMEX>, well-documented piece by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Wattenberg</ENAMEX> recounting the tale of Trooper
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.D. Brown</ENAMEX>, who claims to have solicited "over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a hundred</TIMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>.
Does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wattenberg</ENAMEX>, who quit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectator</ENAMEX> that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">same year</TIMEX>, still stand by
his story? "Yes, I do," he says.

            In a phone interview <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brock</ENAMEX> was not as oily as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> had
hoped he'd be. But he was quite disingenuous on the subject of whether he still
believes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troopers</ENAMEX>' essential allegations. In his well-hyped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esquire</ENAMEX>
"apology"--the most recent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-</ENAMEX>was<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-a-hatchet-man number</ENAMEX> in
which he defended his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Troopergate</ENAMEX> reporting--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brock</ENAMEX> merely says he's had
"occassional pangs of doubt" about the trooper story. Not exactly a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recantation</ENAMEX>. What <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> doesn't have occasional pangs of doubt about
controversial pieces? Pressed on this point, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brock</ENAMEX> paused, then paused some
more, then would only say, "There may well be some truth in what [the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">troopers</ENAMEX>]
say. I don't know. I'm not ruling it out. I'm not standing by it." At least
that is his position on the record. You get the sense that he doesn't want to
say anything that might annoy his new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>. ... If he thought
the gist of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troopers</ENAMEX>' story was false, of course, he could just declare
that he thought it was false. ... Asked if he still defends his earlier,
anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anita Hill</ENAMEX> sexological snooping, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brock</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unenthusiastically</ENAMEX> says "Yeah."
...

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stand-Up Backstabbing</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Begala</ENAMEX> is emerging as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loyalty</ENAMEX> in the
Flytrap scandal. Is that the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Begala</ENAMEX> who leaked nasty little tidbits
about fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Clintonians</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Woodward</ENAMEX> for use in the latter's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> book,
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Agenda</ENAMEX> ? Like the detail that in a meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begala</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Deputy</ENAMEX> Budget
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice Rivlin</ENAMEX> was eating a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken salad sandwich</ENAMEX>, which was "dripping
from her chin"? That's loyalty! ... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Begala</ENAMEX> also called his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX>,
then-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon Panetta</ENAMEX>, "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poster Boy for Economic Constipation</ENAMEX>."
... Of course, in the great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> debate between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begala</ENAMEX>'s don't
-tax-the-middle-class "populists" and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rivlin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Panetta</ENAMEX>'s Wall-Street-pleasing
budget-balancers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rivlin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Panetta</ENAMEX> have been proven right and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begala</ENAMEX> proven
wrong ...

            
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabato Scorecard</ENAMEX>: In the early stages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flytrap</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Feeding Frenzy</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sabato</ENAMEX> was all over the tube,
promoting his view that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX> of all that facts that come out in the early
stages of a scandal will always turn out to be wrong. Call it <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Sabato's Law</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> would like to pose a contrary hypothesis: in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flytrap</ENAMEX>, virtually all
the stories that get criticized as the false products of a Sabatovian "feeding
frenzy" will turn out to be essentially true. Here are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of them:

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Did Clinton</ENAMEX> give <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> a dress?

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Did Clinton</ENAMEX> seemingly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty Currie</ENAMEX> with leading questions, as
reported in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ?

            --Did steward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayani Nelvis</ENAMEX> see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX> alone in the study near
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oval Ofice</ENAMEX>, as reported in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> ?

            --Did a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> in a "compromising
situation," as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dallas Morning News</ENAMEX> initially reported? In an
"ambiguous situation," as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, watered-down version had it?

            Keep score at home! Add new stories to the list as they come out and get
knocked down with carefully worded denials by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>-affiliated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> (as
was the so-far perfectly accurate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> story on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Currie</ENAMEX>--see
Chatterbox for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2/18</NUMEX>). Remember that to win, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabato</ENAMEX> has to get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX>!
... Or maybe his own pontifications were part of that inaccurate <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX>.
(The same way all those ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> who are telling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pollsters</ENAMEX> they think
it's OK to lie may be lying to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pollsters</ENAMEX> about what they think!) ... <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Of</ENAMEX>
course, even if all the "feeding frenzy" stories turn out to be true, by the
time they are proven true the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> may already have come to the unshakable
conclusion that they're suspect, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> may be so accustomed to the
scandal that it doesn't care. This is the genius behind the "knock it down
today, forget about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> strategy. ...

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">DOX KNOX BROX CROX</ENAMEX>! <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> would love to dismiss the idea that a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s function is to be a "role model," as opposed to simply an effective
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, the evidence keeps coming in that the "role model" effect is
real. The latest? <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This week</TIMEX>'s study in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of the American Medical</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> confirming that mastectomies increased after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Reagan</ENAMEX> chose
to undergo that radical procedure rather than have a less drastic "lumpectomy."
Indeed, lumpectomies dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 percent</NUMEX>. The conclusion: "medical care can be
influenced substantially by the behavior of celebrity role models." And sexual
behavior can be influenced substantially by ...

            Which brings us to the CHATTERBOX LEXIS-NEXIS FIND OF THE DAY:
            

            "Let me say that there is a lot of talk about personal responsibility. What
we have to do is practice it. There's a lot of talk about valuing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and
work and community. What we have to do is value them."

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, remarks before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 25th anniversary</TIMEX> dinner of the
Congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Caucus</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 23, 1995</TIMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> is already feeling occasional pangs of doubt about all of the
above items! ...
