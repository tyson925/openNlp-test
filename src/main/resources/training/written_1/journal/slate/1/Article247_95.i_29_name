            Chatterbox was shocked upon reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Grove</ENAMEX>'s recent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
Post profile of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Johnson</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX> is the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mondale</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> who runs
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX>, the "government sponsored enterprise" that buys mortgages, packages
them into large blocks and resells them as "mortgage-backed securities." What
was so shocking? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> already knew <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> was one of the last great
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> rackets--a place where ordinary, competent, well-connected politicos
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> get to earn astronomical, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon Gekko</ENAMEX>-like sums (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> made an
estimated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7.2 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>) while working to preserve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> favors
that help this ostensibly private, for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX> earn <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3 billion</NUMEX> or so
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. If somebody had to win the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> jackpot, it might as well be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>, who--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> attest--is a decent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.

            No, what startled were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s other jobs: in addition to running
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX>, he is also <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kennedy Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Culture</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">box</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brookings Institution</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s leading
liberal/centrist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">think tank</ENAMEX>. Suddenly, this bland, bespectacled
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norwegian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> has emerged, in the words of ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Ickes</ENAMEX>, as
"the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the universe." OK, that may be overstatement (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ickes</ENAMEX> is also
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who calls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX>'s judicially-supervised subpoenas "Gestapo
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> state tactics"). But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s equivalent of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Eisner</ENAMEX>, a self-promoting power-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nerd</ENAMEX> who protects his insidiously
synergistic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> by buying off potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> with well-publicized good
works.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grove</ENAMEX>'s profile wasn't that nasty (after its publication, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> sent an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appreciative</ENAMEX> don't-worry-I'm-not-mad note to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> matriarch <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katharine</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX>). But the piece contained the essential anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> charge--that "he
wields his considerable clout mainly to protect and defend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX>'s
congressionally mandated business advantages." What advantages? First, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mae</ENAMEX> pays no state or local taxes, depriving the needy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">District of Columbia</ENAMEX> of
perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of millions of dollars</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, various federal laws imply
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX>'s securities are backed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. This lets
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> raise money at interest rates lower than its private competitors
must pay. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Budget Office</ENAMEX> estimates the value of these special
breaks at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>, of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a third</NUMEX> goes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>. (See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew Cooper</ENAMEX>'s 
                  Slate
               
analysis, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> appreciatively called "unbelievable
trash.")

            If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> can keep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> from ending this <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4 billion</NUMEX> perk, he's more
than earned his fantastic paycheck. Mainly, he uses traditional methods--
making campaign contributions, opening <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> in key <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX>.
There's also the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae Foundation</ENAMEX>, which curries favor by handing out
checks to neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> himself once managed to cadge a
speaking fee arranged by this wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kennedy Center</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chairmanship</ENAMEX> is another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arsenal</ENAMEX>. It's pathetically easy to
play on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s cultural pretensions--"We're a sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX>, aren't we? Aren't we?"--something <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abe Fortas</ENAMEX> discovered
when he managed to distract attention from his corruption by playing classical
violin in public. By cosponsoring free <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kennedy Center</ENAMEX> concerts with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> purchases the goodwill of an insecure city
and simultaneously cozies up to a journalistic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> that could do it a
lot of damage. (Can you imagine the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> sponsoring a concert series
with a less respectable subsidy-hound like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Archer Daniels</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Midland</ENAMEX>'s Dwayne
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andreas</ENAMEX>? Chatterbox can't.)

            But it's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brookings</ENAMEX> connection that really rankles. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brookings</ENAMEX> has been the liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> you could count on to defend
government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprises</ENAMEX> when they need to be defended, and criticize subsidies
when they're unjustified. In essence, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brookings</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> exist to expose
rackets like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX>. But now the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> is the most prominent
public face of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brookings</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> drove by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brookings</ENAMEX> building
and picked up the latest issue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brookings Review</ENAMEX> . There on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
is a large smiling photo of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Johnson</ENAMEX>, impeccably tailored, offering a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">banal Eisner</ENAMEX>-like introduction to the issue.

            To test the chilling effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s stewardship, and to generally make
trouble, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> called up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brookings</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>, several of whom have been
quite courageous in the past, and asked them what they thought of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX>'s
special deal. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> chickened out. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> did not. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosworth</ENAMEX> said that while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> was a "good, hard-charging" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX>, it
should be "fully-taxed," and an "equalization tax" should be levied on its
borrowing to offset the effect of the implicit federal guarantee. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Economist</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Aaron</ENAMEX> said "I don't see any reason why a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> traded on the New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> ... should be given advantages by state and local
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> who have to collect more in taxes from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Plain Joes</ENAMEX> to compensate for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concession</ENAMEX>." Spoken like true <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brookings</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>! The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox Medal</ENAMEX> for
courage in policy analysis to you both!

            
               Memo to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Johnson</ENAMEX>: These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brookings</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wonks</ENAMEX> want to take away your <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4</NUMEX>
billion meal ticket! Obviously they fail to understand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX>'s role as a
"catalyst for community development." Don't you want to squash them like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bugs</ENAMEX>?
Or better yet, get back at them in some quiet, vicious <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX>-like way?

            P.S.: Isn't your new Eisner-like profile a potential liability? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX>
has always preserved its lucrative privileges in part because it's a pretty
obscure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. Now you present a big, juicy public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>. What if some
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> looking for an issue--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kasich</ENAMEX>,
say--portrayed you, the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Million Man</ENAMEX>, as the embodiment of everything wrong
with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>? Just a thought.
