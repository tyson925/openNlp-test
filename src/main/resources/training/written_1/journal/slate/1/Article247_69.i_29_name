            A split in the commentariat: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Writing in Time</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Ferguson</ENAMEX> says
that if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is driven from office it will be not be because he had an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adulterous</ENAMEX> affair while in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, but because "the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> is by many
definitions still a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> ... <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>, fresh from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX>" and "decent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in
positions of power do not exploit the vulnerable for kicks." It will also be
because of "the kind of sex they had"--which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferguson</ENAMEX>, following press accounts
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>'s accounts, characterizes as "strictly one-way, designed for maximum
pleasure" of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. Meanwhile, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> , Larissa
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">MacFarquhar</ENAMEX> rejects the notion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX>. She's "a college
graduate of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>" who will at worst wind up with a great book deal. And
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is "a babe" ...

            Who's right? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MacFarquhar</ENAMEX>'s historical scholarship is open to question. She
seems to believe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> got to "sleep with ... the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>," something the
tapes actually contradict. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> who lives down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> from Chatterbox
complains, "she gives him a blow job and then has to wait around in receiving
lines!" ... On the other hand, suppose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had gone all the way and driven
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> wild with pleasure. Would that change <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferguson</ENAMEX>'s mind? Probably not.
As for the age difference--well, wouldn't it be just typical of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX>
like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferguson</ENAMEX> to define anyone younger than they are as immature, not quite
adult. ...

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> believes the dynamics of human sexuality are complex and subtle,
and it's hard to tell who is taking advantage of whom at any one time. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
may be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>, but you don't get driven from office for being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>. (Name a
successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pol</ENAMEX> who isn't.) He doesn't seem to have egregiously led <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> on
with lies and fake <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JFK</ENAMEX>-style promises of love or matrimony, in the classic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">male-asshole</ENAMEX> mode. Yes, he did talk of strains in his marriage and suggested
the he'd be "alone" after he left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. But that may have been the
truth. Overall, the situation must have been pretty clear. Chatterbox sides
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MacFarquhar</ENAMEX>, at least at this point in time. Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>. There were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>, but they are to be found outside the
relationship. ...

            Oh, yes: If true! Almost forgot.
