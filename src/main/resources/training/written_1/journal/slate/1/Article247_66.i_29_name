            There was former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Stephanopoulos</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s This
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Week</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">furrow-browed</ENAMEX> and "heartbroken with all the evidence
coming out" against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> story was only
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> old, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stephanopoulos</ENAMEX> popped up on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Morning America to</ENAMEX>
demonstrate his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>. "These are probably the most serious allegations yet
leveled against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. There's no question that, if they're true, they
... could lead to impeachment proceedings."

            Is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> alone in thinking there is something strange and even
disgusting about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stephanopoulos</ENAMEX>' eager show of independence from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>?
The problem isn't so much his disloyalty. Political figures turn on each other
from time to time, for good and bad reasons; we're used to it. Stephanopoulos
wants to run for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and doesn't want to seem a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> stooge. By
lending credence to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> charges, and treating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s familiar
defenses as the lies and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-lies they seem to be, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stephanopoulos</ENAMEX> shows he's
not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool</ENAMEX>.

            The trouble is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephanopoulos</ENAMEX> himself helped propagate those lies in
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1992</TIMEX> campaign, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gennifer Flowers</ENAMEX> first brought
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s philandering to public attention, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stephanopoulos</ENAMEX>--as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s chief
spinner, distracter, and all-around bullshit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>--played a crucial role in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">discrediting Flowers</ENAMEX> and anyone else who tried to point out the truth, namely
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had a disturbing zipper problem. (Don't say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stephanopoulos</ENAMEX> didn't
know. Again, he's not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool</ENAMEX>.) Simply put, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephanopoulos</ENAMEX> did as much as any
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> into the mess he now so telegenically laments.

            The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> documentary The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War Room</ENAMEX> captures some of his efforts on
tape. Early in the film, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flowers</ENAMEX> crisis in full bloom, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Donaldson</ENAMEX>
interviews <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephanopoulos</ENAMEX>, who blames it all on the "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> attack
machine." "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has no character problem," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephanopoulos</ENAMEX> declares.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson</ENAMEX> suggests that on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minutes Clinton</ENAMEX> had admitted to
infidelity. "He said he had problems in his marriage," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephanopoulos</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correcting Donaldson</ENAMEX>'s deviation from the pre-scripted fudge-phrase of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>.
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>, of course, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> claim that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> admitted
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">infidelity on 60 Minutes</ENAMEX> and that the fully informed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> simply
didn't care.)

            Near the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">The War Room</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephanopoulos</ENAMEX> gets a call from someone
who apparently claims to have a list of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> paramours, which he is about to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">publicize</ENAMEX>. Stephanopoulos skillfully bullies and cajoles him into keeping
quiet. "You would be laughed at ..." he tells the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX>. "I guarantee you that
if you do this you'll never work in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> politics again. ... Nobody will
believe you and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will think you're scum."

            You might say that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stephanopoulos</ENAMEX> helped invent the philander-protection
techniques that seem to have made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> so overconfident of his ability to
not get caught. He was one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s principal enablers, to use a word
employed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maureen Dowd</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> . When <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>
wonder why there is so much resentment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, they don't need to look much
further than the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Big Lie</ENAMEX> about philandering that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stephanopoulos, Carville</ENAMEX> (and
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cooperative campaign</ENAMEX> press corps) helped to put over in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>.

            Now the dissembler and enabler has become the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC News</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX>.
It's as if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy Cohn</ENAMEX> went on television in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-'50s</TIMEX> to soberly rue the
damage wreaked by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe McCarthy</ENAMEX>, without any apology for his own role. Much
has been made of the way famous wrongdoers (e.g.: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Morris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marv Albert</ENAMEX>)
rebound too quickly in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX> culture. But usually at least a nanosecond
of contrition is required. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stephanopoulos</ENAMEX> is cashing in without even going
through the minimal motions of holding himself accountable for misleading the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, as is now increasingly clear, was a time bomb waiting to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">explode</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stephanopoulos</ENAMEX> helped smuggle him into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and
muffled the ticking.
