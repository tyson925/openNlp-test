            What's the deal with the
post-election editions of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Varnish Remover"?</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varnish</ENAMEX>" has quickly become one of the least
interesting columns in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>. I've always admired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Shrum</ENAMEX> in his multiple
incarnations as political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handler</ENAMEX>, pundit, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, etc. I loved his
deconstruction of the political ads; and he's good--as far as these things can
go--in taking apart "commercial" commercials. But maybe you're not putting the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guy</ENAMEX>'s talents to the best use.

            We may
live in a consumer society, and our politics may be thoroughly commodified--but
I just don't care about taking apart these ads. They're pretty transparent to
start with! I hope you keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shrum</ENAMEX> on as a contributor to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>. But maybe
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Varnish Remover</ENAMEX>" should be removed altogether--at least until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall</TIMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>.

            The recent dialogue in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>
between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Cohen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome Groopman</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Is the AIDS Epidemic</ENAMEX>
Over<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>" begged the more important question of whether government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>
are concealing the true nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> epidemic--particularly as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">War Syndrome</ENAMEX> debacle unravels. The conclusion to be drawn from my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine years</TIMEX> of
reporting on the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> epidemic for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native</ENAMEX> is a somber one:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX>, and uncritical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> have been led down a tragic
primrose path.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX>,
compelling research has been published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a new</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS-related</ENAMEX> virus named
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Herpes Virus 6</ENAMEX> that suggests this virus may be more important in causing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> collapse in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> is. Wouldn't it be ironic if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> were
"obsessed" with finding a vaccine to protect against the wrong virus, and if
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sullivan</ENAMEX> is turning himself into a protease-inhibitor toxic waste <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dump</ENAMEX> site
with the help of well-meaning clinicians such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groopman</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> failed
to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> story right?

            I suspect
that not only will <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Herpes Virus 6</ENAMEX> soon emerge as an extremely important
pathogen, but there will be other surprises related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> epidemic yet to
come for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen, and Groopman</ENAMEX>.

            I am generally a fan of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Kinsley</ENAMEX>'s, but I must take issue with his recent article, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">From Ponzi Scheme to Shell Game</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinsley</ENAMEX> fails to address the main
point of the privatization argument: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> changes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s behavior.
Most importantly, it reduces the incentive to save for retirement. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
Security were changed to a funded scheme, where the payments would be used for
real investment instead of being transferred for current consumption, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> savings rate would rise. (That is, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> taxes would be real
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">savings</ENAMEX> instead of merely transfers. It would be equivalent to everyone saving
for themselves.) The higher savings rate would raise the growth rate. The
resulting larger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pie</ENAMEX> could be split up so that everyone, both during and after
the transition, is better off. (For a good exposition of this argument, see
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Feldstein</ENAMEX>'s address to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Economic Association</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1996</TIMEX>
issue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Economic Review</ENAMEX> .)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> is an
unfunded "pay-as-you-go" system--most of the payments into the system are
transferred to current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retirees</ENAMEX> for current consumption, not "saved" as
government bonds. So, the argument that we would simply have to find new buyers
for government bonds is beside the point in the short run--and irrelevant in
the long run, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> will stop running surpluses.

            You can
attack the privatization argument on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main fronts. Maybe the existence of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> doesn't really lower <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s retirement savings. Or, maybe
higher savings wouldn't really increase growth. But you cannot attack the
argument for being a shell game. The point is that you are not merely slicing
up the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pie</ENAMEX>--you are increasing the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pie</ENAMEX>.

            With regard to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s "E-Mail to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editors</ENAMEX>," I would like to suggest an addition to the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Slate 60</ENAMEX>" list: a new
sublist, which could be titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Top 10 Persons Donating Money</ENAMEX> Not Their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Own</ENAMEX>,"
and which would, for now, be led by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> himself, who would like to
spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 billion</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX>' money.

            I am not, however, in a
position to decide whether the odd <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5</NUMEX> bill given by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> out of his own
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pocket</ENAMEX> should be lumped with that money belonging to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that he would
spend--or whether it would entitle him to compete against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$27</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate 60</ENAMEX> rankings.

            Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> did get one thing
right, though: How other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> spend their wealth is none of his business.
