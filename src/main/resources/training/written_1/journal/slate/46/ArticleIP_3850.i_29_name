               Where's
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fleece</ENAMEX>?
            

            It's truly amazing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jack</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shafer</ENAMEX>'s recent article, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Great Fleece Panic of '96</ENAMEX>," takes the New York
Times to task for reporting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>-catalog and retail shortages, then
ends with--can it be?--a sales pitch for where to find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.L. Bean</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land's End</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Crew</ENAMEX> on the Web. True, there were other references at the end of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> for "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Buy Nothing Day</ENAMEX>" and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adbusters</ENAMEX>, but the premise of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shafer</ENAMEX>'s
commentary was that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Tardy Catalogue Shoppers Risk</ENAMEX>
Losing Out" [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 10, 1996</TIMEX>]) fabricated a catalog shortage in order to herd
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> into buying, thereby playing the role of a shameless pawn in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> sales game.

            I was not a "tardy catalogue
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shopper</ENAMEX>." I didn't wait till the last minute. I dogged the pages of a number of
catalogs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> and called in my selections before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> in order
to ensure ample delivery time. What I got was "out of stock," "back-ordered,"
or "not available" for just about everything I chose. I thought I was just
having rotten luck. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Tardy Shoppers</ENAMEX>" article, which
I read for what it was--a consumer report--was a much-needed reality check.

            Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shafer</ENAMEX> obviously didn't order anything from a catalog before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas '96</TIMEX>.

Glass' piece, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon.</ENAMEX>Con," doesn't jibe with my personal experience. I'm a
relatively new Web <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> was attempting to find a book for a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas present</TIMEX> and had struck out at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bookstores</ENAMEX> around
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>. I had heard about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX>, so we went online with my new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Power</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Computing</ENAMEX> machine. We found the book she was looking for, and found a couple of
other interesting books. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> enjoyed browsing through the lists of
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel and National Book Award</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winners</ENAMEX>, as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editors</ENAMEX>'
Favorites" section.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, a couple of days
later, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> e-mailed us, telling us that the hard-to-find volume was, in
fact, out of print, and that the rest of our order was on the way. We got the
books in a timely fashion. In sum, my experience with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> was good. They
didn't work magic by finding books <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bookstores</ENAMEX> couldn't, but they did deliver on
their promises, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> certainly presents some interesting browsing methods
and far better search <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> than most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bookstores</ENAMEX>.

            I'm not
sure precisely why you favor the overblown megabookstores over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX>. They
both have their place and I, for one, am glad that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Borders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnes</ENAMEX> &
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noble</ENAMEX> have some genuine competition. I agree that there is nothing like going
to a bookstore on a cold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, but there is also nothing like
discovering an interesting new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> while sitting in your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in your robe,
sipping a cup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>. How many books they physically have in their warehouse
has no relevance to me.

            In your article "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon.</ENAMEX>Con," you compare
order time on the phone for a traditional bookstore vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX> online, and
wait for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> to show up--while not addressing the question of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">convenience</ENAMEX>.

            Have you
ever had to fight your way through and wait in line at a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnes & Noble</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, or lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, where the closest Borders bookstore is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco</ENAMEX>? You ignore the big picture on how the Internet is changing how we
buy books, and give me nothing but the impression that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>)
does not want to share the spotlight with another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX>.

               The
Amazonian Experience
            

            I chuckled at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, reading
the "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon.</ENAMEX>Con" article, but then stopped, realized that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> was still <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> away, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chait</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX> were serious. Let me
illustrate the absurdity of their review.

            I walked into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borders Books</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">&</ENAMEX> Music to find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Dead Sea Scrolls</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian Myth</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allegro</ENAMEX>. At first I was astonished that I had to walk through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> to find
the archeology section. I then had to read several book spines, using a
well-adapted, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">pseudo-binary</ENAMEX>-search algorithm I have developed in my brain over
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, looking for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s name. It was not to be found. I then stood,
confused, for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few moments</TIMEX>, until a human male confronted me with a question:
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Can</ENAMEX> I help you find something?"

            I figured this must be some
biological version of a search engine, so I said, "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dead Sea Scrolls</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian Myth</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Allegro</ENAMEX>," hoping the query was syntactically
correct. I was disappointed with the speed at which the engine performed, for
he, as did I moments before, searched the archeology section (though with
perhaps a less well-adapted algorithm) and found nothing. Then he suggested the
religion section, toward which I was led (still on foot). He again browsed the
books visually and pulled a tome from the shelf. "Here it is. Is there anything
else I can do?"

            I grabbed the book, looked at
the cover: Yes, indeed, this was the book in question. "Yes," I said. I wanted
the scroll translations and a couple of other books on the same subject. I
didn't know the titles. "A list of all books by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vermes</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> name
unknown, having to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dead Sea Scrolls</ENAMEX>; also, books by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Leigh</ENAMEX> and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guy</ENAMEX> with the last name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baigent</ENAMEX>, on any subject. I need publishing dates and, oh
yeah, prices." By the expression on his face I knew for sure I had blundered
the syntax this time.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> is not a physical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bookstore</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Borders</ENAMEX> is not an electronic bookstore. You can't browse titles
on a shelf if they're not there, and you can't drink caf√© latte over an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asynchronous</ENAMEX> connection. They're different. My first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> order was placed on
a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> and arrived on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>. My last order, placed at about the same time
the article's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> ordered, took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about nine days</TIMEX>. I have paid, with
shipping, about the same for books through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> as I would have at a local
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bookstore</ENAMEX>. But I have found books on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX>'s site that are certainly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nonexistent on Borders</ENAMEX>' shelves. If you gotta order it, you gotta order it.

            I remember taking some time
filling out the form for my initial order; I don't know how long it took, but I
was taking my time, making sure everything was correct. I don't remember it
being difficult. And now, after selecting my books, it takes me less than a
minute to order. I type in my e-mail address, my password, select "credit
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">card</ENAMEX>," punch my way through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three</NUMEX> "are you really sure?" screens, and my
order is in. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> remembers who I am, where my books are going, and my
credit-card information. It couldn't take me <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">37 minutes</TIMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chait</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX>
suggest, even if I were typing with the back of my head.

            Did I mention I never have to
wait in line at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX>?

            Some
trick. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">con</ENAMEX>?
