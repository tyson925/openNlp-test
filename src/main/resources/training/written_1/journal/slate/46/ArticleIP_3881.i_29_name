               Scenes
From a Marriage
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven E.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Landsburg</ENAMEX>'s otherwise excellent analysis in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Marriage</ENAMEX>
Contract" omits the case where there is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> involved, i.e., the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gerri</ENAMEX> would each individually be better off with a divorce,
but their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terri</ENAMEX> would be worse off to a greater degree than the sum of the
benefits to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom and Gerri</ENAMEX>, and may not be involved in the negotiations,
wouldn't it be safe to say that the covenant marriage is clearly superior in
maximizing total well-being?

            In "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Plain Folk</ENAMEX>," an otherwise
fine review of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Anthology of American Folk Music</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Luc Sante</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>:
"[<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">I</ENAMEX>]t is just as surprising to find out that such bluesmen as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hutchinson</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard 'Rabbit</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> were white."

            This was a
surprise to me, because I was sure that among the very few biographical details
known about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> was the fact that he was black. I've checked several sources
and had this confirmed (and seen nothing to the contrary). There is nothing to
this effect in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">liner</ENAMEX> notes. I therefore wonder what the basis for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sante</ENAMEX>'s
statement may have been.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cook</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Thief ...</ENAMEX>
            

            Although it's hard to
disagree with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Surowiecki</ENAMEX>'s roasting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade Cook</ENAMEX> in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Book</ENAMEX> on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cook</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Surowiecki</ENAMEX>'s assertion that the equity stock option market is
"simply a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX>" that "contribute[s] nothing to the smooth functioning of
capital markets" is both wrong and silly. Equity options, just like commodity
and currency futures, can and often do serve a hedging function. Consider, for
example, someone who owns shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> and has a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20</NUMEX> paper profit on
the stock. If that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> were willing to pay extra for the security of
limited downside, she could buy put options with a strike price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$98</NUMEX>, which
would lock in her profit on the shares at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$18</NUMEX>, less whatever the options cost.
Hardly the act of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculator</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX>.

            Equity
options themselves aren't the problem--they have legitimate uses--and without
the ability to lock in positions that equity options offer, certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> might
not be in the equity market in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade Cook</ENAMEX> are the
problem. I wish <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Surowiecki</ENAMEX> had made that distinction.

               To <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Di</ENAMEX>
For
            

            The very insinuation that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Rodham Clinton</ENAMEX> could possibly have anything to learn from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Princess</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> was intriguing enough to make me click on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Carlson</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Di</ENAMEX>."
Though I had hoped for something more interesting than spin control for women
in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s world, I was impressed with the breathtakingly casual lack of
fairness to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first lady</ENAMEX> that created the intriguing premise.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlson</ENAMEX> contends that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX>
was more successful for her causes than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> has been for hers, even though
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> was clearly less committed to her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charity</ENAMEX> work than to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX>-setting
lifestyle. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlson</ENAMEX> writes that "[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">l</ENAMEX>]and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mines</ENAMEX> made it onto the world's agenda
because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> put them there," implying that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> was a success, and that
"there are still <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with no health insurance," implying that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> is a failure.

            Apparently <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlson</ENAMEX> is
unfamiliar with the old saying about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> had to do to
succeed, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlson</ENAMEX>'s mind, was to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> talking. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first lady</ENAMEX>, on the
other hand, had to actually make an unprecedented change in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> public
policy before she could measure up. If we use the same standard for both,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> was a great success (more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> talked about health care than are
talking about land <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mines</ENAMEX>) and, at best, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> is still out on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> (though
I imagine land <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mines</ENAMEX> will go on killing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> to come).

            I'm afraid
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlson</ENAMEX> has been infected with the same virus, epidemic since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX>'s
death, that makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> recast all criteria for a good and successful life in
terms that only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> can meet. No matter that another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> might have done
more good than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX>: She doesn't stand a chance--unless she, too, has the
public relations windfall of a spectacular and tragic death. That's quite a
legacy for the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">princess</ENAMEX>.

            In "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Where the Sidewalk</ENAMEX>
Ends," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Plotz</ENAMEX> reviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CitySearch</ENAMEX> and several other online guides to a
variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. He commended our arts and entertainment coverage,
but concluded that "something is missing ... namely, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>." A more
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> review of the online city guides might have led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plotz</ENAMEX> to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> section of CitySearch7 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, where he might have found the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> he
was looking for.

            He said
that the local guides "ignore politics," although we list and describe the work
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist organizations</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay Area</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.
The charge that our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> is "limited to capsule reviews and short,
cheerleading columns about yuppiedom" is unfair. We write about, and for, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> that reflects the vast sociological spectrum that is part and parcel
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> life. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plotz</ENAMEX> concludes that online guides perceive of cities
solely as "place[s] of consumption," but at CitySearch7 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> we can't
just gobble up our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>--we have to live in it too.

"Endless
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Summer</TIMEX>," on plot holes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contact</ENAMEX> , please allow me to nit-pick your
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nit-picking</ENAMEX>. You remark on the implausibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew McConaughey</ENAMEX> eating
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cracker Jack</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Costa Rican</ENAMEX> jungle; that whole sequence takes place in
Arecibo, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, which, when I last checked, was a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">commonwealth</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>. One can safely assume that they import certain rare delicacies
from the mainland.

            You wonder at how, after the
destruction of the extremely expensive machine, another one is built on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hokkaido</ENAMEX>; the entire premise--spelled out in the film--was that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were built
at the same time, one as a backup. Nor does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hurt</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millionaire</ENAMEX> eccentric
float around on "his own custom-made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mir</ENAMEX>." He is actually on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mir</ENAMEX>, where, he
says, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> are happy to rent him space. Finally, you express shock that
the alien <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jodie Foster</ENAMEX> meets speaks <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>. The whole point is that upon her
arrival they read her memories. Or didn't you find it odd that an alien
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> appeared to her in the form of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>?

            Now, why
didn't you complain about something really important, like how fake the
computer displays were? I mean, everyone knows that in real life computers
don't have 3-D displays and make cool noises. Those pesky movies.

            I feel the need to bring to
your attention a major, major flaw in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">One Woman</ENAMEX>'s
War," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah Kerr</ENAMEX>'s review of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G.I. Jane</ENAMEX> . Toward the end of this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerr</ENAMEX> makes one of the most absurd statements I have ever read. It left
me wondering if she is mentally competent, let alone capable of intelligently
reviewing a film.

            Here's what she said, after
disclosing that she recently saw <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Demi Moore</ENAMEX> on a talk show looking more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">feminine</ENAMEX>, like an "innocent, wistful pixie," than her on-screen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.I. Jane</ENAMEX> : "She did not seem to be a person likely to say 'suck my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dick</ENAMEX>.' It's tempting to conclude from this that she's empty at the core, trying
on different personas to hide her lack of a self."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Hello</ENAMEX>, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerr</ENAMEX>, are you
familiar with the term "acting"? That's what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Demi Moore</ENAMEX> does for a living, and
that's what she was doing in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G.I. Jane</ENAMEX> . Why should it be a surprise that
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> appears different in real life from an on-screen persona? Do you
expect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sigourney Weaver</ENAMEX> to tote around an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uzi</ENAMEX> in real life, looking for aliens
to shoot? If you saw <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Stewart</ENAMEX> on a talk show, and he wasn't wearing his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star Trek</ENAMEX> uniform, would you assume that he was "empty at the core"?

            Someone
with such a clear lack of understanding of the distinction between acting and
being should perhaps not be writing movie reviews.
