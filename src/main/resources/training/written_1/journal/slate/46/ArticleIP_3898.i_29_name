               (r) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX>)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Weisberg</ENAMEX>'s "Happy
Birthday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage Foundation</ENAMEX>" is wrong on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> major point. In it he wrote,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage</ENAMEX> is a tax-exempt 501(c)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, which means it is not
supposed to lobby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>." This is not true. Nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, or
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">501</NUMEX>(c)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)s, are in fact encouraged to lobby under existing law, subject to
certain limitations.

            When nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
lobby, they make an invaluable contribution to the public-policy process.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Charities</ENAMEX> and nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> speak for the public interest, not
private interests. They often represent large numbers of ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> on
issues like the environment or consumer protection, or vulnerable populations
who lack the resources or skills to assert their basic rights.

            Moreover, as service
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX> are often on the front lines combating the worst problems
besetting our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. Their voices help produce more efficient and
effective public policy. Although we might disagree with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX>, as a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">501</NUMEX>(c)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>), they are doing nothing wrong by lobbying.

            Current law does prohibit
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">501</NUMEX>(c)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)s from working for or against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, and that
is appropriate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nonprofits</ENAMEX> also are prohibited from using federal funds for the
purposes of lobbying (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget Circular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-122</ENAMEX>), but they may
lobby using other funding sources, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX> or their membership.

            In devising the laws
governing nonprofit lobbying, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> recognized that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">501</NUMEX>(c)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)s should be
encouraged to exercise their <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> rights. Certainly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is in
no danger of being overrun by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gucci</ENAMEX>-clad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyists</ENAMEX> working for the poor and the
environment.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weisberg</ENAMEX>'s mistake reflects a common misconception. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX>
recently made the exact same error in discussing 501(c)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)s.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Code</ENAMEX> does not encourage lobbying by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">501</NUMEX>(c)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>, but it does allow it under limited circumstances. Here's a

               Hot
Air
            

            I read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Plotz</ENAMEX>'s
"The (Not
Yet) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Around-the-World Balloonists</ENAMEX>" on a flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX>, sitting
next to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Zealander</ENAMEX> who had just won a transatlantic rowing race. Perhaps
that's why I feel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plotz</ENAMEX>'s article is the silliest explanation of the logic of
adventure I've ever read. In particular, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plotz</ENAMEX>'s notion that adventures used to
be (and need to be) driven by practical considerations, such as opening trade
routes, strikes me as daft. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plotz</ENAMEX> is right that the number of challenges
remaining seems to be decreasing--it could hardly increase--I find it almost
impossible to believe that previous record-setters were driven by the kind of
practical, commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plotz</ENAMEX> ascribes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferdinand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Magellan</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Rutan</ENAMEX>.

            If his
theory were true, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Hillary</ENAMEX>'s ascent of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Everest</ENAMEX> would have been
motivated by a desire to test new oxygen <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joshua Slocum</ENAMEX> would have
circumnavigated the world in order rack up frequent-sailing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX>. Yes, of
course balloons are a uniquely terrible mode of transportation. Sticking ice
axes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX> is a pretty stupid way to get to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">29,000 feet</NUMEX> as
well. The motivation of adventurers everywhere is to achieve something no one
else has achieved and to derive the pleasure that arises from that--and, not
incidentally, to get famous by writing books about it. And the reason why the
rest of us sit in our armchairs and read about these accomplishments is because
we wish we'd done something as interesting with our time. If there is an
occasional practical benefit to these shenanigans, so much the better. In the
meantime, the world will probably be content to support the world of adventure
through an occasional perilous walk to Borders.

               Deflating Lindy
            

            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Plotz</ENAMEX>
("The [Not
Yet] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Around-the-World Balloonists"</ENAMEX>), "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Lindbergh</ENAMEX>'s crossing wasn't
just a stunt: It made real the idea of transatlantic air travel." By the time
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Lindbergh</ENAMEX> made the first solo crossing, the idea of transatlantic air
travel had already been made real by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flyers</ENAMEX> who had crossed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocean</ENAMEX>.

            While
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lindbergh</ENAMEX>'s crossing certainly captured the public imagination (as some of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">balloonists</ENAMEX> have also), it did little to advance the technology of
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">aviation.</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weisberg</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No Respect</ENAMEX>," on why the establishment hates <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, was
outstanding. Of all the obnoxious, hypocritical statements he collected, the
worst was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally Quinn</ENAMEX> on why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> "who have attained a certain social or
political position" feel dissed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. Let's see: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> attained his
position by being elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinn</ENAMEX> attained hers by marrying her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>.
And he's supposed to suck up to her? Another reason for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgetown</ENAMEX>'s hostility
is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> tax increase fell hardest on upper-crust types. They
like to talk about their social consciences, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is the first political
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> to make them put their money where their mouths are.

               Remember
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venn</ENAMEX>?
            

            I wondered if someone
writing for 
                  Slate
                could be dispassionate, honest, and objective
about the browser issue. I wish I could say that "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">You Be the Judge</ENAMEX>" fit the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bill</ENAMEX>, but I just don't buy it. I tried your experiment. Yes indeed, remove
those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> .<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dll</ENAMEX> files and several other files don't work correctly. But
restore those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> files without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4</ENAMEX> and guess what? Everything runs
just fine.

            So, as far as I can see, the
whole distinction really boils down to a few overlapping files. This is hardly
an existential issue. It reminds me of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venn</ENAMEX> diagram with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> overlapping
circles, A and B. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> removes all of A (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">IE 4</NUMEX>), including the little
portion that overlaps B (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Windows 95</ENAMEX>), B is no longer a viable whole.

            The distinction that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> refuses to admit, however, is that it can and should remove all of A
that is not part of B. It can and should include in its operating system those
.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dll</ENAMEX> files that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Windows 95</ENAMEX> and other applications need. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> at that
firm know full well which .<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dll</ENAMEX> files could and would be needed by other
applications, including the OS.

            This reminds me of buying a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> without a factory-installed stereo. Just because I didn't buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s stereo
doesn't mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> left out the battery or the fuse box, both of which are
needed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to install and operate a stereo after the purchase.

            The
bullies at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> are simply refusing to obey the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX>'s orders and are
trying to obscure the issue with a lot of techie hot air. They should be fined
heavily for contempt of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>. Ultimately, I suspect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> will need to
be broken up (much as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> was), with the OS <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> allowed to retain its
natural monopoly but the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> forced to face the same competitive
pressures that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrants</ENAMEX> face.
