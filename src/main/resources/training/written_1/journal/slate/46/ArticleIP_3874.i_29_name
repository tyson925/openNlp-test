Deficiency
            

            As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> who uses
testimony compelled by subpoena to investigate white-collar crime, I was
dismayed to read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akhil Reed Amar</ENAMEX>'s proposal, in "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Right</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX>," to alter
the meaning of immunity to allow for the fruits of immunized testimony to be
used against a criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX>.

            All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> have an
obligation to represent their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> to the fullest extent allowed by law. If
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amar</ENAMEX>'s proposal became law, I would be obligated to force all
investigation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> to testify just so that I could obtain the fruits of the
testimony. It would be an excellent investigative tool.

            
Unfortunately, it would be an excellent investigative tool precisely because it
would eviscerate the constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination. While it
would make my job easier, it would also make this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> a less desirable
place to live.

            There are apparently no
boundaries to the misleading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologizing</ENAMEX> of human experiences. Now, in
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyson's Choice</ENAMEX>,"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Itell</ENAMEX> claims that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Tyson</ENAMEX> "may be ... afflicted" with
"manic-depressive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>," as evidenced by his having bitten off part of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evander Holyfield</ENAMEX>'s ear.

            Part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Itell</ENAMEX>'s
unintentionally hilarious evidence for his conditional diagnosis is the alleged
historic "connection ... between mania and artistic achievement," which, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> claims, has been "known" since ancient times. From this dubious premise
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Itell</ENAMEX> spins to his more preposterous conclusion that there "may well be a
similar relationship ... between <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">manic depression</ENAMEX> and sporting achievement."
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Itell</NUMEX> points as evidence to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX>--one of whom was depressed--and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychiatrist</ENAMEX> who muses that "there are many other cases."

            But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s exculpatory
coup de gr√¢ce is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyson</ENAMEX>'s claim that a psychiatric illness caused him to
do things to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Givens</ENAMEX> (his former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>) that "he would normally never do."
Then, finalizing his ode to non sequiturs, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Itell</ENAMEX> analogizes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyson</ENAMEX>'s alleged
"disease" to a "fatal disease" and even recommends that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyson</ENAMEX> take psychoactive
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and undergo a "medical clearance" on his behavior.

            None of
this nonmedical and simply silly analysis should blind the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> to what
happened in reasonably clear terms: An irresponsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boxer</ENAMEX>, motivated by fear
of losing, took the easy way out, which entailed, he correctly anticipated,
relatively few negative consequences. In previous fights, wherein he was
winning or had a good chance to win, his "illness" did not manifest itself.
Much alleged "psychotic illness" is the result of rational, if wrong-headed,
calculation.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Stein</ENAMEX>'s "On Being a

anti-Semitism than it does about the centrality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> experience. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stein</ENAMEX>
obviously chose to remember on which side his <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> was buttered rather than
address the larger issue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> world.

            Of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">disgraceful anti-Semitic</ENAMEX> utterances, made public in recently revealed tapes,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> can only meekly remark, "Apparently, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> said some things that I
wish he had not said." Surely an entry for the understatement of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>.

            As reported in the press, at
long last, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>, in the privacy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oval Office</ENAMEX>, said to his
trusted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>, we have the power. Are we using it to investigate the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>? ... I can only hope that we are doing a little persecuting." Further,
"Please give me the names of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>." And, "How about the rich <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>? The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>
is full of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX>."

            Even such a staunch
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">supporter</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William F. Buckley Jr.</ENAMEX> squirmed in embarrassment as he defended
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>, calling him "paranoid" and dismissing his anti-Semitism as "all
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">foam</ENAMEX>, no teeth," pointing out that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kissinger</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Safire</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herb Stein</ENAMEX> continued to support him although it was "unlikely" that they
were "unaware" of his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Semitic</ENAMEX> tendencies.

            Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> can now write:
"But I know of nothing in his behavior to me, to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, or to
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> in general that entitles him to anything less than my total loyalty."

            Loyalty?
To a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> who can mouth (and therefore think) such dangerous anti-Semitic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dynamite</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX>'s posture is that of one who puts self-interest above
principle, opportunism above ethics. In so doing he fails the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,
and does a grave disservice to the sense of fairness and decency to all.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> responds: What was in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s heart and soul, and whether that
was represented by the offensive things he said to some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, I do not know.
I can only reflect my own experience and observation. I never had any reason to
think that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Semitic</ENAMEX>. I never heard him make a remark that was
in the slightest degree suggestive of such an attitude. He was unfailingly
friendly and sympathetic not only to me but also to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
As is well known, he appointed and relied upon a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kissinger</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burns</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Safire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garment</ENAMEX>, and me. His longtime political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mentor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray Chotiner</ENAMEX>,
was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jewish</TIMEX>. He defended <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> when it was in the greatest danger of its
history, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> regarded him as their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>.

            The statement in my article,
"I know of nothing in his behavior to me, to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, or to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>
in general that entitles him to anything less than my total loyalty," is quite
precise. It said neither more nor less than I meant and I stand by it.

            Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rangell</ENAMEX> attributes despicable motives to me, which can be summed up as
"opportunism." Since Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rangell</ENAMEX> does not know me, I think it inappropriate for
him to make such judgments about me.

            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seth Stevenson</ENAMEX>,
in "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bound</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chains</ENAMEX>," electronic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> mail is campaigned against by certain Web sites
on the grounds that it "wastes Internet bandwidth, reduces productivity, and
exploits human emotions." He goes on to consider the "upside" to such mail, and
closes by noting (perhaps jokingly) that he recently forwarded some on to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>. Electronic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> mail certainly is objectionable for the reasons
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevenson</ENAMEX> notes. But more importantly, it is specifically outlawed on virtually
all electronic-mail systems. The Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Engineering Task Force</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFC</ENAMEX> on
Netiquette
Guidelines instructs: "Never send <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> letters via electronic mail. Chain
letters are forbidden on the Internet. Your network privileges will be revoked.
Notify your local system <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX>."

can result in its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>' accounts being revoked.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weisberg</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Not Just Talk</ENAMEX>" that a national conversation on race that
focused on ways of lessening de facto segregation would be a good thing.
However, unless I am mistaken, this is not the conversation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has proposed. It seems that we are in for a conversation about <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">race</ENAMEX> as
such, isolated from specific problems and specific policy proposals. Thus, the
results are more likely to be those of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheldon Hackney</ENAMEX>'s ill-conceived
multicultural conversations, which disintegrated, predictably, into the type of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entrenched</ENAMEX>, obscurantist--indeed segregationist--identity-politics posing that
is so familiar to those of us who have spent time on the campuses of elite
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>.

            
Preliminary, local conversations on race have already been held in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carolina</ENAMEX>, and they have gone nowhere. They have been, as they will be at the
national level, conversations about racism. These make some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> feel good by
encouraging them to feel angry, and they make others feel good by letting them
feel guilty, but they make the rest of us feel a distinctly tight sensation in
our chests, as our hopes for a rational discussion are systematically
disappointed. And they don't begin to address the concrete socioeconomic
problems that exacerbate racial strife in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Weisberg</ENAMEX>
correctly highlights.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Surowiecki</ENAMEX> writes in
"You Name
It": "One can only speculate how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Combined</ENAMEX>
Insurance explained to themselves their decision to adopt the name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aon</ENAMEX>."
Actually, anyone who knows anything about the insurance business understands
the reason for the change. Combined Insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Company</ENAMEX> still exists and writes
insurance under that name. The parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> recently acquired by merger the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">world</ENAMEX>'s largest insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">broker</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexander & Alexander Services Inc.</ENAMEX>, and
also a large <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bain Hogg Group plc.</ENAMEX>, which does substantial
business in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander & Alexander</ENAMEX> was known to all
insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> as "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A&A</ENAMEX>," which was a name with considerable brand
value. So the newly merged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had several problems: how to announce to the
world that it was now not only an insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">underwriter</ENAMEX>, but also a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX>; how
to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A&A</ENAMEX> brand value, without appearing simply to be gobbling up
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bain Hogg</ENAMEX>; and how to do this with a name that is easy to say in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> languages.

            The answer, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aon</ENAMEX>," is to my
mind quite elegant. It keeps the initial capital A and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> syllables
of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A&A</ENAMEX>" (pronounced "A 'n' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A"</ENAMEX>); it puns on "eon," which implies longevity
and stability--a desirable connotation for an insurance-services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>,
especially one that has just undergone a major and disruptive change; it has a
remote but perceptible similarity in sound to "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bain"</ENAMEX>; and it gives the company
a unique, legally protectable, and memorable name, unlike the generic "Combined
Insurance" moniker. The switch to "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Aon</ENAMEX>" is very similar to the process that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard Oil of New Jersey</ENAMEX>, whose main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subsidiary</ENAMEX> marketed in most places under
the same "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esso</ENAMEX>," went through when it switched to "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX>." Although I have no
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> of knowing, I wouldn't be surprised if the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> modeled their choice
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> example.

            You'll
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">notice</ENAMEX> that in my last sentence I idly speculated on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aon company</ENAMEX>'s use of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> example. That's all right for me; I'm just a letter-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>

in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and further slippage in the trade balance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>--aren't of equal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> runs a relatively small
merchandise-trade deficit with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> relative to its deficit with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> (in

(notably the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> mark and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">lira</NUMEX>) is worrisome, it is nowhere near

            Another point to consider is
that, for much of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> productivity growth has far outpaced that of
its major <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>. This means that there is potential for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> dollar to grow, relative to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, without giving rise to
a further significant worsening of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade balance with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.

            In
closing, while I agree with you that a rising <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency relative to its
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> may not be a positive development, it is certainly not "of

of those books, movies, etc., that I haven't read).

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) The synopsis infers that
the narrative is propelled by an incident--the protagonist loses his job--which
in fact does not occur until the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> pages of the novel. And he is offered
a better job. Which he turns down.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The protagonist in no way
"commandeers a television station." In fact, he becomes the inadvertent subject
of a taped remote at the college <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX>.

            OK,
seemingly small details. But such are the delights of every <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russo</ENAMEX> novel, so you
