            In "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">In Praise of Cheap</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Krugman</ENAMEX> suggests that because Third World <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are better
off working in multinational <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> than living off garbage dumps, we should
respect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">multinationals</ENAMEX> for their contribution and avoid policies
establishing basic labor standards. But the comparison should be between what
was done and what should have been done, not what would have occurred
otherwise. Consider the following: A boat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> comes upon a drowning woman
in a lake, saves her but then rapes her.

            Now according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krugman</ENAMEX>,
since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> is better off than she would have been otherwise, the boat
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">captain</ENAMEX> is to be admired and rewarded for what he has done. My complaints about
the lack of social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> in this case are simply dismissed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krugman</ENAMEX> as
lofty self-righteousness.

            There are
valid concerns as to the potential effectiveness of international labor
standards, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krugman</ENAMEX> provides no theoretical or empirical proof that they
would not improve the lives of Third World <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. The capital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> (and
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> World <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>) are collecting significant "rents" from these
activities. It may be possible to force them to share these more equitably with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. Back to the example: If the boat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> is restricted to only
charging the woman <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20</NUMEX>, he may still choose to save her.

               Just
Overprice It
            

            I enjoyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Krugman</ENAMEX>'s
"In Praise of Cheap
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX>," but he seems to miss the point.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> enjoy low
prices. That is why there is this boom in foreign manufacturing, and that is
why "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dollar Stores</ENAMEX>" are so popular. When a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX> can walk into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and,
for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only one dollar</NUMEX>, purchase something that was manufactured in the Third
World, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> can understand why the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who made that item earns
only <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">60 cents</NUMEX> an hour.

            The moral
questions and outrage arise, however, when a consumer forks over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$129</NUMEX> for a
pair of sneakers that were assembled cheaply in some Third World country.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sneaker manufacturers</ENAMEX>, at this point, seem a tad gluttonous.

               Nikenation
            

            I agree with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine-tenths</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Krugman</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">In</ENAMEX>
Praise of Cheap <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX>." We cannot meaningfully compare wages in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Nor can we often comprehend the far bleaker alternatives
to these jobs that exist in the industrializing Third World.

            But
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krugman</ENAMEX> takes no account of how political violence can factor into this
equation. If arrests, imprisonments, and worse prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in Third World
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> from making claims for better wages and working conditions, then
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krugman</ENAMEX>'s system of global supply and demand starts to come unhinged. The moral
component to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krugman</ENAMEX>'s argument is that we should not allow our squeamishness
to prevent Third World <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> from deciding that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 cents</NUMEX> a day making
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reeboks</ENAMEX> is better than a deadening, declining rural poverty. No argument here.
But if those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are compelled to work for low wages by extraeconomic
threats, then that choice is an illusory one.

            I was enjoying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weisberg</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Battered-Republican Syndrome</ENAMEX>" until he equated support for
parental rights with support for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> abuse. I abhor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> abuse and feel that
the abusers should be punished, but corporal discipline is different.

            When a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> continues to
behave in a way that can cause harm to himself or to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, a spanking
can be extremely effective. I do support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who don't believe in corporal
punishment--if they can raise their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> well without an occasional
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spanking</ENAMEX>, more power to them. But I think the most damage is done to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
who receive no discipline at all.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Weisberg</ENAMEX>
would have everyone believe that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and I are evil or maladjusted because
we have spanked our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. But we are highly responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who have
very happy, confident, well-behaved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. They know that we love them and
they also know that we mean what we say. I'm disappointed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weisberg</ENAMEX>'s lapse
of logic and lack of understanding of what it means to be a good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>.

            In "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Human Clones:</ENAMEX>
Why Not?" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathan Myhrvold</ENAMEX> makes the preposterous assertion that calls for a
ban on cloning amount to discrimination against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> based on another genetic
trait.

            Racism is the very thing
that makes human cloning insidious. Once human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cloning</ENAMEX> is perfected, as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myhrvold</ENAMEX> presumes it will be, who will utilize this method of procreation?
Those who have access to it. Who will have access to it? Those who live in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologically</ENAMEX> advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> and have the financial resources to afford
such a luxury: Caucasian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.

            Cloning
will merely present nervous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Caucasian men</ENAMEX> with the means to attempt to ensure
that they aren't outnumbered by those threatening masses of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">races</ENAMEX> on what
they consider their own territory. He defines genocide as "seeking to eliminate
that which is different," and argues that bans on cloning fall into that
category. But cloning does not produce "that which is different." It produces
the same product repeatedly. Bans against human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cloning</ENAMEX> are the only protection
the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> has against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Brother</ENAMEX> social and genetic engineering.

            In the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dialogue" on Gay Marriage</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Frum</ENAMEX> writes that "[c]<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hildren</ENAMEX> raised without
both biological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times as likely as other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to commit crimes, to drop out of school, to get pregnant in their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX>, to be unemployed as young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>." During the welfare-reform debate, he
blamed the welfare system for the ills of single-parent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Now he blames
liberalized marriage and divorce laws.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> that he doesn't say
that these problems are associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of divorced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, only that
they're problems of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> "raised without both biological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>." That
includes many illegitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orphans</ENAMEX>, and abandoned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Someone
truly interested in understanding the causes might want to know how many of
these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are raised in poverty, are born to drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addicts</ENAMEX>, or had fathers
who never married or even lived with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>. Someone without such a big
ax to grind might also look into a comparison of statistics for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> raised
by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> nonbiological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, such as adoptees and stepparents, and
compare them with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> raised by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> biological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> in deeply unhappy
and/or abusive relationships.

            But not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frum</ENAMEX>. He's happy to toss out this statistic that folds in all possible
childhood abandonment, and pin the blame entirely on the reforms in the divorce
laws: "Only now are we beginning to appreciate the extent of the damage done,"
he writes. Fine. Let's just see if he remembers this next time the subject of
welfare comes up.
