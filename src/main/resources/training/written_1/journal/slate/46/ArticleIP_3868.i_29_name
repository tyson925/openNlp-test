match, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> characterizes a perceived backlash against technology as
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Club</ENAMEX> thinking." But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Club</ENAMEX> hardly sees any threats to humanity
arising from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kasparov</ENAMEX>'s battle for greatest chess <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep Blue</ENAMEX>.

            What does
merit our suspicion is a blind faith in the ability of machines and chemicals

"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pay Scales in</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black and White</ENAMEX>" ignores the simple fact that racism is nonrational.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX> do not say to themselves, "I am going to ignore the qualifications of
this black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> even though it will hurt my bottom line." Rather, a racist
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> does not even see those qualifications.

            Landsburg
would do well to remember that, while mathematics is a wonderfully consistent,
logical system of symbols, those very characteristics greatly limit its
usefulness in describing the decisions we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> make on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> basis. A

discrimination doesn't exist (in any serious form) runs up against the hard
fact that research shows it to exist. This is another example of abstract
economic theory ignoring reality. After all, such calculations would prove that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> never prefer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cronies</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> or pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, that they

            It is a

            While I do not presume to
speak for all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>, I am sure that the vast
majority of us are not endeared to an otherwise excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webzine</ENAMEX> that insists
on printing quasi-intellectual racist nonsense from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven E. Landsburg</ENAMEX>, such
as his latest article, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pay Scales in Black</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>."

            Landsburg attempts, by
economic sleight of hand, to argue that racism does not exist in corporate
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> because it would not be in its bottom-line interest for it to do so. By
making racism into some financial decision on the part of rational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
is not only wrong, but insulting. This sort of scientific objectivism is one of
the major failures of applying the scientific method to economics. He sees the
problem in a vacuum, instead of attempting to look at the entire picture.

            The
majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX> can't afford the same lifestyles and education as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> because they have not been allowed the opportunities in the past to take
advantage of good jobs and good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> must remember that they are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, not physicists (although they stole all of their mathematics
from physics), that the representative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> does not exist in the real world,
and that they must adjust their analysis accordingly. I do not mean that racism
must be assumed and then disproved, although the track record of corporate
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> would almost make this allowable, but that assumptions must be
thoroughly examined for all implications before even the first result is
paraded about like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>'s new clothes.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven E.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Landsburg</ENAMEX> replies: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Terry</ENAMEX> has missed the point completely. Of
course racism is nonrational. The point is that nonrational behavior
becomes less likely as it becomes more expensive. So to determine the
likelihood of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> discrimination, it's certainly relevant to figure out
how expensive it is. If the answer were "<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX> of corporate profits,"
irrational racism would be pretty plausible. Because the answer is "<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">150 percent</NUMEX>
of corporate profits," the plausibility falls dramatically.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Ciccarello</ENAMEX> has a more
interesting observation, which is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who make hiring decisions in
large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> might not have the interests of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> or the shareholders
foremost in their minds. The question then is whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> or the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX> would be likely to take action to improve the performance of
middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. And again, the answer depends on how expensive it is to
ignore such improvements. Nobody is claiming that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> operate
rationally or efficiently all the time. The claim is that irrational and
inefficient behavior is more likely to disappear when it is very expensive--and
in this case it is very expensive.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude S. Fischer</ENAMEX>'s bald
assertion that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> discrimination has been shown to be a significant
factor in explaining black/white wage differentials is false. I note that he
gives no citations.

            In the same deceptive spirit,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fischer</ENAMEX> claims that a similar calculation would indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> never
prefer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cronies</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, or that they never goof off on the golf
course--even though he makes no attempt to supply that calculation. I do not
believe he can do so. There is no doubt that nepotism and golfing are costly,
but to suggest that they are costly at anything like the level of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">150 percent</NUMEX>
of corporate profits is just ridiculous. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fischer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> also to my citing
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Curve</ENAMEX> , despite the fact that I did not cite it with
approval.

            Finally,
while I'm reluctant to respond to anybody who thinks that the laws of
arithmetic can be "quasi-intellectual racist nonsense," I note that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milton</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appling</ENAMEX> switches sides in the middle of his letter. By citing differences in
educational opportunity he offers an alternative to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX>-discrimination
theory of racial wage differentials. That's just what I was calling for in my
column.

            As a security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> at

Profile."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is a wonderful
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. All over the world, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are subjected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> to the most appalling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">humiliations</ENAMEX>--their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> and possessions searched, their livelihoods
threatened, their very safety jeopardized--by obnoxious, petty, corrupt
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of brutal, repressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regimes</ENAMEX>. Worst of all, they must suffer
in silence, knowing that a callous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> cares little about their miserable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fates</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is different: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Here</ENAMEX>, even a pampered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">multimillionaire</ENAMEX> can
gripe about having his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">luggage</ENAMEX> inspected at an airport, confident of a
sympathetic hearing. When it comes to righteous outrage, this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> is truly
blessed.

            I suspect
that it was the randomness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simonyi</ENAMEX>'s search and not its sinister
"profile" implications that really bothered him. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Profiles</ENAMEX>, after all, don't
usually target wealthy software <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>, whereas random checks can't
