About <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX>, Part 1
            

            I would just like to say how
much I have enjoyed reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Shearer</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dispatches</ENAMEX>" from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.J.</ENAMEX> civil trial. Brilliantly well written,
and with the right mix of sarcasm and serious analysis, they have been
virtually unmissable throughout the trial. The same can be said for his earlier
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Diary</ENAMEX>" entries on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> party conventions during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>.

            Now that
the civil trial has come to a conclusion, does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> have any more projects up
its sleeve for him to have a crack at?

About <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX>, Part 2
            

            You really
should issue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Shearer</ENAMEX>'s incredible <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.J.</ENAMEX> "Dispatches" in book form. His "coverage" has been far more
insightful than anything else for either the criminal or the civil trial
(including the acclaimed book by that sly revisionist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Toobin</ENAMEX>). He also
added something this whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">escapade</ENAMEX> has needed from the start--a little humor.
The material ought to have much broader exposure.

            Funny you
should ask. We've collected all of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.J.</ENAMEX> "Dispatches" into one
gargantuan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Word</ENAMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe Acrobat</ENAMEX>) document that will you can

               It Was a
Simple Error
            

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Week/ The Spin"</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb.</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, 1997</TIMEX>) contained a terrible error: "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welfare</ENAMEX> reform was the hot topic at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Governors' Association</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> meeting. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX>
supported restoration of aid to illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> (which was cut in the new
welfare law)."

            
Unfortunately, the substitution of "illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>" for "legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>"
in this blurb rendered this passage not only factually inaccurate, but
politically unintelligible. The cuts the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> complained about were the
elimination of benefits to legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>, who heretofore have been
treated pretty much the same as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> with regard to welfare benefits. The
big cuts were in SSI benefits to current legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>, and these
cuts accounted for most of the welfare reform "savings." In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, cutting
legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> off federal aid simply dumps them onto local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>, even
though <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of poor continue to arrive. Your coverage made a complicated
subject even more obscure and made light of a sea change in the treatment of
immigrants which carries grave human consequences. Was it a simple error or
muddled arrogance?

            I enjoyed
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pop</ENAMEX>
Technology," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Menand</ENAMEX>'s take on the Star Wars legacy,
particularly his observation that human beings have become dwarfed by
computer-created images on the big screen. It strikes me as a modern-day
perversion of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> landscape paintings in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are depicted
as miniscule figures at the base of immense mountains and valleys. Will our
generation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> be interpreted as similarly insignificant in the face of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colossal</ENAMEX> technology?

Your <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Thoughts?</ENAMEX>" by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathan Myhrvold</ENAMEX> was excellent! While I usually go to
Slate for the political and social insights (especially those by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Weisberg</ENAMEX> [see also
his latest "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Strange Bedfellow</ENAMEX>"]), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myhrvold</ENAMEX>'s article was the first
really well done, concrete analysis of an aspect of the Web that I have ever
seen. I hope you all continue to capitalize on your ownership by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> to
get some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s brainpower on your pages.

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price</ENAMEX>
Is Right
            

            I read
with interest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathan Myhrvold</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Penny for</ENAMEX>
Your <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Thoughts?</ENAMEX>"--especially the comparison between Internet micropayments
and the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dutch Auction</ENAMEX>"-style downward pricing structure of movies. The
movie-going experience does have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other advantage over the other forms of
intellectual stimulation you mentioned, however: nonregulatory price caps.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patrons</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waterworld</ENAMEX> , produced at a cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$172 million</NUMEX>, paid the same
flat fee--say, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7</NUMEX> at a first-run <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> (this was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</TIMEX>, remember)--as
did fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">multiplexers</ENAMEX> interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Brothers McMullen</ENAMEX> , produced
for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a mere $25,000</NUMEX>. Such a price ceiling is downright reassuring compared to
the world of, say, print publishing--in which a newsstand browse yields
magazines ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 to $20</NUMEX> per issue. Now, micropayments for popcorn, on
the other hand, might be worth a try.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Love Fest</ENAMEX>
            

            I consider this 'zine to be
the epitome of corporate statism. This is nothing but a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>/liberal
love fest. Browsing the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Contents</ENAMEX>," I see a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dialogue</ENAMEX>" about the credibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX>; "The
Conservative Collapse," about the foundering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican Party</ENAMEX>; and
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">I Had</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coffee With Clinton</ENAMEX>," speaking glowingly about a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> visit.

            If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX> is so
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inexperienced</ENAMEX>, why has he won so many felony convictions, each closer
and closer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>? And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican Party</ENAMEX> is bereft of ideas?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> must believe that during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 60 years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> (who never met
a tax they didn't like, and want to expand the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat hole</ENAMEX> known as the welfare
state) have had new ones. The only ideas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democratic Party</ENAMEX> has are
tax-and-spend ideas!

            And these
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> "coffees"! <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> is obviously so misinformed that they
don't know (or don't care) that using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> for political
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fund-raising</ENAMEX> (not to mention using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bedroom</ENAMEX> as a motel) is against
the law! <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> is obviously a product of our foundering educational system: It
does not know or care about the law or what is right and wrong. If this is what
passes as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> culture, God help us!
