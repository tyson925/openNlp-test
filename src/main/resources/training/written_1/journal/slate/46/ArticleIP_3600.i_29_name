            I met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Kazin</ENAMEX> because
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.B. Singer</ENAMEX>. It was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, and I'd been working at the Forward for
less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Singer</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX> Prize-winning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fiction</ENAMEX>, died. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX>, the phone rang: "This is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Kazin</ENAMEX>. I'd like to
write something about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singer</ENAMEX>." If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Singer</ENAMEX> himself had been on the line, I could
hardly have been more surprised--or more delighted. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, to my mind,
inhabited a peak of the literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olympus</ENAMEX>, but I had not understood how
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">connected Singer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>-speaking world was to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kazin</ENAMEX>'s mandarin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
literary milieu. Of course, the evidence was everywhere.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A Walker</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">City</ENAMEX> , his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and best volume of autobiography, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kazin</ENAMEX> describes his first
walk across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Brooklyn Bridge</ENAMEX>, when he was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 years old</TIMEX>. He'd become
separated from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX> who were headed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Hall</ENAMEX>, but he decided to
continue across the bridge alone. In rhapsodic language reminiscent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kazin</ENAMEX> takes in all the crackling sounds and sights of the emerging <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trolleys</ENAMEX> and the crush of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and the dark roofs of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>. "Only the
electric sign of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish Daily</ENAMEX> 
               Forward , burning high over the
tenements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Side</ENAMEX>," he writes, "suddenly stilled the riot in my
heart."

            Whether
that sign stilled his heart with calming thoughts of home (where the
Forward was read in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> by his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter father</ENAMEX> and dressmaker
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX>) or whether it momentarily halted the reach of his escaping imagination
is not explained. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kazin</ENAMEX>, both were no doubt true, for he was able to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> multiple selves simultaneously. He once told me that he had considered
calling his final and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> volume of autobiography, published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, simply
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> . He opted instead for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Lifetime Burning in Every Moment</ENAMEX> , a
line taken from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.S. Eliot</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Four Quartets</ENAMEX>." "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> ," he decided, "would
be too much." But it isn't as if he chose the lines of the anti-Semite at the
expense of his own <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> impulse toward ethnic self-assertion. (He had,
after all, called his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> memoir <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX> .) When I suggested that
what he was really doing was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judaizing Eliot</ENAMEX>, making him serve as an epigraph
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kazin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> life-hungry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">odyssey</ENAMEX>, he laughed approvingly. "Yes,"
he said, "I like that."

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1942</TIMEX>, at the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 27</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kazin</ENAMEX> had published On
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Native Grounds</ENAMEX> . The grandeur of the title and the immodesty of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subtitle</ENAMEX>-- An Interpretation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern</ENAMEX> 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Prose</ENAMEX>
Literature --mark it as the sort of book only a grateful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>
could write. Who else would tune his ear so finely for traces of an emerging
national consciousness, while teasing out the finer points of its economic,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX>, and moral awareness? His open-armed embrace of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> literature, his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magisterial</ENAMEX> "we" in speaking about literary matters in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, had the
assertiveness of the newly enfranchised. Once, after I got to know him better,
he told me that his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate</ENAMEX> had moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, and I jokingly observed
that she was really on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> ground. Kazin was not amused. He had
labored too long to make America his own to feel it pulled out from under him,
even in jest.

            He never
denied the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> piece of his identity. It's just that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> was where he
felt it was possible to express all the pieces of himself at once. Kazin was
different from many <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation intellectuals</ENAMEX> who sailed into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
high culture and sent for their past only long after they had established
themselves, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> bringing over the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kazin</ENAMEX> brought
everything with him at once.

            
The story <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kazin</ENAMEX> wound up telling in the
Forward about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singer</ENAMEX> recounted the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>'s desire to see the
grave of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Wilson</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Singer</ENAMEX> was, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kazin</ENAMEX> recalled, fascinated to learn that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>, that patrician <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WASP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of letters, had chosen a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hebrew</ENAMEX> inscription for
his headstone. Kazin was clearly delighted with this confluence of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> translating himself into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singer</ENAMEX> translating himself
into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kazin</ENAMEX> himself telling the story, presiding over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both</TIMEX>,
knitting together the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> disparate elements that fueled his own unique
style.

            No wonder
Kazin was drawn to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> in A 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walker</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City</ENAMEX> .
Brownsville, the neighborhood in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> where he came from, had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> foot in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">eastern Europe</ENAMEX> and one in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kazin</ENAMEX> himself had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> foot in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brownsville</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> foot in the highbrow literary world of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>. Critics
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kazin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saul Bellow</ENAMEX>--born <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same year</TIMEX> as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kazin</ENAMEX>--stretched out their intellect and imagination across disparate worlds
and helped a generation of book-hungry immigrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> walk into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
cultural life.

            Kazin was a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> for me as well. It was his
introductions--to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Roth</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D. H. Lawrence</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry James</ENAMEX>-- that helped
me feel at home with great modernist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kazin</ENAMEX> wrote about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
literature in particular as if he had discovered it himself. He imparted to
everything he wrote that same feeling of magical discovery he describes
experiencing when he walked as a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> out of immigrant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> into
sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One day</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past winter</TIMEX>, my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and I went to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westchester</ENAMEX> also attended by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kazin</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judith</ENAMEX>. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and I had taken the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kazins</ENAMEX> offered us a ride
back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>--but only if I drove. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> told me they didn't mind
risking their own lives in the dark but that younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were another
matter. Needless to say, I was terrified, creeping along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Saw Mill Parkway</ENAMEX>
as if all of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> literature were in the back seat. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kazin</ENAMEX>'s conversational
style now closely resembled a memoir in progress--he chatted casually about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Levin</ENAMEX>, the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>, and about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clifton</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fadiman</ENAMEX>'s TV appearances, and about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singer</ENAMEX>, whom he had recently written about
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Review of Books</ENAMEX> .

            We came to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Side</ENAMEX>
Highway. There, in the distance, was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Washington Bridge</ENAMEX>, lit up in
the darkness. This was the same approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, I suddenly realized,
that I had known when I was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-ager</ENAMEX> making the drive to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Westchester</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">suburb</ENAMEX> where I grew up. Though I'd had a very different childhood
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kazin</ENAMEX> and approached <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> from a direction completely different from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kazin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brownsville</ENAMEX>, I remembered vividly the sense of possibility the drive
suggested. And I understood that it was partly because of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Kazin</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX> seemed a place of the imagination, a place where life opened up. My heart
filled with gratitude. Here was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kazin</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</TIMEX> older than I but still
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">traveling</ENAMEX> happily toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, still talking about books and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with
passion and devotion, and still holding out the promise of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX>.
