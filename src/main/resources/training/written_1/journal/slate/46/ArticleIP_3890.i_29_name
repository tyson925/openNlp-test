               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">@$#%&</ENAMEX>!!!
            

            I want to
tell you how really disappointed I was, when reading the first entry of the
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Diary</ENAMEX>" from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo Semple Jr.</ENAMEX>, to encounter a really vulgar word. To be sure, I've been
known to use that particular Anglo-Saxon expletive myself, and with great
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">verve</ENAMEX>, too; but to encounter it in the pages of 
                  Slate
                was just
too much. Don't you edit the diary submissions of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX>? Was it
absolutely necessary to use that particular word? Just because it's a diary
doesn't mean it should be published unexpurgated.

            I very much enjoy "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today</ENAMEX>'s
Papers," and I'm sorry that this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> message to you comes on the occasion
of a complaint.

            In his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 20</TIMEX> entry, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scott</ENAMEX>
Shuger suggested a contradiction between (septuplet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenny McCaughey</ENAMEX>'s
statement that "God gave us those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>" and the fact that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> were
involved and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobbi McCaughey</ENAMEX> had been hospitalized for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a month</TIMEX>.
If that's a contradiction, then no one could ever properly say, "God gave us
those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>," or even "God gave us that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>," because, as you know, there is
some human effort involved in all human births--whether from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>,
midwives, even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and, to a much lesser extent, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>.

            If you don't believe in God,
that's one thing. The alleged contradiction would therefore have nothing to do
with the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> involved or the length of stay in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>.
It would have only to do with your theological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">presupposition</ENAMEX>. But if you allow
for the possibility of a sovereign, you should not be surprised that He uses
His <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> to achieve His ends--whether in the birth of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> (or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>) or in the rearing of them.

            God is
good, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shuger</ENAMEX>. I'm looking forward to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today's Papers tomorrow</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> efforts to derail
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s appointment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Lann Lee</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s chief
civil-rights enforcer ("Payback
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>," by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Weisberg</ENAMEX>) only demonstrate what bad sports <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> have
become in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX>. If they can't have their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in the Oval
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX>, it seems, they will do anything--no matter how petty or self-serving or
just plain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stupid</ENAMEX>--to cripple the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> agenda that won <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> his office
not once, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> times in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a row</TIMEX>.

            Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orrin Hatch</ENAMEX> has to
acknowledge that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> is well qualified for the post he seeks. Yet the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX>
is trying to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX>'s nomination, complaining that he might be an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist</ENAMEX> at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hatch</ENAMEX> worries that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> would use his new position to
halt any spread of anti-affirmative-action legislation or seek to subvert
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>'s abolition of such practices.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hatch</ENAMEX>'s
campaign may play well to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX>, those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> who have always feared
that civil-rights legislation and affirmative action would somehow bring down
Western civilization. But it's obvious to the rest of us that contesting this
nomination on the basis that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> might be an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is rank
hypocrisy. If the rule <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from now</TIMEX> on is that nobody can hold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
unless they swear not to try to sway public opinion or undo existing laws, then
every congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> with a hankering to overturn <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Roe vs. Wade</ENAMEX>
might as well start looking for new employment--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hatch</ENAMEX> included.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berry Seizures</ENAMEX>--Not to Praise Them
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Krugman</ENAMEX>, in his recent
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Raspberry</ENAMEX>
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Free Trade</ENAMEX>," suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> of imports from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> with
poor working conditions are in fact being disingenuous: They don't really
oppose the bad conditions. What they oppose is the competition.

            This may be true for some.
But for me, and for many others, there is a legitimate concern about whether
we, through our purchases, are encouraging the abuse of others. And despite
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krugman</ENAMEX>'s argument, it would matter to me if I knew that the shirt I just
purchased was produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> who were beaten and tortured in order to
increase their productivity.

            It is,
unfortunately, difficult to determine reliably if the labor that went into a
particular item was handled humanely. But that doesn't mean that the issue of
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">humane</ENAMEX> treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> is unimportant. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krugman</ENAMEX> argues persuasively that
the berry-based argument is irrelevant--but the moral argument remains,
nonetheless, quite cogent.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Been Berry Berry Good to Me</ENAMEX>
            

            As a staunch supporter of
free trade, I couldn't agree more with "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Raspberry for Free</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Krugman</ENAMEX>'s critique of the arguments put forward by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> of fast track. They are not only specious, but also deeply
disingenuous.

            But supporters of free trade
should look beyond the intellectual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caliber</ENAMEX> of these arguments and consider the
political realities that sustain them. And here free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> may only have
themselves to blame.

            Sensible free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> argue
that jobs lost to free trade are more than made up for by jobs gained, and make
further, quite correct, arguments that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> trade barriers are already
quite low and that we have the most to gain by global trade liberalization.

            Still, none of the many
benefits of free trade overcome the fact that some will lose in the more
dynamic economy that aggressive free trade creates, and that the very dynamism
of free trade can cast a penumbra of insecurity that goes well beyond those who
will actually lose employment.

            The political answer to
this, which many progressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> of free trade have endorsed, is a
combination of aggressive free trade coupled with programs aimed to cushion and
compensate for the social dislocations which free trade causes. This is, in
some sense, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Democrat</ENAMEX> line, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> line, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLC</ENAMEX> line, etc.

            The
problem is that progressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> of free trade have been able to get
their free-trade agreements, but very little in the way of cushioning programs
for the kind of dynamic economic order we're clearly moving into. A
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sustainable</ENAMEX>, progressive free-trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> requires both. I don't pretend
that the politics of the situation are simple by any means. But getting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and
not the other has played a major role in creating the increasingly successful
popular backlash against free trade.
