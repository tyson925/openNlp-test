Boulogne
            

            The current installment of
the e-mail novel "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Reply All</ENAMEX>" speaks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bois de Boulogne</ENAMEX> as "north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>." With
other former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boulevard Suchet</ENAMEX>, which runs along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bois</ENAMEX>, I
have always walked west into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bois</ENAMEX>, which lies on the western edge of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.

            Please
pass this correction on to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>, along with my
appreciation for the writing that is being done in this intriguing format.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Hosenball</ENAMEX>'s dissection
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambrose Evans</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>'s brand of "journalism" ("What Ambrose
Knows") was accurate--to a point. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans-Pierce</ENAMEX>'s articles are full of
hooey, though sickeningly fascinating to read. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hosenball</ENAMEX>'s references to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dogpatch</ENAMEX>" and a place with a political culture akin to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Honduras</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haiti</ENAMEX> was beyond the pale and was just poor writing. What research determined
that our law enforcement is "corrupt and inefficient"? For a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> so critical of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans-Pierce</ENAMEX>'s bizarre stories about deep, dark <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>, how could he fall
into the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool</ENAMEX>'s trap of "snobbery or sloth" he accuses <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> of in
his writing?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>
is not a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jurassic Park</ENAMEX> of politics, law enforcement, or culture--a fact
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hosenball</ENAMEX> would be aware of if he had spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">any time</TIMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> or done
any additional research for his article. We are no more incestuous or
interconnected than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>. For a poor <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>
has a proud heritage of progressive politics running from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Majority
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe T. Robinson</ENAMEX>; to the first elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female senator</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hattie Caraway</ENAMEX>, in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>; to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senators</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. William Fulbright</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Pryor</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Bumpers</ENAMEX>;
through <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. I would trade our crime rate and our
quality of life with almost any other place in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, as would the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of émigrés we get <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>. Though we have always been poor in our
natural resources, we are rich in the quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that we produce. I
would expect a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> politics to be aware of this fact.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hosenball</ENAMEX>'s tone of unsubstantiated snobbery toward my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, though attacking
a figure I hold in humorous contempt, is itself the "journalism of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fools</ENAMEX>."

several letters mourning the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Alan Stamaty</ENAMEX>'s cartoon series
"Doodlennium":

            I just wanted to thank you
for allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Alan Stamaty</ENAMEX> a forum for his hilarious--and often
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insightful</ENAMEX>--cartoon about a (slightly) warped world. While it challenged
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Twin Peaks</ENAMEX> in obscure plot turns, it was ever entertaining, and the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> spot I'd stop at on your site. OK, OK, I get the magazine really
for the articles, but I always look at the pictures <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>.

            While I
hope there's a follow-up planned, I realize the wise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> knows when to walk
away. (While the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> is clapping for more.) Thanks again for enduring what
must have been a trying cartoon to publish.

                  Slate
                is a fine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, except for a bit of overwriting that's
become annoyingly frequent. I'm referring to "paradox," which is used wrongly
in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> separate instances in your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 13</TIMEX> issue. The word serves well in
describing the curious concept of a logical impossibility. ("This sentence is
false.") The word looks pretentious and silly, however, when it is used as a
synonym for "conflict," "irony," or "contradiction."
