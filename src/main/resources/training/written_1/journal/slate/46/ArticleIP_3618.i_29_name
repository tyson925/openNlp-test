            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of my favorite things
about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> is the way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> huddle together. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamond</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX>
are all on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th Street</ENAMEX>, between <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fifth and Sixth</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> are on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">45 th and 46 th</NUMEX> . If you want a guitar,
new or used, you need to go to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th Street</ENAMEX>. Furs are in the high 20s
off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Seventh Avenue</ENAMEX>; sewing machines are on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">West 25 th</NUMEX> . Some of these
districts are ancient, but new commercial clusters are emerging all the time.
At the moment, one of the most pleasing is a little neighborhood a few blocks
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">east</ENAMEX> of the once superfashionable neighborhood of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SoHo</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mott</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, the common thread is style--and an
approach to it that I find very appealing.

            A few
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, this neighborhood was a no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s land. Bordered on the east by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX>'s fabled skid row, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bowery</ENAMEX>, and on the south by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Little Italy</ENAMEX>, it still
has something of the flavor of a faded ethnic neighborhood, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">butchers</ENAMEX> and windowless social <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> and old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> sitting out on card chairs
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX>. But lately the tone has been set by a group of small clothing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> that share an amorphous design sensibility. What's ordinarily so
unappealing about "fashion" is its combination of snobbery, high cost, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">humorlessness</ENAMEX>. What's wonderful about these places is that they are just the
opposite: unsnooty, relatively inexpensive, and fun. Many are presided over by
recent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fashion Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parsons</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode Island</ENAMEX> schools of design who are going into business for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time.
They all have a work-in-progress, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>-project attitude. Most don't open
until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 o'clock</TIMEX>, if then, and they close whenever <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> stop coming in. On
nice <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoons</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> drop in on their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX> to say hello and examine the
goods. In several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> apologized for not having their
fall collections finished--after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Labor Day</TIMEX>. There's an <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11-p</NUMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.-at-Kinko</ENAMEX>'s
feeling to the enterprise.

            Nevertheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NoLIta</ENAMEX>, as the area is disagreeably called
(the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">abbreviation</ENAMEX> stands for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North of Little Italy</ENAMEX>), has become a style
incubator for the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, which means for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, which means
for the world. The neighborhood is a favorite scouting territory for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> for larger-scale style setters such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calvin Klein</ENAMEX>, as well as for
national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Crew</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urban Outfitters</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gap</ENAMEX>, who come to
troll for inspiration (to put it charitably). These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>, many of which have
elegant flagship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SoHo</ENAMEX>, do with clothes what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Target</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IKEA</ENAMEX> do
with furniture and household objects--they disseminate <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an affordable</NUMEX> version of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> chic to the middle class. In the new ecology of downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>,
stylistic innovation of various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinds</ENAMEX> is most likely to take place to the east
of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lafayette Street</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NoLIta</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Village</ENAMEX> or on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lower East Side</ENAMEX>.
To the west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lafayette</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SoHo</ENAMEX>, those styles are marked up and sold to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unknowing</ENAMEX>. In some cases, the mass-made interpretations are direct rip-offs
from small independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX>, who don't seem to mind. For the most part,
they take plagiarism as flattery. At this stage in their careers, the
validation they get from seeing their stylistic ideas catch on is more
important than credit or royalties.

            Part of
what's appealing about these places is that the idea of style they embody is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">holistic</ENAMEX>. All the details of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> convey an aesthetic: the lettering on
the window, the paper stock used for business cards, the lighting, the floor,
the ceiling, the display racks. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> are designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who pay
attention to how everything looks. But they manage to do so, in the main,
without seeming precious or prissy about it.
