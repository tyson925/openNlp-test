               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cotton Club</ENAMEX> ,
produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhea & Kaiser Marketing Communications</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc</ENAMEX>.

            Guess what takes center
stage in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cotton Club</ENAMEX> . A ... er ... <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton plant</ENAMEX>, to
be precise, and a sassy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at that. No moldy bolls sprouting wispy white
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nothings</ENAMEX> here: This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> is lissome. It is lush. And it will go to great
lengths to convince its target market--the rural <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>--to buy "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Finish</ENAMEX>." A
"defoliant, re-growth inhibitor, and boll opener," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finish</ENAMEX> is produced by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc</ENAMEX>. It speeds up the harvest by accelerating the growth cycle of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cotton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, causing it to age, lose its leaves, and open bolls ahead of
schedule. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cotton Club</ENAMEX> dramatizes that compressed cycle via the
sashaying, shimmying <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, which sheds its inhibitions--and its leaves--in its
commitment to commerce, and bares all.

            Not that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Cotton</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club</ENAMEX> is in poor taste, you understand. It is true that it is set to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">David</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX>'s famous "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stripper</ENAMEX>," which urges <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to "take it off, take it all
off"--but the spot's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhea & Kaiser</ENAMEX>, were sharply
aware of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cotton Belt-Bible Belt</ENAMEX> overlap. "This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX>, not a
stripper," one of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> insists.

            The setting, however,
strikes a coyly sultry note. Red curtains and exaggerated underlighting
transform an old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> opera <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, into "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cotton Club</ENAMEX>,"
where "a new act" is being staged. "First," says the voice-over, as the camera
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curves</ENAMEX> around a gyrating graphic, "it takes off those leaves. Then, it keeps
them from coming back." We aren't sure what "it" is, but clearly, this product
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">aids aging</ENAMEX>. Leaves wither and fall as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> continues to dance--the
combination of potent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strip clubs</ENAMEX> isn't likely to endear itself
to the PC <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>; and there are those who would be hard pressed to distinguish
between Finish and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Agent Orange</ENAMEX>. But all's well, etc., because the stuff in the
white bottle opens those bolls--"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Man</ENAMEX> , does it open up those bolls."

            To put it another way, the
plant takes it all off, then sprouts bolls. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hmm</ENAMEX>.

            A bottle of Finish waits in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wings</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chyron</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> describe its "virtues." Not only does it
defoliate, inhibit re-growth, and open bolls, but it is also "faster and more
consistent than any other harvest aid." As the curtain closes and applause
spills across the footlights, the message is reiterated: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cotton</ENAMEX> has never
moved like this"--as swiftly to harvest, or across a stage.
