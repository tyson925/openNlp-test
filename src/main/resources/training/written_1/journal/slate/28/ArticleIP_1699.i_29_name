            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian</ENAMEX> reported on its front page that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> tried to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recruit Britain</ENAMEX>'s best-known spin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> to help him in his present troubles.
It said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> sought out <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair</ENAMEX>'s aggressive chief press
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">spokesman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alastair Campbell</ENAMEX>, after watching him in action on the prime
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX>'s trips to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. "He dropped him a note suggesting a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transatlantic</ENAMEX> swap," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> said. "The tone of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s note was
bantering but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Downing</ENAMEX> Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> are adamant the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> was putting
out feelers with a view to poaching Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campbell</ENAMEX> and that the idea ... was
given serious consideration." But, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> said, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> had decided, in the
words of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Downing Street</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, "to stay with his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tony</ENAMEX>."

            Also
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Independent of London</ENAMEX> reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney Blumenthal</ENAMEX>'s claims (in
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> testimony) that he looked after relations between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX>
"have not earned him many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> on either side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>," because
"[t]here are plenty of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassadors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> for instance, who think they handle that relationship, and regard
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenthal</ENAMEX> as a nuisance."

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunanda Datta-Ray</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statesman of Calcutta</ENAMEX> and now an editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Straits Times of Singapore</ENAMEX>, wrote in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian Age</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> fear the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> scandal will "set back their own promised freedom of information bill."
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, he said, "the most innocent trivia provokes official <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">paranoia</ENAMEX> about
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smear</ENAMEX> and blackmail are widespread political <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, and "a
free flow of information could reduce scope for blackmail," he added.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto Globe</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mail</ENAMEX> ran an op-ed piece by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harper</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magazine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John R. MacArthur</ENAMEX>, excoriating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howell Raines</ENAMEX>, the editorial page
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , for setting "some kind of record for
sanctimonious nonsense" in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>'s comments on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flytrap</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamenting</ENAMEX> "the near
total erosion of the distinction between the upmarket <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dailies</ENAMEX> and their tabloid
print and television inferiors," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MacArthur</ENAMEX> attacked both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> for persisting in a "self-righteous persecution of
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and defence of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice-squad</ENAMEX> techniques."

            
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> election result was widely
welcomed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> and abroad for its crushing defeat of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pauline Hanson</ENAMEX> and
her racist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">One Nation Party</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sydney Morning Herald</ENAMEX> said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s re-elected
conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Howard "</ENAMEX>must virtually remake himself" and "be
entirely more sophisticated in grappling with the changing nature of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>." Under the headline "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advance Australia Fair</ENAMEX>," the Straits Times of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> said that "the results of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>'s general election bear testimony
to the resilience of its national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>."

            The
meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group of Seven</ENAMEX> largest industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> was
criticized in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial</ENAMEX>
Times of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> for its failure to come up with a detailed plan on the
world financial crisis. The summit did not mark "the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">finest hour of</TIMEX>
international economic diplomacy," an editorial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> said. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX>
"must report back with a plan as soon as possible, and certainly before the end
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>": The next scheduled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G7</TIMEX> meeting (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next spring</TIMEX>) is too far away. The
Times of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> said
that the pauperization of various <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> "is belatedly being
recognised as a ticking time bomb which may explode, plunging the region into
acute political and social chaos," and it criticized conservative policies for
dealing with this. There are "serious questions as to whether this epidemic
ought to be treated as a global crisis, or on the basis of each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> trying
to protect itself even at the cost of others."

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Izvestiya</ENAMEX> said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s
latest anti-crisis program will return <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> to the economy of the early
1990s, which was controlled by certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and was very unjust.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sevodnya</ENAMEX> called the program "a weird cross between <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX>-style
socialism and an inflationary plan" that would result in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> becoming "a
very <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> and boring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Komsomolskaya Pravda</ENAMEX> quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yury Luzhkov</ENAMEX> as saying,
in reply to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX>'s question about what he would do to prevent
starvation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>, "I will eat less."

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South China Morning Post</ENAMEX> carried a
report <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> are the lowest paid
of all business chain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. On average, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> gets <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15.10 HK</NUMEX>
per hour, compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$17.80 HK</NUMEX> for a "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>value" <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6 HK</NUMEX> for each
Snoopy toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX> sells. A trade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unionist member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>
government's labor affairs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> has proposed a minimum <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</TIMEX> wage in the
territory of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$35 HK</NUMEX>.
