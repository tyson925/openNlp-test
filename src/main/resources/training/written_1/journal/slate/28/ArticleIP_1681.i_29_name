            The collapse of the tobacco
deal (Issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), rumblings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> reform (Issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), and an end to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ireland</ENAMEX>'s "troubles" (Issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) push <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tailgate</ENAMEX> to the fringe of the marquee.

            Who
derailed the tobacco deal? It was "gold rush, mob psychology" among greedy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>, argues <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Gigot</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NewsHour With Jim Lehrer</ENAMEX> ). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> were so entranced by pots of money that they lost their heads and
neglected to offer the tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> something in return (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gigot</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evan Thomas</ENAMEX>,
Inside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> ). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gigot</ENAMEX> also accuses prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dems</ENAMEX>--like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Waxman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX>,--of derailing the bill in
hopes of creating a campaign issue with which to truncheon the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Roberts</ENAMEX> reports that the tobacco agreement is being
marketed as a protect-the-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> bill (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Washington Week in Review</ENAMEX> ).
This strikes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Krauthammer</ENAMEX> ( Inside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> ) as disgustingly
hypocritical, because the original deal--accepted by the tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEOs</ENAMEX>--contains
the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">underage smoking</ENAMEX> preventive measures as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>'s. That is,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avarice</ENAMEX>--not a desire to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>--is firmly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>'s seat.

            But the
tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> are political untouchables, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentariat</ENAMEX> agrees. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tobacco CEOs</ENAMEX>
can't even buy congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>--an unprecedented spectacle that astounds
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cokie Roberts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">This Week</ENAMEX> ). Perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> can unilaterally
implement the derailed provisions, hope a few (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nina Totenberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Germond</ENAMEX>,
Inside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Hunt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Capital Gang</ENAMEX> ). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disagrees</ENAMEX>, arguing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> will ixnay cigarette advertising
restrictions on <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> grounds.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blankley</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Late Edition</ENAMEX> ),
joined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Novak</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Capital Gang</ENAMEX> ), dubs the hounding and
vilification of legal business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprises</ENAMEX> an "ugly moment." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krauthammer</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Kristol</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">This Week</ENAMEX> ) are virtually alone in worrying about the
distributional consequences of a sin tax (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristol</ENAMEX> endorses middle-class tax
cuts as offsets).

            The
commentariat marvels that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> are willing to discuss Issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
Security reforms, at all. (On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> shows considering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX>, a panel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> mentions that the issue was formerly the "<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> rail
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> politics.") <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is broaching the issue, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Page</ENAMEX>
( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Late Edition</ENAMEX> ), because he wants history to remember him as something
other than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prez</ENAMEX> who coupled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> is wary of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> who want to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> about
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>, warns <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Shields</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NewsHour</ENAMEX> ). Only <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> can
safely approach the issue--it is like "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX> going to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>," he says.
If the stock market crashes, the calls for privatization will simmer down, say
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shields</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Roberts</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Stephanopoulos</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">This Week</ENAMEX> ). Everyone
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">praises Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> for his role in Issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>--the breakthrough agreement in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX>. Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>-hater <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristol respects Clinton</ENAMEX>'s accomplishment,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gleefully</ENAMEX> suggesting that after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is hounded out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> for witness
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tampering</ENAMEX> and obstruction of justice, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> should name him a
peripatetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiator</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX>, the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> leader
who mediated the negotiations, receives greater acclaim: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Nobel Peace Prize</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committee</ENAMEX> can take a vacation," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunt</ENAMEX>. "It goes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitchell</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX> just proves that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Only Superpower</ENAMEX> must
intervene more frequently, say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristol</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Roberts</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Will</ENAMEX> ( This
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Week</TIMEX> ). A few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> stress potential pitfalls along the road to peace. The
"leverage of the ruthless is considerable," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX>.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commentariat</ENAMEX> has nothing new to say about Issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s ongoing
legal battles. Everyone wonders what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> will do. Everyone wonders how
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> will react.

            

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Commentariat Would Like a Nonsmoking</ENAMEX>
Table, Please: Most polls agree that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a quarter</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> adult
population smokes regularly. It's interesting to note that of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX>
who held forth on tobacco legislation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX>, only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Germond</ENAMEX> professes
to currently being a smoker. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germond</ENAMEX> is happy to shell out an extra sawbuck per
pack if only it'll keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> from getting hooked.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">will Clinton</ENAMEX>'s legacy be? Could it be peace in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wonders Margaret</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlson</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Capital Gang</ENAMEX> ). How about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> reform? asks
