               Quilters , produced
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.J. Sedelmaier Productions Inc.</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quilted Northern Tissue</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quilters</ENAMEX> would have
you believe that bathroom tissue is more than trash in the making. Produced by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.J. Sedelmaier</ENAMEX>, who adapted the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japanimation</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Speed Racer</ENAMEX> to sell a new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagen</ENAMEX>, it uses a reliable formula to good effect. It draws on the
familiar--in this case, the film <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">How to Make an American Quilt --and</ENAMEX>
renders it different. Needless to say, success, in such cases, hinges on the ad
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX>'s ability to manipulate that fine line between the familiar and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clich√©d</ENAMEX>: It's all in the adaptation.

            Released in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, How to
Make an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Quilt</ENAMEX> drew a largely female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>. Some of the film's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leitmotifs</ENAMEX>--tradition as clarifier and stabilizer, a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>--resurface in this spot, which promotes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quilted Northern Tissue</ENAMEX>. The
animation soft, the music folksy, we are introduced to the "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quilted Northern</ENAMEX>
Quilters," a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> creating handmade paper. It's an engaging image, if
an unlikely one. And though it isn't clear why the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> use knitting needles
to quilt, the explicitly artificial setting makes the sale. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Animation</ENAMEX>, which
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lets mice</ENAMEX> sing and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX> be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>, saves the spot from ridiculing its own
message.

            It's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first day</TIMEX> for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quilting</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s newest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">entrant</ENAMEX>, but her integration is seamless, the bonding
instant. The older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX> in a pod but for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">multi-culti-</ENAMEX>mandated difference of skin color--are quick to reassure the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novice</ENAMEX>. "Don't worry, doll," says the black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>. "Just keep quilting."
Because that, adds the white one, is what makes the sheets "so absorbent." Fie
on those of you who think quilted bathroom tissue is all about aesthetics: It's
utility , stupid. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quilters</ENAMEX> is a model exercise in branding, that
Holy Grail of our times. Be it of dubious value, the extra element--"quilting"
in this case--is designed to convince the consumer that paying more gets them
more. The spot plays to a couple of postindustrial truisms: that proof of human
workmanship qualifies as more; and that more is better. (Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternative</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quilters</ENAMEX> reminds you, the music slowing to an ominous clank, is one of
"those flat-as<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-a-pancake</ENAMEX> sheets made down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>.") And it plays to the
germ pathology that sustains the market for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-bacteriants</ENAMEX> and
investigative-report segments titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Does Your Housecleaning Agent</ENAMEX>
Really <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Protect Your Infant From the Salmonella That Will Turn His</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Insides Into an Oozing Green Swamp</ENAMEX>? Think Again ." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quilted Northern</ENAMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quilted</ENAMEX> to create "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of places for moisture to go," we're told, the
animation now reminiscent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1950s</ENAMEX> spots that showed how a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pill</ENAMEX> absorbed
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stomach acid</ENAMEX>. "And all that absorbency leaves you feeling cle-ean."

            It's time for the happy
ending: "Nice job, dear." And for the final pitch: the brand name and a gentle
reminder that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quilted Northern</ENAMEX> is "quilted to absorb." The more effective
because it is so simple, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quilters</ENAMEX> ends up confirming what the burgeoning
market would deny: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Less</ENAMEX> is, in fact, more.
