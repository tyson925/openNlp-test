               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA Rule</ENAMEX> , produced
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Brian Smith</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith & Harroff Inc.</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tobacco-Free Kids</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rule</ENAMEX> takes a leaf
out of the tobacco industry's pouch: It targets <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. Capitalizing on a truth
that has long stabilized cigarette marketing and sales--namely, that if you're
going to hook new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>, you have to catch 'em young--it is one of several
spots, some more controversial than others, that attack smoking. And while
there is no concrete proof that anti-smoking advertising reduces the number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, which has taken an especially aggressive ad
approach, claim a sharp dip. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> have
pledged to spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$53 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX>tobacco advertising. That might
seem like pennies compared with the tobacco industry's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5 billion</NUMEX> in annual
profits, but other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are joining the burgeoning bandwagon as well.

            Structured like a classic
political negative, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> Rule first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opposition</ENAMEX>'s claim, then
attacks it: "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tobacco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> say they don't target <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>" ... and then,
to staccato music and pulsing visuals, "but the facts tell a different story."
The female narrative voice serves a different purpose here than in traditional
political campaigns, where it is sometimes used to soften negative spots. Here,
it only compounds the menace. The context gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> an implied stake in
the issue: She could, the spot seems to say, be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>.

            The "facts" the tobacco
industry avoids are laid out in snappy succession: A neon-lit night scene
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> around a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marlboro</ENAMEX> hoarding; a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Camel</ENAMEX> poster inviting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> to
"go ahead," assuring them that "it's on me"; shots of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> drawn to
"eye-level displays" and "promotions that clearly appeal to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>." A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> looks
into a cigarette-vending machine; a toy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is plastered with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> brand
names; a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newport</ENAMEX> poster equates smoking with freshness and the outdoors; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX>
Camel flaunts his sax. The speed and number of the images--blink once, and
you'll miss <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>--make tobacco marketing seem demonic, all-pervasive.

            The rush settles briefly,
with a slow shot of a hand manipulating a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marlboro</ENAMEX> race <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. The hand is that
of a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, and the message--that he will learn ... and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">smoke</ENAMEX>--is made
more explicit. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chyron</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> tell us that "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> will start smoking
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>." The figure touted here would have required third-party verification in
a political-campaign spot; it is easily accepted in a spot that takes on an
industry that has long been banned from running ads on television.

            The spot shifts to a
fresh-faced blond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-ager</ENAMEX> lighting up in what appears to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. Whatever
the actual demographic of the teen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smoker</ENAMEX>--if there be one-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA Rule</ENAMEX> is
pitched at the most powerful voting bloc in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> politics: the white middle
class. No black leather and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> here--these are ubiquitous white-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>,
who will nonetheless drop like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> because of "their addiction." Flash
effects and double exposures reinforce cause and effect--promotions and
displays and vending machines equal teen-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> deaths a day.
The corollary: Protecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> from "tobacco marketing and sales" (by
supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> rules the spot is promoting) will
protect them from the noxious <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weed</ENAMEX> itself.

            The closing scene strikes a
match to the cause: "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tobacco</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America</ENAMEX> draws the line." There's a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissonant</ENAMEX> note here, however: Throughout the spot, our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>, the last one
seen in satisfied profile, seem to be enjoying their smoke. A testament to the
addictive power of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX>, you say? Be that as it may, a tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that
dared to make an unabashed link between cigarettes and pleasure would have had
the book thrown at them.

            Anti-smoking advertising is
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> in the fight against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX>: A proposed settlement being
worked on by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> cigarette <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> and government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> will require that the
tobacco industry <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) fund smoking-cessation programs for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
commit to reducing teen smoking by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next seven years</TIMEX>,
failing which it will pay huge penalties; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) drastically curtail advertising;
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) fund "countermarketing" programs. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier today</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Trade</ENAMEX>
Commission announced that it will charge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.</ENAMEX> with unfair
advertising practices, alleging that its <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Camel</ENAMEX> campaign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets children</ENAMEX>.
(See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSNBC</ENAMEX> for
the full story.) While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA Rule</ENAMEX> is nowhere near as dramatic as other
spots of its ilk (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> shows a tobacco junkie smoking through a hole in her
neck; another, a teen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smoker</ENAMEX>'s face putrefying, shedding <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX>, as she brushes
her teeth; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlboro Man Wayne McLaren</ENAMEX> dying of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>), it makes
its point: Hook one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> early with promotions, and peer pressure will do the
rest.
