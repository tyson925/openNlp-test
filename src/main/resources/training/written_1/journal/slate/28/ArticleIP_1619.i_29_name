               Take <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Stand</ENAMEX> ,
produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trippi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McMahon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Squier</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit Union</ENAMEX> Campaign for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consumer Choice</ENAMEX>.

            Increasingly, political
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> are moving from pushing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> to pushing issues, a change that
is unlikely to meet with universal approbation. Take <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Stand</ENAMEX> is the
creation of political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve McMahon</ENAMEX> on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">credit unions</ENAMEX>. At
issue is legislation that would undermine the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>' federally
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">endorsed/guaranteed/</ENAMEX>protected competitive advantage over conventional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>.

            The spot uses a tactic
common among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> who don't want to take the in-your-face-negative route.
Its strategy is "comparative": <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Affirmation</ENAMEX> moves seamlessly into attack; the
positive sets up the negative.

            The message is explicit from
the get-go: "Big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>" are bad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, the high-cost alternative you don't need
to settle for. The option, already availed of by "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>" just
like you, is ... the credit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>. The initial visuals are fuzzy and sweet, and
ring newish variations on familiar themes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, companionship
and security. Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> gathered around the table in this <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ozzie and</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harriet</ENAMEX> update is stolidly suburban, it comprises <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asians</ENAMEX>; though the spot
proffers a squishily trite bedtime-story shot, it does so with an explicit nod
to the minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, an implicit nod to the minority <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>.

            With their "low rate loans,"
credit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> let the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> bite off their bit of the dream, be it
new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wheels</ENAMEX>, new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">digs</ENAMEX>, or a college degree. The spot serves up a sanitized,
sitcom version of the grand melting pot; the images of diversity are carefully
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calibrated</ENAMEX>, almost disingenuously casual. We've seen the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> clustered
around <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX>, and we've seen the black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> reading to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. We also get
the picnicking towheads, the strolling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seniors</ENAMEX>, the black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX>.

            Now the nub: the entirely
credible complaint that big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> levy higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX> fees. Focus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have
identified this as a pet consumer peeve, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Take A Stand</ENAMEX> urges <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX>
to do just that. The visual limns an urban skyline, superimposing a sinister
message--"Now the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> want to take away your right to join a credit
union"--over an unsourced headline: "Tell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> to back off." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chyron</ENAMEX> and
narrative alike tap the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eons-old</TIMEX>, morally loaded distinction between concrete
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jungle</ENAMEX> (home to "the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">malefactors</ENAMEX> of great wealth," as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodore Roosevelt</ENAMEX> dubbed
monster <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Walden wood</ENAMEX> (or its '90s version, the manicured
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">burbs</ENAMEX>). And you're given an <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">800</ENAMEX> number, which is left on-screen through the
succeeding scenes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sponsors</ENAMEX> of the spot really want you to make that
call--after which you'll be patched through to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>, your name added to a petition, and so on. After all, there are
several issue-advocacy techniques designed to show <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> your
"grassroots support."

            The end is even sweeter, and
pairs clasped hands: the grown-up hand and the kiddie hand; the black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hand</ENAMEX> and
the white hand, and so on. So what if the narrative is a tad cluttered by all
the calls to action? It's to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve McMahon</ENAMEX>'s credit that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Take A Stand</ENAMEX> 's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populism</ENAMEX> is entirely palatable. The proof of its success, however, may well lie
in the length of that petition.
