            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
apology-strewn tour of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> is Issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>: He's sorry about slavery; he's sorry
about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rwanda</ENAMEX> massacre. And the schoolyard murder in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jonesboro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ark.</ENAMEX>, Issue
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, bumps the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s sex scandal to Issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deborah</ENAMEX>
Mathis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Germond</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nina Totenberg</ENAMEX> ( Inside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> ), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brit Hume</ENAMEX>
( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox News Sunday</ENAMEX> ) detect hollowness in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s teary expiation for
international silence on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rwanda</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> was aware of the genocide,
says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hume</ENAMEX>, and there is no indication that it would act differently <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
Perhaps the apology tour was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s way of manufacturing "moral parity" with
the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Mandela</ENAMEX>, muses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hume</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">right-wing pundits</ENAMEX> are incensed by the "most expansive
and extensive groveling and pandering" ever exhibited by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchanan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The McLaughlin Group</ENAMEX> ). Noting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sudanese</ENAMEX> routinely sell
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> into slavery, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchanan</ENAMEX> sees no need to offer apologies to "those
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> over there." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Novak</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Capital Gang</ENAMEX> ) is appalled at the
"contrition mission," finding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s slavery apologies logically flawed in
light of the many prominent "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, in business, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">athletics</ENAMEX>, in show business," who would not be <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> without the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX>. Capital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gang sters</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Carlson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Hunt</ENAMEX>--both appalled by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novak</ENAMEX>--are joined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.J. Dionne</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Meet the Press</ENAMEX> ) in arguing that,
in fact, slavery is wrong, ergo it's fine for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> to say
so.

            A mudslide
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> construes the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> Tour as political homage to black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>, a cornerstone of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s electoral <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">base</ENAMEX>. But that doesn't open
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> to charges of pandering, notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Shields</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NewsHour With Jim</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehrer</ENAMEX> ), because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> of all stripes--from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> to mayors
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>--routinely visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Three I</ENAMEX>'s (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>) to
mollify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX>. If anything, say the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is shrewd to solidify
political support during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these dark days</TIMEX>.

            
Beleaguered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaughlin</ENAMEX> liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eleanor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clift</ENAMEX>--joined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Roberts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Late Edition</ENAMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Gergen</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Carney</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The McLaughlin Group</ENAMEX> )--stresses the tour's salutary
importance in improving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX> trade connections. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clift</ENAMEX> predicts that in
50 years <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> will conduct a thriving trade with a prosperous <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commentariat</ENAMEX> is saddened by Issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, the senseless killings of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> angry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youths</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germond</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blankley</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Late</ENAMEX>
Edition ) warn against drawing too many lessons from an isolated, senseless
episode of evil, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Kristol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">This Week</ENAMEX> ) cautions all against
compounding the crime by "committing sociology," i.e., relieving the two
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child-shooters</ENAMEX> of moral responsibility for their evildoing. But most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX>
shrug off this advice and blame the incident on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) lax gun-control laws; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) our
violent, permissive popular culture; or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3</NUMEX>) the popular choice: both.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s sex scandal dips to Issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paula Jones</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> are outraged that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
Willey-related letters lickety-split in the wake of her <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">60 Minutes</ENAMEX>
interview but released <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> in response to an earlier subpoena. The
commentariat repeats its long-held opinion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s claim of executive
privilege is bunk. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristol</ENAMEX> opines that "it's worth being a little bit outraged"
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s cynical tactics, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Gigot</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NewsHour</ENAMEX> ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shields</ENAMEX>
stress that the public does not share his outrage. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> elicits a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bronx</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cheer</ENAMEX> from several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> for admitting no knowledge of whether or not his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> have invoked executive privilege (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> must sign all such
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">claims</ENAMEX>).

            Most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX> are mystified by Issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX>'s unexpected putsch. Clift
suggests that he wanted to install a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> with all the "charisma of a tree
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stump</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carney</ENAMEX> thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX> was feeling ignored and did this partly as a
publicity stunt. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX> is crazy like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fox</ENAMEX>; others
think he's just crazy or possibly boozed out of his mind.

            

               It's OK, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leo Strauss Was a Devoted</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gambler</ENAMEX>: Someone should slip <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX> a tape of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>'s This
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Week</TIMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristol</ENAMEX> admits to being eliminated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCAA</ENAMEX> pool.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pundit Central</ENAMEX> is shocked-- shocked! --to learn there is gambling at the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard</ENAMEX> .
