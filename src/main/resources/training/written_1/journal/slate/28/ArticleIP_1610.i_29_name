               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mischief</ENAMEX> , produced
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Shipman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy & Mather Inc.</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>.

            Music makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mischief</ENAMEX> ,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy & Mather</ENAMEX> spot that introduces the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">XJ6</ENAMEX>. Pointedly
abandoning the formulaic, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this 30-second</TIMEX> spot dispenses with such staples as
the narrative voice, choosing to rely on the soundtrack to present its subject
as polyphonic, versatile.

            "We had to tell a story
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman Foote</ENAMEX>, creative
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Foote Communications Ltd.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>, which composed the music
and designed the sound for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mischief</ENAMEX> , counts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMW</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocean Spray</ENAMEX>
among its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. This ad was especially challenging. "There is no voice-over,
so the music has to be the emotional voice for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>." The copy is spare,
and distills to a few simple lines: "It has its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s eyes ... its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s
stature ... and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>'s appetite for mischief." The message is simple,
bound to appeal to high-end <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> weighing their options: No trade-offs
necessary.

            A female voice, sinuous,
wordless, oddly comforting; the thrum of reverse guitars and synthesizer pads;
and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> set of images: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> headlights, then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>. Panels aglow; pedigree
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unimpeachable</ENAMEX>. Long-range shots of the classic hood ornament, and of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in
profile--the stately rhythms hold. Close-ups of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>, crouched, feral, and
of a glinting hubcap--the beat quickens. Distorted lo-fi drum loops and a blues
guitar, the promise of trouble. This spot isn't about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> picnics in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bee</ENAMEX>-loud glades. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Night</ENAMEX> has fallen, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mischief</ENAMEX> opts for flinty grays
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>-slickness and palpable sexuality of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cronenberg</ENAMEX>'s
Crash and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Verhoeven's Basic Instinct</ENAMEX> . Clever camera work tilts
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asphalt</ENAMEX>, giving the spot some depth and visual interest. And through it
all, the music: rounded plops, stretchy roars, sibilant hisses. As the car zips
away, picking up speed till the tail lights are pinpoints in the distance, a
single line of text reinforces the point. This is a "new breed of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>." You
can smell the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather</ENAMEX> and feel the sweat: The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">XJ6</NUMEX> may be a classic, but make no
mistake--it is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beast</ENAMEX> of the future.
