               Shoes , produced by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Semans</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Semans Co.</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Rights Campaign</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen DeGeneres</ENAMEX> just came
out as a lesbian on the cover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> , and she's doing it on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> episode of her hit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> sitcom, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen</ENAMEX> . Her exit from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">closet</ENAMEX> is a milestone: No other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> has stepped out of it at the height of his
or her career. While there are currently <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two dozen</NUMEX> gay or lesbian
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regulars</ENAMEX> in prime-time shows, according to the gay and lesbian magazine the
Advocate , none plays the lead. And no series has commanded such advance
attention for a nonfarewell episode since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> ' revelation of who shot
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JR.</ENAMEX>

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Rights Campaign</ENAMEX>, the largest gay
and lesbian political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, plans <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, complete with party kits, to celebrate the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>'s
acknowledgment that she is gay. It has also chosen the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 30</TIMEX> show to air
Shoes , a spot that attacks job discrimination on the basis of sexual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX>. Produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Semans</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Semans Co.</ENAMEX>, which specializes in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">public-service</ENAMEX> and progressive-issue campaigns, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shoes</ENAMEX> was rejected by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen</ENAMEX> 's parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. Citing a "no controversial-issue
advertising" policy, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> turned down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRC</ENAMEX>'s request that it make a single
nationwide purchase of air time. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Sixty-five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">affiliates</ENAMEX> have agreed to air the
spot, however, and it will be placed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> markets around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.

            
               Shoes chooses a
single focus--discrimination in the workplace--and casts it in mainstream
terms. Never explicitly seeking approval of a lifestyle, it follows a tested
civil-rights-protest strategy: Show the injustice, then appeal to the public's
sense of fairness.

            Opening with a female
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">silhouette</ENAMEX> walking away from a punitive "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>" sign, it follows her
unsteady progress down a flight of stairs and uses a staccato colloquy between
her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> to dramatize the injustice:

            "They fired her? ... That
isn't fair."

            "No, it isn't."

            "It isn't legal."

            "Yes, it is."

            Our first assumption is that
this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> of gender-based discrimination--but we're stopped short
by the announcement that "it" is legal. Job discrimination against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>?
Surely not. Building on an already secure national consensus on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s rights,
the dialogue draws on basic, inarguable values while the visuals emphasize the
sheer normalcy of it all: the ubiquitous setting, the ubiquitous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>, the
ubiquitous iniquity. Nothing weird here--instead, a shot of a plaque that once
acknowledged this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>'s "sustained superior performance" and must now be
packed away.

            It is at the moment of
maximum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> susceptibility that we hear, for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">woman</ENAMEX> was fired not because of her gender but because of her sexual preference.
Confounding our initial assumption, the spot prompts us to question why this
kind of discrimination is accepted--even legal in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, a fact the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">narrator</ENAMEX> tells us "most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> don't know." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semans</ENAMEX> says she wrote that line
into the narrative after she had told a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, including her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>,
about the spot. "They all said there must be a law against that," she says.
There isn't, even though polling for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRC</ENAMEX> (jointly conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrat</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Celinda Lake</ENAMEX> and the conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarrance Group</ENAMEX>) shows that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>
percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX> should have "equal rights in terms of
job opportunities." <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Sixty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">eight percent</NUMEX> favor a federal law to "prevent job
discrimination against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lesbians</ENAMEX>."

            The bleak black and white of
the scene in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> is relieved by a shot of yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>,
visible through the window. "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">storyboards</ENAMEX> had that from the start," Semans
says. "Visually we wanted to create a little bit of hope, a transition to the
rest of the spot" and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRC</ENAMEX> logo, which picks up and repeats the color.

            Its lesbian/bisexual (we're
never told which) female subject allows Shoes to tap wider contexts of
discrimination: A male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protagonist</ENAMEX> wouldn't have had her access to the history
of discrimination in the work place; and an infusion of color (read: race)
might have narrowed the canvas, making the problem seem less pervasive than it
is.

            Emphasizing the breadth of
such discrimination with its choice of a subject, the spot then personalizes
her. She is more than an abstract cause, a dry phrase like "sexual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX>." She has a name: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty</ENAMEX>. And she is liked by her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, who
ask if there is anything they can do to help. There is, the narrator answers as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRC</ENAMEX> logo (a yellow equal sign, re-emphasizing how mainstream this cause is)
appears on-screen: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Call the Human Rights Campaign</ENAMEX>, toll free.

            As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty</ENAMEX> leaves the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> echoes one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s best received and most carefully
polled calls--for "solutions that bring us together." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> is
supporting the anti-gay-job-discrimination bill, and this spot kicks off a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> campaign to pass it. It's smart politics, because the narrow focus
goes with the flow of public opinion.

            Is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s
rejection of Shoes ironic given that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen</ENAMEX>'s release from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">closet</ENAMEX> is
likely to raise the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>'s ratings in the crucial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> sweeps? Not really. It
vacillated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> before going with the show's proposal; it also recently
turned down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another</NUMEX> ad request by a cruise line that targets <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lesbians</ENAMEX>, on the
grounds that "discussion about same-sex lifestyles is more appropriate in
programming" (where it will probably be sanitized). You'd think that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> and
some of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">affiliates</ENAMEX> would grow up, now that they've let <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen</ENAMEX> out. Truth in
programming is, however, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step.
