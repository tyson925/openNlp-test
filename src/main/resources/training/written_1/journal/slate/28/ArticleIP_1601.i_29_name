               That's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">My Boy</ENAMEX> ,
produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adult Tylenol</ENAMEX>.

            The strategy animating
That's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">My Boy</ENAMEX> , produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adult</ENAMEX>
Tylenol, is simple: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Capitalize</ENAMEX> on the clichéd but timely football motif to
appeal directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Super Bowl</ENAMEX>
broadcast. At the same time, reach out to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>--who buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX> and stock
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX>--by cleverly deconstructing the macho stereotype so that
it becomes familiar, funny.

            The idea seems to have
worked: The ad emerged as one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Super Bowl</ENAMEX> broadcast's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> most successful,
according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people meter</ENAMEX>, a hand-held dial that registered
the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">second-by-second</TIMEX> reaction of a sample of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">139</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>. And it fared
particularly well with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, who placed it in the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>.

            The spot opens with an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">overweight father</ENAMEX> clearly looking to realize his old dreams vicariously through
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dad</ENAMEX> knows that the key to success lies in the early start he did not
get, that only the savvy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fledgling</ENAMEX> gets the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX>. So he's willing to go to bat
for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Now</ENAMEX>, we got a lot of work to do before the next game," he tells
the perfectly--and expensively--attired aspirant. "But I'm with you." His
support, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>'s almost weary "OK, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX>" suggests, is a dubious privilege.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> scene shows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX>
holding the ball for a place kick. The setting, complete with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Rockwell</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">backyard</ENAMEX> and white picket fence, is perfect. It invites nostalgia, stirs
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">memories</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet or</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parents</ENAMEX> born a
generation later, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Partridge Family</ENAMEX> , when ... ouch ! Junior's
mighty kick makes sharp contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX>'s foot.

            Undaunted, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">self-appointed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> keeps his post, showing his charge how to throw the ball,
then going out for a pass. "I'm open," he yells. Sure he is--there's no one
else on the field. But wait--here's a hedge, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scourge</ENAMEX> of the
less-than-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX>-of<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-foot</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Awkward</ENAMEX>, klutzy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> trips. As before, it's the father
who's been hurt, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> who expresses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dad</ENAMEX>, you OK<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>" The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s
response ("Yeah, fine," when he's clearly not) and the next <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> scenes (a
flurry of action, then a shot of him flat on his face) suddenly clarify the
spot's real target. It's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, of course, who, seeing her own frustrated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sportsman</ENAMEX> in the prone figure on the field, smiles as she turns up the dial on
the ad <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">meter</NUMEX>. She knows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> will try something he shouldn't, that he will
stub his toe, that he will complain, and that she will have to give him
something to stop the pain.

            The rout continues, a
blind-side tackle eliciting a wheezy "Nice tackle, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>," followed by a close-up
of the clearly pumped-up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duo</ENAMEX> runs toward us, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad puffing</ENAMEX>,
struggling to keep up, then finally gesturing for a timeout. We get a
commercial break within the commercial, the voice-over telling us that "the
best moments in life sometimes come with a few aches and pains." A shot of the
Tylenol box and a glass of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> accompanies the first mention of the product.
The contrast with past <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tylenol</ENAMEX> ads is striking. No pain-wracked
headache sufferers here. No irradiative blue waves pulsating to pounding music.
This is a happy ad for a pain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reliever</ENAMEX> so effective that, as we see in the next
scenes, it can help you smile through a broken arm.

            And for all the kidding he's
taken, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> gets his payoff. The scene moves to the real world of real players
and real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX>, and our footballer, still wearing his No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> jersey, seems to
be holding his own: "Your little guy's looking pretty good out there," says an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">approving</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> is studiously blasé: "Yeah, well," he says. "We've
been practicing."

            The game
over, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> walk away from us, satisfied. The little guy in the big
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shirt</ENAMEX> gets a pat on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX>: "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, that was a good game, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddy</ENAMEX>." The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tylenol</ENAMEX> name appears at the bottom of the screen in a strong but unobtrusive
red. A perfect end to a perfect day. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dad</ENAMEX>'s been injured, sure, but his pride is
intact, his love for his son papering over his shortcomings as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mom</ENAMEX>'s
still smiling, struck by the warmth and familiarity of this scene--and, the ad
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> hope, she's still turning up the dials and buying up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tylenol</ENAMEX>.
