            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> being <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
and politics being politics, the announcement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Glenn</ENAMEX>'s return to
space was the occasion for much sneering. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> mocked the space trip as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s payoff for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX>'s hackwork during the campaign fund-raising
hearings. ("He can go into orbit and stay there," snapped a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffer</ENAMEX>.) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skeptics</ENAMEX> added <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX>'s "scientific" mission to the
long list of . (Remember when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> gave shuttle rides to congressional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paymasters</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jake Garn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Nelson</ENAMEX>?)

            But if
it's easy to be cynical about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX>'s trip, it's nearly impossible to be
cynical about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> himself. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> confounds <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. The armor has no
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chink</ENAMEX>. His life proves that in politics virtue can triumph over
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">expediency</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> hasn't sacrificed principle for ambition: That's his blessing
and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> is as much a careerist as any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pol</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Wolfe</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chronicled</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Right Stuff</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> positioned himself carefully to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">astronaut</ENAMEX>. Selected for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercury</ENAMEX> program in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX>
paraded his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Marine</ENAMEX>-pilot heroism (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">149</NUMEX> missions in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX>), his
loving marriage, his religious faith. As it happened, all were genuine. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shepard</ENAMEX> beat <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> to space. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> to orbit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Earth</ENAMEX>, became the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superstar</ENAMEX> anyway. His eloquence, his calm in the face
of danger, his small-town-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> decency, his boyish freckles--they canonized
him. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Yorkers</ENAMEX> attended his welcome-home parade. He was the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold</ENAMEX>
War's greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>. (He was so revered that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Kennedy</ENAMEX> was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assassinated</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ethel Kennedy</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> to break the news to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.) And
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is the equal of his image: He is honest, hard-working, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">religious</ENAMEX>, patriotic, a devoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and a loving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>.

            When he
entered politics, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> vowed that he would never mortgage his reputation for
political gain. This pact was more selfless than it sounds: It ensured that
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> would never be disillusioned about its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>. Thanks to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">high-mindedness</ENAMEX>, he's had a peculiar, worthy, and forgettable political career.
Elected to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>, he has devoted himself to important, numbing
issues. He's the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>'s technocrat. He likes reading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX> reports. (He is, by his own admission, "dull.") <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> helped draft <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
nuclear-nonproliferation policy. He revels in the nitty-gritty of arms
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">treaties</ENAMEX>. He is an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> in the science and policy of nuclear-waste storage.
He pioneered the idea of reinventing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. Long before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> was
pushing to cut waste and rationalize government procurement. He has been, in
short, an admirable public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servant</ENAMEX>, a solid, stolid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX>.

            
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> was supposed to be more. He was to be
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eisenhower</ENAMEX>. He and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ike</ENAMEX> share freckles, a shiny skull, war
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heroism</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> never commanded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>. He does not know how to lead.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX>'s vision of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> is Platonic: a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> of the wise, elevated
above conflict and partisanship, that does what is right for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. But
bargain and compromise are the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> of politics. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> is a bad <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX>.
He makes his own decisions on principle and thinks his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> should do the
same. He doesn't do pork-barrel: He delivers goodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> only when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>
deserves them. He's never risen to the top ranks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> because he's
never been able to behave like a normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scruples</ENAMEX> (as well as his dullness) also doomed his quest for the presidency.
His <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX> campaign is a model of how to blow an election. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> entered the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> with enormous advantages: He had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-percent national name
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> and a stellar reputation. The movie of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Right Stuff</ENAMEX> ,
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lionized</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX>, opened just before primary season. He was a centrist in a
field of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX>. But he tanked it. He was a terrible fund-raiser, largely
because he didn't suck up to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>. More importantly, he failed to inspire
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> can't master the glib sound-bite rhetoric that characterizes
politics. He believes that speeches should explain facts as much as excite
emotion. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX>, notoriously, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> who gets more applause when he's
introduced than when he leaves.) In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>, he was soporific on the stump, boring
crowds with endless details of energy policy and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SALT</ENAMEX> negotiations. After
polling neck and neck with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Mondale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> finished <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>
caucuses, well behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Undecided</ENAMEX>. He also managed to lose every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> primary before quitting the race.

            Any <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-year</TIMEX> political career has its scars, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX>'s is
no exception. But here, too, he may deserve the benefit of the doubt. He still
carries a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3-million</NUMEX> debt from his presidential campaign. His reluctance to
fund raise partly explains the nonpayment of debt. A normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> would
have "invited" corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> to a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund raisers</ENAMEX>, cleared the debt, and
reciprocated with a few favors. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> is allergic to such politicking. He has
also taken too much abuse for his membership in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Five</TIMEX>. He accepted
more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200,000</NUMEX> in campaign contributions from S & L <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crook</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX>, and arranged a meeting for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> with then-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speaker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Wright</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Ethics Committee</ENAMEX> found <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> guilty of "poor judgment." But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX>
seems to have been oblivious rather than sleazy: "He was simply helping a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituent</ENAMEX>. It probably never occurred to him that he was doing anything
wrong. He was genuinely shocked that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> saw venality in his behavior," says
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Green</ENAMEX>, a political-science <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Akron</ENAMEX>.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last Feb. 20</TIMEX>, on the
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">35 th</NUMEX> anniversary of his space shot, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> announced that he wouldn't
seek re-election in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76-year-old</TIMEX> is increasingly out of place in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, which is a more unfriendly place than when he entered it. He's awkward
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opposition</ENAMEX>: There is too much sniping for him and not enough legislating.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX>'s performance in the campaign fund-raising hearings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last fall</TIMEX> highlighted
his unhappiness with his job. It was the low moment of his career. He
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stonewalled</ENAMEX> and disrupted the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> at every turn, contending that the
investigation was ignoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> wrongdoing. He did his party duty obediently,
but his own partisanship made him uncomfortable. He seems to know that he
doesn't belong in the increasingly nasty, uncollegial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>.

            But he does belong on the
shuttle. Yes, the ostensible reason for the mission--aging research--is
dubious. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s budgetary whoring is unseemly. And the appeal to public
sentiment is shameless. So what? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> has spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36 years</TIMEX> protecting the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of his life he spent in space, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36 years</TIMEX> living up to an impossibly heroic
image. He has done it admirably. His <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> trip into space was work. Doesn't he
deserve a vacation there?
