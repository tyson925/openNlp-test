            I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> realized something
was terribly, terribly wrong when a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox News</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> called me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>. She
wanted me to opine about the scandal on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, when the cable news channel
will do a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flytrap</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">marathon</ENAMEX> in anticipation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s testimony. Her
call was fishy for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasons: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) I am not usually <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, or last
on any TV booker's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guest</ENAMEX> list; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) she said the following to me,
imploringly: "We're really looking for something different. Can you be
different?"

            (Well, I thought to myself,
of course I can be different. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> always told me I was "different.")

            The
pursuit of wretched excess in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flytrap</ENAMEX>--a pursuit in which 
                  Slate
               
has eagerly participated--is producing some unfortunate results. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX>, which I
wrote about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>, is the rising popularity of preposterous conspiracy
theories. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Punditry Crisis</ENAMEX> is another. Not since the late-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.J.</ENAMEX> era has
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> faced such an alarming moment. Is there anything left to say?

            The crisis is, at bottom, a market failure. Ratings
demonstrate that TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> (never mind their protestations) want to hear about
Flytrap all the time. The gross appetites of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSNBC</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> must be sated.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crossfire</ENAMEX> must have fire. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardball</ENAMEX> must be hard. Face the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Nation</ENAMEX> must have someone to face. But there's not enough supply to meet the
demand. As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 17</TIMEX> approaches, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flytrap</ENAMEX> is in an information blackout. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> is silent, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> has stopped leaking. Every hypothesis has
been hypothesized. Every theory theorized. Every spin spun. Each tiny nugget of
new information is chewed, swallowed, regurgitated as cud, and chewed again.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pundits</ENAMEX> are reduced to flogging thirdhand and fourthhand rumors. Can any TV
watcher endure another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Turley</ENAMEX> sermon or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lanny Davis</ENAMEX> "wait and see" or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Ingraham huff</ENAMEX>?

            Too much
demand, too little supply. TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> are on a desperate, futile quest for
someone--or something--different to put on the air. (This crisis is not, of
course, limited to television: Those of us in the print and e-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> are
thrashing through the same news vacuum.)

            
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ireally</ENAMEX> don't know what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> will do. We
have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six days</TIMEX> to fill. And there's nothing," warns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlson</ENAMEX>. "If I had even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> new fact, I would lock it in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vault</ENAMEX> until I could
use it [in a column or on television]. If I had even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> new observation, I
would not breathe a word about it until I could use it. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> piece of real news
would eat all this [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blather</ENAMEX>] up like kudzu."

            Not every pundit is worrying
about the crisis. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Panglossian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX> claim there is no crisis at
all. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> compares <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flytrap</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX> trench battles: "No one is getting
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overrun</ENAMEX>, but steady progress is being made." In fact, he says, plenty of
fascinating new details emerge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>. (When asked for an example of such a
detail, he suggests, halfheartedly, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">what Monica ate</ENAMEX> for lunch.") And for
freshly minted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flytrap</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turley</ENAMEX>, there is no crisis, either. This
is their moment. No topic is so stale that it cannot be reheated: After all, it
gets you air time. And besides, say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panglossians</ENAMEX>, no matter how much
Flytrap nothing is being spewed, think how much worse it would be if there were
no scandal at all. At least it's something to talk about.

            But should we simply relax
and let the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Punditry Crisis</ENAMEX> grow into a catastrophe? Right-thinking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can
agree: We should not. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart Taylor Jr.</ENAMEX>, in a moment of high-minded optimism,
proposes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> take advantage of the information vacuum to talk about
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> principles. Instead of jabbing fingers over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>'s dress, for example,
they should discuss the fundamentals of sexual harassment law. I'm not sure
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX>'s worthy solution is possible but, whether it is or it isn't, I think we
can all concur that that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Punditry Crisis</ENAMEX> requires immediate action. Well,
maybe not action , but definitely a lot more talk.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> popular hypothesis about
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 17</TIMEX> is the notion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> won't admit/apologize because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> won't let him. She refuses to let him humiliate her. Further support
for this theory comes from a profile of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> rediscovered an astonishing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-month-old</TIMEX> quote from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first lady</ENAMEX>. Everyone remembers that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first lady</ENAMEX> blamed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flytrap</ENAMEX> on a
"vast right-wing conspiracy" in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> show interview during the first
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of the crisis. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> reminds <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of what else she said
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX>'s words are in italics):

            "If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> were proved
to have had an adulterous liaison while in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> people
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'should</ENAMEX> certainly be concerned about it ... if all that were proven true, I
think that would be a very serious offense. That is not going to be proven
true. I think we're going to find some other things. ' "

            This is,
admittedly, just a single line from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long-ago</TIMEX> interview, but it suggests that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clintons</ENAMEX> are locked into a denial. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> admits an affair, how could
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> ever explain away this quote? Can the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> do a mea culpa
knowing that the video of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> saying it "would be a very serious offense"
would be thrown back in his face again and again and again?
