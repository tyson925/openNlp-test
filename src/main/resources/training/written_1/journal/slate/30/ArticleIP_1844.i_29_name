            A visionary has the power to
imagine what the world can be, and a revolutionary has the power to make it so.
Very few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are either. Our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Man of the Year</ENAMEX> is both. Ideas have
consequences, and it is in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> that we have seen the consequences of his. With
his pinwheeling, hopscotch creativity, he has changed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s center of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gravity</ENAMEX>, reinventing commerce, art, science, technology, and faith. His
animating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirit</ENAMEX>--a pragmatic, idealistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humanitarianism</ENAMEX>--is rapidly becoming
the ethos of the age. His passing comments roil financial markets from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX>
to Bond Street. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moguls</ENAMEX> make pilgrimages to his seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> seeks his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX>. So does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Hawking</ENAMEX>. He is, it is said, the only
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who plays golf with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> and doesn't let him cheat.

            Still, he
is not yet a household name and may not be for some time. He is an unassuming
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>--a thatch of sandy hair, a pair of inquisitive brown eyes, a slight shadow
of beard at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all hours</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> of spectacular emotion, his was a
quiet triumph. He lacks the press savvy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. He doesn't touch the heart
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> did, or the conscience as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mother Teresa</ENAMEX> did (or the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pocketbook</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX> does). But while other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> make headlines, he
is making history. When they chronicle our time, it should be his name that
appears on the roll of honor.

            But only if ... His vision and his revolution are
high-risk gambles. If they fail--and no one can predict if they will--our world
will be a more dangerous place, a darker, poorer place, a world untethered from
the kind of stability we have come to cherish. And if he succeeds? "Every so
often God blesses us," says his close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">confidant</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dalai Lama</ENAMEX>, "and
he is such a blessing."

            To understand him, to
understand both his leathery toughness and his gentle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>, follow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Route</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">44</NUMEX> west from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lubbock</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 miles</NUMEX>. Here, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 miles</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lubbock</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX> from nowhere, is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-stoplight town called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Poseyville</ENAMEX>. And here, up the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Diner</ENAMEX>--though there's no river for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX>--is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-room
cabin. It is in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five decades ago</TIMEX>, that his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> came, alone, a
young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX> trying to start over with her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>. That little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was
his crucible. They grew up together, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>. They studied together on
the oilcloth-covered kitchen table, beneath the only electric light in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">house.</ENAMEX> He learned his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABCs</ENAMEX>; she slowly, slowly earned her degree via
correspondence. And when the lessons were over, she instilled in him the
homespun wisdom that her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> had instilled in her: "The power is the word,
not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword</ENAMEX>." "There is no difficulty so great that it cannot be overcome, no
triumph so great that it cannot be destroyed." His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> still lives in the
same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, but electric lights are everywhere now. He phones her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>, at
noon sharp. (Once he excused himself from an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX> to
call.)

            "From the
time he was a boy," she confides, "I knew that destiny had reserved him a
seat." If destiny had indeed reserved him a seat, it was in the very front of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX>. He was an A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poseyville High</ENAMEX>. He was also a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-sport <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> and "the most ferocious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX> I've ever seen," his coach
says <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. Even as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-ager</ENAMEX>, he showed signs of his independent-mindedness.
His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> mowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX>; he climbed mountains. They took piano lessons; he
taught himself the trombone and busked for dimes on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Main Street</ENAMEX>.

            
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adversity</ENAMEX>," wrote the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rainer Maria Rilke</ENAMEX>,
"is the seedling of courage." And adversity came. He headed east for college on
scholarship. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, alone again, fell ill. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School</ENAMEX> was a struggle. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midway</ENAMEX>
through his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">freshman year</TIMEX>, he gave up, hitchhiked <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, and told his mother he
was back for good to take care of her. That <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, they went out for a walk on
the plains. "It was," he says, "a clear, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">moonlit night</TIMEX>. We walked by an old
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch house</ENAMEX>, and I could see the barbed wire and the old brands glinting in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">moonlight</ENAMEX>. All of a sudden I thought of when the world was young and growing
and full of hope. And I wanted to make it so again." <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">The next morning</TIMEX>, he
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hitchhiked</ENAMEX> back <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX>.

            His mind
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">burns</ENAMEX> with a bright, clear flame, and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX> soon recognized his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX>. He earned his degree in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> and went to work. He astonished.
"He could see around corners," says an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX>. He overturned
conventional wisdom, and preached heresy. In the beginning, he was dismissed as
a crackpot--at best an eccentric, at worst a threat. But steadily his fame and
power and influence grew. He was not an intellectual, and he had no time for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ideology</ENAMEX>, but he had the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> for common sense. His own powerful
ideas rooted themselves in society's cracks and began to sprout in all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directions</ENAMEX>. And sprout. And sprout.

            Today, despite his fame, he remains a startlingly humble
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Every morning</TIMEX>, while he's in the bath, he tries to answer his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of
personal letters. He's never missed a high-school reunion, and he still finds
time to eat dinner with childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX>. "When he got famous, I
was sure he'd forget us," says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> old playmate, "but he hasn't." His charm is
legendary. So is his equanimity. When his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> panic over some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nugget</ENAMEX> of bad
news, he calms them down by quoting his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sages</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lao Tzu, Euripedes, Toynbee</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Covey</ENAMEX>.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every day</TIMEX>, he says, he
receives a letter or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> urging him to run for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. He laughs the idea
off. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> is a captive. He is a free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, and in freedom is true
power. This is, he says, only the beginning of his crusade. In the third
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, after the invention of the fulcrum and lever, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Archimedes</ENAMEX> wrote, "Give
me where to stand, and I will move the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>." It is now the cusp of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">millennium</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Man of the Year</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two feet</NUMEX> planted squarely on the ground.
And the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> is moving.
