            In recent photos I've seen
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dylan</ENAMEX>, he's wearing a lopsided, bemused grin, the smile of someone who
can't quite believe what's happening to him. If you were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dylan</ENAMEX>, you'd be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">puzzled</ENAMEX>, too. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX> paid homage
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kennedy Center Honors</ENAMEX>--an event that usually celebrates
old respectables such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Hope</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Sinatra</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dylan</ENAMEX> shaved and even wore
a tuxedo. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX>, it was the recording industry's turn to suck up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dylan</ENAMEX>.
Having all but shut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dylan</ENAMEX> out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grammies</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 35 years</TIMEX>, it
lavished <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> awards on his new record, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Time Out of Mind</ENAMEX> , including
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Album of the Year</ENAMEX>.

            There is
general agreement that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dylan</ENAMEX> honors signify Something Very Important about
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '60s</TIMEX>. The most popular explanation is a political one: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dylan</ENAMEX> in a tux is
the final, ironic nail in the counterculture coffin. The establishment has
finally co-opted the ultimate anti-establishment figure. Dylan, the story goes,
was the icon for the lefty politics of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '60s</TIMEX>: He sang "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Blowin' in the Wind</ENAMEX>"
and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Masters of War</ENAMEX>" and was the role model for a generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protestors</ENAMEX>.
Once he sang, "Don't follow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>." Now--sniff--he's hanging out with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>.

            But this is a misapprehension of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dylan</ENAMEX>. He was never as
much of a counterculturist as his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> believed, and he was certainly never
much of a politico. Except for a brief, awkward foray into the civil-rights
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">movement, Dylan</ENAMEX> essentially ignored political activism during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '60s</TIMEX>. At a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> when every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musician</ENAMEX> spoke out against the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam War</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dylan</ENAMEX> did not. He
ignored presidential campaigns and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lefty crusades</ENAMEX>. He never preached, or much
sympathized with, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hippie</ENAMEX> rhetoric. He denied, and still denies, that his songs
had a political significance: He licensed "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Times They Are A-Changin'</ENAMEX> " for
a bank advertisement.

            If there
is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX> of which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dylan</ENAMEX> is a symbol, it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '70s</TIMEX>. He has always pursued
self-actualization rather than protest, artistic fulfillment rather than
politics. Pause for requisite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dylan</ENAMEX> mantra: "He not busy being born is busy
dying." (For a personal-growth slogan, this is pretty gloomy. But it is a
pretty grim song.) Neocons have always claimed that narcissism, not ideology,
inspired the rebelliousness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dylan</ENAMEX>'s generation. Dylan, the most inward
looking of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX>, a selfish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX>, gives that claim credence.

            
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> pander to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>. Dylan
has built a career designed to satisfy no one but himself. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX>, for
example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dylan</ENAMEX> went electric, abandoning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX>'s soft sound, earnest politics,
and rabidly loyal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX>. When some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pop musicians</ENAMEX> turned to psychedelia in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late '60s</TIMEX>, this one stripped his songs down and played basic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A decade later</TIMEX>, at a time of high hedonism, he found <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> and composed gospel
music. Dylan, who modeled himself on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Dean</ENAMEX>, spent a vast amount of time
away from music trying to build a movie career--despite a total absence of
acting charisma.

            
Throughout his career, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dylan</ENAMEX> has frustrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> by deconstructing his golden
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oldies</ENAMEX>. When he plays his hits in concerts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dylan</ENAMEX> often twists them, garbling
their lyrics and sandblasting their melodies into strange new creations.
(Anyone who has attended a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dylan</ENAMEX> show in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 20 years</TIMEX> knows the feeling:
He plays a song you've always loved, and you can't even recognize it.
"That was 'Tangled Up in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue</ENAMEX>'<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>")

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dylan</ENAMEX> got bad, but he never got stale. His constant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reinvention</ENAMEX> and his constant touring saved him from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock geezerhood</ENAMEX>. If you go
to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rolling Stones or Eagles</ENAMEX> concert--and I strongly advise against
it--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three-quarters</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> will be paunchy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX> reliving their
glory <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. They'll sing along to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30-year-old</TIMEX> songs performed exactly as they
were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years ago</TIMEX>. Were there any more embarrassing <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> during the
Grammies than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fleetwood Mac</ENAMEX>'s performance? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloated</ENAMEX>, sloppy, and greedy, the
band regurgitated a medley of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'70s</NUMEX> hits to vast applause. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dylan</ENAMEX> has been
touring nonstop since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, winning over an entire generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> to his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">music</ENAMEX> (both new and old). <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> may be waxing nostalgic over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dylan</ENAMEX>, but there
has never been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musician</ENAMEX> less concerned with nostalgia.

            In an age when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX>
expose themselves promiscuously, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dylan</ENAMEX> rejects public self-revelation. Is there
any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> about whom we know less? It's not that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dylan</ENAMEX>'s invisible: He plays 150
concerts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>, and he does occasional interviews. But he says little about
his music and nothing about his life. His marriage, his divorce, his personal
life: All are ciphers in the public consciousness.

            (He has
mellowed slightly since his younger <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, when he took pleasure in torturing
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX>.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reporter</ENAMEX>: What do you do with your money?

            

               Dylan: I wear it.

            
               Another
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>: What are your songs about?

            

               Dylan: Some of my songs are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, some are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about five</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> and some, believe it or not, are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 11 or 12</NUMEX>.)

            
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dylan</ENAMEX> never schmoozed much within the music
business. His failure to win <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grammies</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '60s</TIMEX> was hardly a surprise.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grammies</ENAMEX> have always trailed hipness by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX> or more. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-'60s</TIMEX>,
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dylan</ENAMEX> was at his peak, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herb Alpert</ENAMEX> was winning <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Album of the Year</ENAMEX> awards.
Recently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grammies</ENAMEX> have become more current by adding categories, and they
have begun to repay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of neglect. Besides honoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dylan</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">academy</ENAMEX> also gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Fogerty</ENAMEX> his first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grammy</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fogerty</ENAMEX> never won
an award for the brilliant records he made with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Credence Clearwater Revival</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three decades ago</TIMEX>.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dylan</ENAMEX> probably won't
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reinvent</ENAMEX> himself again. He said recently that songs don't come to him easily
anymore: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> Out of Mind is his first album of new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. It's a wonderful record: Its blues/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> songs are bleak, beautiful,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hypnotic</ENAMEX>. But it sounds like a return to something old and comfortable rather
than progress to something new and strange.

            And even if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dylan</ENAMEX> does have
another transformation within him, his voice may not. Opera <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singers</ENAMEX> who take
care of their voices can perform only into their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixties</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dylan</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>, and his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">voice</ENAMEX>--ripped by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, and cigarettes and never that good to begin
with--is much older. Writing in 
                  Slate
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Ross</ENAMEX> called
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> Out of Mind "the first great rock album of old age" in part because Dylan
manages to sing around his weak voice. As you can hear on this clip from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> Out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mind</ENAMEX> 's "Not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dark</TIMEX> Yet," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dylan</ENAMEX>'s voice doesn't have much left.
His range, already narrow, will soon be just a bleat. But better to go out
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bleating</ENAMEX> "Not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dark</TIMEX> Yet" than croaking through "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Blowin' in the Wind</ENAMEX>" for the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> time.
