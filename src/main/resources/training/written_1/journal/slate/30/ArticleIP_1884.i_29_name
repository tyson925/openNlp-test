            Many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, when farm
subsidies were still something of a novelty, an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.R.</ENAMEX>
Gross used to tell of a letter he got from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituent</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, as I
recall, had heard that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> was paying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> not to raise
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hogs</ENAMEX> and, since he thought that was a trade for which he might have some
talent, he wanted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX>'s help in applying for the program. His plans
were modest, not raising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> to start. But after he got the
hang of it, he thought he could build up to a substantial nonscale.

            Of
course, not raising <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hogs</ENAMEX> can be a pretty smelly business (not!). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nowadays</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituent</ENAMEX> could aspire to more antiseptic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">digs</ENAMEX>. He could enter the
not-training-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> profession--though he'd have to move to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> state if
he wanted to get in on the ground floor of this promising industry. And he'd
have to find a place at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> that have volunteered
to participate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare Graduate Medical Education Demonstration Project</ENAMEX>
approved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Care Financing Administration</ENAMEX>. The
project will pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $400 million</NUMEX> in cash to these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. In return, they
have agreed not to train <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 20 percent and 25 percent</NUMEX> of the medical
residents they would otherwise have trained over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next six years</TIMEX>. Hospitals
in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> were quick to complain that they had not been offered the same
opportunity for sacrifice to the cause of medical progress. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFA</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Vladeck</ENAMEX>, explained that the effort was necessarily limited
in scope until the success of the strategy had been tested. This is, after all,
a demonstration project.

            You might have thought that the proposition that when the
government hands out money someone will take it had already been amply
demonstrated. Or, you might have wondered why, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is faced with an
imminent glut of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>, this is something the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> should worry about.
Weren't we taught in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economics</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> that if supply of a product exceeds demand
for it, the price will fall? And that demand will then pick up, and/or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> will cut back, and things will return to equilibrium? Don't we want
lower medical prices? Isn't that what the whole nasty fight over managed care
and restraining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> costs is all about? Why not just let the market's
invisible hand perform the necessary surgery?

            But that
would presume that we had something like a competitive market operating in the
medical sector. Of course, we do not. In fact, we could not. Even the
best-educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX> probably can't be expected to shop intelligently for all
but the most basic health services. Inevitably, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and other care
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX> will dictate both the type and quantity of treatments that their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receive--as long as they are able to pay. And since health care is
rightly regarded as a public good, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wealthy</ENAMEX> as ours will inevitably
provide a host of subsidies, both public and private, to encourage us to
swallow a good deal more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> than we would if we paid for it out of our
own pockets.

            
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, we pay the bill in the form of
lower wages, higher prices, and higher taxes, but it doesn't feel that way.
Markets operate on felt signals, and it is taking too long for the signal that
there is an excess of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> (especially very high-priced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>) to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">impinge</ENAMEX> upon the supply-producing parts of the system. Bright young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,
attracted both by the satisfying aspects of caring for their fellow citizens
and by the high net income (an average in excess of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$190,000</NUMEX>) that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>
receive, are still queuing up to undertake the grueling and expensive training
that the profession requires. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, encouraged by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> subsidies,
are all too willing to provide that training.

            So
generous are the government subsidies for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> training (as much as
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>), that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> have reaped nice profits by using these
journeymen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> to do things that less-skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> could do as well.
And since the longer a resident <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX>, the larger the total subsidy, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> has also encouraged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> to extend their educations and become
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> rather than lower-paid general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>. Now with managed care
and government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> cracking down on in-hospital care, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> are
facing a shortage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to practice upon.

            Cutting back on resident subsidies seems the obvious
solution. But teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, the undisputed crown <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jewels</ENAMEX> of the medical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, are already under great financial strain. (And in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, they are
guarded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> and a politically potent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>.) As in the
case of agriculture--in which a complex edifice of subsidies has also succeeded
in developing an industry whose products are unmatched in quality, quantity,
and variety--reform is rarely straightforward.

            So HCFA
has settled on a convoluted solution: continuing the subsidies for the
residents that are trained, but paying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> additional amounts not to
train as many. This, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> calculates, will save it <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $300 million</NUMEX> over
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX> of the "demonstration." "Brilliant and bizarre" is how experts
characterized the scheme in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> .

            
Where will it all end? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vladeck</ENAMEX> has
already entertained extending the program, noting that if jealous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressmen</ENAMEX>
from other jurisdictions "think this is a good deal, they have the power to
make it more available." Really? How widely? Surely, most of us can take credit
for not having trained a legion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>?

            And why limit payments to
the medical sector? Many will feel that the case for subsidizing the
nonproduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> is weak when law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> are still cranking out
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> by the caseload. Others may feel that the money would be better spent
in paying the defense industry not to produce the latest round of high-tech
weaponry, thus saving us the expense of generating still more lethal weapons
when the current <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> inevitably falls into the hands of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>. Why not
pay poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> not to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX>? Come to think of it, that's what the welfare
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> was meant to do.

            Which may bring us to the
moral of our story: When you start paying for nonproduction you are almost sure
to reap a bumper <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX>.
