            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> have long been a
terrible disappointment to the child-care community. When questioned, they
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">persistently</ENAMEX> fail to express dissatisfaction with their current child-care
arrangements or even much difficulty in finding such care. Yet, with equal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">persistence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> keep proclaiming a child-care crisis.

            The
latest hue and cry has been raised in regard to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> welfare-reform
legislation that aims to send <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of welfare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> into the labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>,
and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, presumably, into surrogate care. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> of the new law argue
that suitable care is in short supply. (For an example of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>, see
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Edelman</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dialogue</ENAMEX>" in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mickey Kaus</ENAMEX>.) Yet past experience
suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who want to work can and will find child care that suits
their needs.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Way</ENAMEX> back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>, when custodial care for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> first became
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">causists</ENAMEX>' favorite cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">célèbre</ENAMEX> , the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children's Bureau</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau</ENAMEX> jointly issued the findings of a survey they had conducted. The
study, said the foreword, "clearly indicates how urgent is the need for
large-scale expansion of day care services." If so, you would have a hard time
telling it from the data presented. When questioned, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92 percent</NUMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> covered said they thought their child-care arrangements were quite
satisfactory.

            This clash
of perceptions is accounted for by the fact that most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in
question, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98 percent</NUMEX> to be exact, were not being cared for in the type of
setting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> favored--a licensed day-care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, nursery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, or
like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>. Most were being cared for by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, or small-scale
care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>. Some <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 percent</NUMEX> were "latch-key" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who were expected to
look after themselves. These, moreover, were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> when federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> set
utopian standards for acceptable care. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Health</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welfare</ENAMEX> decided to set up its own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, it found it
could not meet the requirements for windows and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> per square foot,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutritionists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">therapists</ENAMEX> per square <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, and so on.

            
More than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policy-makers</ENAMEX> are still disagreeing. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> in which a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> survey was done, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> said they were satisfied
(<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79 percent</NUMEX> were "very satisfied") with their care arrangements. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra Clark</ENAMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urban Institute</ENAMEX>, notes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> may be embarrassed to
admit they leave their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in questionable settings. And for many
"working-poor" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, day-care expenses are an enormous burden. But even
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> were asked if they would prefer other arrangements--and who among
us resists betterment?--<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 26 percent</NUMEX> answered yes.

            But it is
not only child-care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> who have been frustrated by the research
findings. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX> brought disappointing news to another faction in the
day-care battle: those who deplore the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> as harmful to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. No doubt to the annoyance and disbelief of day-care
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX>, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockford Institute</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Center</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Family</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, a study newly released by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institute of Child Health</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Development</ENAMEX> found that day care does not hinder a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s intellectual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. Nor, except for a small effect for very young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in long
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of care, does it affect their emotional bond with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>.

            Many more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, of course, are in licensed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> than
was the case in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>. Current center capacity is estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 5 million</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. Still, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> survey found <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 28 percent</NUMEX> of preschoolers with working
moms were in center care. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Another 20 percent</NUMEX> were in licensed day-care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>.
As you would expect, higher-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> are more likely to use relatively
expensive center care than are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working poor</ENAMEX>; but, thanks to government
subsidies, the "non-working poor"--i.e., welfare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>--are almost as likely
as middle-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working mothers</ENAMEX> to have their youngest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>.

            Center
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> is not, however, a guarantee of quality. Nor is price. Quality, the Urban
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra Clark</ENAMEX> points out, is not an easy thing to measure. Still,
according to the new study, the quality of the care does matter--especially
whether the caregivers talk and interact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> frequently. A flurry
of recent research, recently reported in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time magazine</ENAMEX> cover story, points to the importance of
early stimulation in the later development of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s brain. (And with a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> of high-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seniors</ENAMEX> being rated functionally illiterate on standard
reading tests, it seems pretty clear that some additional stimulation is
needed.) Yet many centers, especially those neither serving higher-income
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> nor competing for government subsidies, are plagued by poorly trained,
low-paid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>; high turnover; and insufficient supervision.

            
And here is where the disappointing parents
come in again. Testifying before a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra Hofferth</ENAMEX> reported that her studies show that while parents
claim to care about quality, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX> they opt for "price and convenience."
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suzanne W. Helburn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John R. Morris</ENAMEX> reached a similar conclusion
in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> study of the market: "A major cause of the mediocre quality found in
the child care industry--both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and family care--is the lack of demand for
it." They recommend finding a way to "alarm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> so they ... confront the
conflict between adult fulfillment versus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s developmental needs."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX>
of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>, and others besides, point to a misdirection of federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> does provide direct day-care subsidies to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1 million</NUMEX>
low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> (the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programs</ENAMEX> currently spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $2.3 billion</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>, in addition to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $4 billion</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Head Start</ENAMEX>), and some of those
subsidies come with quality strings attached. But the largest single federal
day-care subsidy is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dependent Care Tax Credit</ENAMEX>, which now distributes more
than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.7 billion</NUMEX> in tax rebates <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>, mostly to middle- and higher-income
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. And, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helburn and Morris</ENAMEX> point out, since tax credits can be used for
any kind of care the parents choose--and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> being the way they are--tax
breaks are "not good tools for ensuring good quality." (They may not even be
good tools for buying day care. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> started asking
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> number of their putative day-care
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">provider</ENAMEX>, claims for credits dropped markedly.)

            From this perspective, the recently passed welfare reform
could be a blessing to some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Advocates</ENAMEX> worry that if substantial numbers
of welfare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> are pushed into jobs, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> might be swamped by demands to
serve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as a million</NUMEX> added <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. That probably won't happen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Butler</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manpower Development Research Corp.</ENAMEX>, which has been the prime evaluator
of welfare-to-work programs, points out that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> have routinely
overestimated the amount of formal child care needed for such projects. And the
new law also exempts from participation any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under 6</TIMEX> for
whom affordable, accessible, and suitable care cannot be found. On the plus
side, the reforms will increase federal money for child care by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $600</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. If states take advantage of the various incentives provided
them (though few probably will), total federal and state support could expand
from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $2.8 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $5 billion</NUMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urban</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> estimates. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> will also be freed from the hodgepodge of
regulations that currently cause gaps in coverage as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> move among <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>,
training, and work.

            If many more welfare parents
do find and hold jobs, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> might well benefit from the
intellectually stimulating care many of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> cannot provide--if that's
the sort of substitute care they actually get. Still, as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> study points out, whatever effect day care has on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> is swamped by
the impact of their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kids</ENAMEX> with well-educated, emotionally stable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and secure economic circumstances tend to do fine, whether their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> work or not. Others not so lucky in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> often do
not. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urban Institute</ENAMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabel Sawhill</ENAMEX> notes, "we license day
care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, but we don't license <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>." Perhaps we should.
