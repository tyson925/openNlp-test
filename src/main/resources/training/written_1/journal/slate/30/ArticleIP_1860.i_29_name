            Ever
since the media first noticed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Louis "Skip" Gates Jr.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of
Afro-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> studies at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>, he has held their attention and affection. He
may now be the most famous literature <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, and it's easy to
understand why. Besides being , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> for good in the world. Known
by fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> for his theories linking the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afro</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> literary
tradition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> vernacular and for his excavation of forgotten
masterpieces of black literature, he caught the public's eye in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> when he
published several salutary and well-reasoned articles criticizing the
inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Semitic</ENAMEX> rhetoric of certain black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationalists</ENAMEX>. The all-star
department he's built at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past seven years</TIMEX> (it includes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Julius Wilson</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">philosopher Cornel West</ENAMEX>) has helped elevate "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Afro-Am</ENAMEX>" from relative marginality
to one of the most thrilling and visible disciplines around. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorker</ENAMEX> , where he is a staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, he has produced several strong pieces
of literary journalism on subjects as varied as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Belafonte</ENAMEX> and the
declining importance of loyalty.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> does so many things at the same time that you have to
wonder how he makes sure all of them meet the same high standard. The answer
is, he can't. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> alone, according to his c urriculum vitae , he wrote
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> long pieces for The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> , published <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> book, and
edited <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more. He also supervised doctoral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissertations</ENAMEX>, taught two
undergraduate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, ran <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American</ENAMEX>
Research (raising funds, balancing budgets, recruiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX>, planning
conferences), served as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of editorial content for a publishing imprint
he co-founded, was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Spielberg</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amistad</ENAMEX> , scripted
and hosted a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frontline</ENAMEX> documentary on the black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bourgeoisie</ENAMEX>, and
developed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-part <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC-PBS</ENAMEX> documentary on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>--the entire continent. He
continued as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of Transition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Periodical</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Literature Project</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zora Neale Hurston Library</ENAMEX> series; the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-volume
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African-American Women Writers</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1910-1940</TIMEX> ; and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 million</NUMEX> word
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Encyclopedia Africana</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nominally</ENAMEX>, at least, he sat on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">82</TIMEX> advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">theaters</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutes</ENAMEX>, literary prizes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>.

            Gates
works very hard. Most <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, he starts writing at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 a.m.</TIMEX> A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,000</NUMEX>-word New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorker</ENAMEX> profile that would take most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> flows
effortlessly from his pen. An incisive piece on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Farrakhan</ENAMEX> was reported
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>, written <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, edited <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, and closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>. Gates
drafted his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">216</NUMEX>-page memoir, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colored People</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>), in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX>, though
thought the final result reflected the hasty composition.

            
But hard work alone doesn't explain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>'
output. He also understands a fundamental maxim of capitalism: Don't do
yourself what you can pay others to do for you.

            It is a
time-honored perquisite of senior professorship to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> act as
minions, fetching books from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> and doing grunt research. Many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> have figured out how to turn this somewhat feudal tradition into an
industry. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Bloom</ENAMEX> served as the
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>" of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX> anthologies of literary criticism, even though it was graduate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> (and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few undergraduates</NUMEX>) who actually waded into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> and
picked out the selections. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> pushes the envelope. He may be the only
academic with a self-designated "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of staff</ENAMEX>" who handles <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> details
and deals with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> edits his writing. Another conducts
research, keeping him abreast of the latest developments in hip-hop and digging
up quotes for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> pieces. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Dozens</NUMEX> of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> are
hired to help produce his various projects. To put together <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> volume,
The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictionary of Global Culture</ENAMEX> , for instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>
research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistants</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> fact checkers, in addition to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>. (For this
piece, I spoke with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> current and former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.)

            The project <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> considers his most important is also his
most lucrative to date--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Encyclopedia Africana</ENAMEX> , co-edited with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appiah</ENAMEX>. Originally conceived by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Bois</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Encyclopedia</ENAMEX> is intended to
be the definitive guide to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diaspora</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> says it will
be the factually unassailable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> upon which Afro-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> studies will
grow to maturity. It is designed to trounce, once and for all, the fictions
promulgated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Afrocentrists</ENAMEX> (they hold, among other things, that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> ran the
slave trade and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptians</ENAMEX> were black). To finance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Encyclopedia</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> reportedly cut a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 million</NUMEX> deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> to put out a CD-ROM;
signed a book deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civitas</ENAMEX>, the imprint he co-owns; and formed a
partnership with music <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mogul</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quincy Jones</ENAMEX>.

            A closer
look at how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, are putting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Encyclopedia</ENAMEX> together,
however, raises the question of whether reference works benefit from a Gatesian
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pace</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Writers</ENAMEX> have been told to hit a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> word a day quota. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editors</ENAMEX>, at times,
have had to groom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,000</NUMEX> words a day. Their pay depends on it. The results are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unimpressive</ENAMEX>. According to some of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> on the project, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">execs</ENAMEX> grouched that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150,000</NUMEX> word batch of entries they received was
poorly organized and badly written. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> later confessed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> that he
had made an appalling discovery: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly one-third</NUMEX> of the entries had been
plagiarized wholesale from other reference books. (For the record: This
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magazine</ENAMEX> is owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>. However, no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> spoke to me
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skip Gates</ENAMEX>' project. My information comes exclusively from current and
former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> himself.)

            
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Encyclopedia</ENAMEX> is due out in stores
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next February</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> says he has become much more involved in editing the book
so as to avoid further anomalies. According to some who have worked on the
project, however, his main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> still seems to be meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s
deadlines. He has described the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Encyclopedia</ENAMEX> to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">classic Microsoft</ENAMEX> terms: If <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Version 1.0</ENAMEX> contains bugs and glitches, not to
worry. You let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> point out problems, then try to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Version 2.0</ENAMEX>
right.

            With an
electronic encyclopedia, a process of constant revision may have its
advantages--unless you're among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Version 1.0</ENAMEX>. But print is
less flexible. The last large-scale reference work <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> co-edited, also with
Appiah, was The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictionary of Global Culture</ENAMEX> , published last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. The book was meant to be the multiculturalist rebuttal to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.D. Hirsch</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jr.</ENAMEX>'s controversial <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Dictionary</ENAMEX> of Cultural Literacy (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>); the idea
was to highlight the accomplishments of non-Western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> and their
contributions to Western culture. But it was too weirdly conceived and poorly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edited</ENAMEX> to do all that. As a response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hirsch</ENAMEX>, it is irrelevant, appearing
long after most had forgotten <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hirsch</ENAMEX>'s book. It is also filled with easily
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dismissable</ENAMEX> . As a reference work it fails, because entries are shorter and
less informative than most entries for the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in even the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Encyclopedia Britannica</ENAMEX> . And it is .

            Why would <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> allow the publication of such a book with
his byline and photo on the dust jacket? He had no idea it was so bad. After
coming up with the idea for the project and appointing an "associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>" to
run it, he says, he was only minimally involved. According to those who edited
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> read entries only just before they were sent to
press, then looked closely only at items within his area of expertise, such as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harlem Renaissance</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hurston</ENAMEX>. The book's introduction was drafted by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appiah</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>'
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>-page <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> is packed with other projects to which he devotes scant energy.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1992 and 1998</TIMEX>, for example, he contributed not a single word to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> of
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> where he is listed as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>. He does none of the line
editing of articles for Transition , even though it proclaims his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">editorship</ENAMEX> in ads. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 40</TIMEX> volume <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schomburg Library of Nineteenth-Century</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Women Writers</ENAMEX> he edited, he appointed others to put together the
books and write their introductions. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> helped put together
The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norton Anthology of African American Literature</ENAMEX> , even though
it was his byline that appeared on the cover.

            
The activities cited here would not be unusual,
or even objectionable, if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> imposed strict quality control standards upon
them. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of scholarly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>' editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> rarely edit; they are
guarantors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>' intellectual integrity--which is to say, they're
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">figureheads</ENAMEX>. And if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> didn't edit the anthologies himself, his name
nonetheless lent credibility and, therefore, enhanced funding prospects to
deserving projects. Reference books are perforce feats of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, not
individual scholarship.

            The problem is, the work
that comes out of his scholarly chop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> isn't nearly as good as it should
be. And even if it were, there is something dishonest about marketing under
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>' signature work that is produced mainly by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistants</ENAMEX>. At worst, he
is amassing credentials, fame, and wealth on the basis of others' uncredited
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">labor</ENAMEX>--once considered a scholarly sin. At best, he is severely diluting the
brand name that is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Louis Gates Jr.</ENAMEX>--a brand name based in large part on .
This is bound to hurt both his own reputation and that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprises</ENAMEX> he
believes in so sincerely.

            So why
does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> produce at such a frantic pace? A profile in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> issue of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Magazine</ENAMEX> hinted it was for the money; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> put <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>'
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> income at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $1 million</NUMEX>. He denies both the amount and the motive.
He clearly is driven by a kind of missionary zeal: "I think that these projects
will make a difference to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and the field of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afro</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> studies. I am a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">canon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builder</ENAMEX>," he told me. Another explanation may lie in his brilliance: He
comes up with more ideas than he can handle, and he lacks the discipline not to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overextend</ENAMEX> himself. "By impulse, I am an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX>," he says. "If I weren't
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">academy</ENAMEX>, I could be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quincy Jones</ENAMEX> is my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>. I have a picture of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vernon Jordan</ENAMEX> on my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>, right over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hope Franklin</ENAMEX>." It's an
appealing image for a professoriate that has long been accused of being out of
touch and moribund--the consummate schmoozer combined with the eminent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> just wishes the results looked more like scholarship.
