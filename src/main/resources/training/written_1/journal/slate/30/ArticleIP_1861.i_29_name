            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Will</ENAMEX> has a book
coming out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>. This normally would not qualify as news, since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George</ENAMEX>
Will always has a book coming out and it is usually disappearing quietly into
the back catalog of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conservative Book of the Month Club</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Woven</ENAMEX>
Figure<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">: Conservatism and America's Fabric</ENAMEX>, 
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994-1997</TIMEX> ; The
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Leveling Wind: Politics</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culture</ENAMEX>, and Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990-1994</TIMEX> ;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Restoration</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, Term Limits, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Recovery of Deliberative</ENAMEX>
Democracy [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>] ...).

            But this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>'s book is news, because <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>'s book is about <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>. When Will
writes about <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America</ENAMEX> pays attention. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Work</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Craft of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Baseball</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>), his first baseball book, outsold his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> other books
combined. It is also the best-selling baseball book ever. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX>'s new volume,
Bunts: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curt Flood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Camden Yards</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete Rose</ENAMEX>, and Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reflections</ENAMEX> on
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Baseball</ENAMEX> , collects <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX> of his columns and essays on the sport.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX>, who was supposed to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Lippmann</ENAMEX> of this
conservative <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>, finds himself in a curious position. He writes a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twice-weekly</TIMEX>
column that appears in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and a biweekly column for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> . He also appears every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s This
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Week</TIMEX> . His pinched, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professorial</ENAMEX> face may be the most recognizable mug in
journalism. His starchy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenor</ENAMEX> is certainly among its most recognizable voices.
Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX>'s views aren't news anymore. His columns don't shape national policy
and aren't heeded by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s power <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX>. He's no big deal.

            Will titled his latest book
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bunts</ENAMEX> because "bunts are modest and often useful things." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX> himself
has become a bunt. Why this has happened has less to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX> than it does
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> column.

            The middle
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years of this century</TIMEX> were a golden age for newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnists</ENAMEX>. When
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lippmann</ENAMEX> launched his column in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1931</TIMEX>, he had no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX>. Journalism was
smaller, politics was smaller, and the power elite could be reached easily
through a few newspaper op-ed pages. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lippmann</ENAMEX> and a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Alsop</ENAMEX>,
especially) were more than just <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnists</ENAMEX>; they were national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX>, both
shaping and reflecting popular opinion. When they spoke, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
listened.

            
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early '80s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX> seemed poised to assume
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lippmann</ENAMEX> mantle. Born in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941</TIMEX>, he had jumped from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kennedy Democrat</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Goldwater Republican</ENAMEX> while a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early '60s</TIMEX>. After a few
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> teaching political science, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX> entered journalism in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early '70s</TIMEX> as
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Review</ENAMEX> , making his name as one of the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> to call for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s impeachment. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> gave him an op-ed column. A TV gig, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> column, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pulitzer Prize</ENAMEX> soon followed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William F. Buckley Jr.</ENAMEX> had preached the
conservative gospel to a relatively small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">following</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX>, syndicated in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of papers, was the first conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> to reach a mainstream
national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX> became opinion journalism's enfant terrible ,
slashing the dearest liberal icons and pushing a hard-right foreign policy. (He
was more terrible than enfant : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX> never had anything youthful
about him.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>'s election propelled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX> to national fame. He was pegged as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> who would popularize the new conservative age. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Reagan</ENAMEX> lunched
with him; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> called him to chat. (His closeness to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> got Will
.) His column was perceived as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s official opinion. He was fluent in
all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>: His columns were stylish and eloquent--they were greased up with
quotes from dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Englishmen</ENAMEX>--and they made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> feel smarter. His orotund
style translated surprisingly well to television, where--even as a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40-year-old</TIMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX> managed to exude an aura of ancient wisdom (the bow tie and
priggish manner helped). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> labeled him "the most
powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>."

            But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX> was not destined for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lippmannian</ENAMEX> omnipotence. The
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> limit on his influence was that he was not quite as much of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reagan</ENAMEX>
courtier as he was made out to be. often clashed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> policy, and he was
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savage</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX>. (He tagged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> a "lap <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>.") More importantly,
journalism wouldn't permit another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lippmann</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lippmann</ENAMEX> wrote, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnists</ENAMEX>
were new and few. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '80s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> was inundated by opinion. The TV talk
shows diluted the influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnists</ENAMEX>. So did other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnists</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX>, who
was the mainstream conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '70s</TIMEX>, found himself
outflanked on the right by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Safire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Buchanan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Novak</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Krauthammer</ENAMEX>. He was just one smart voice among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX>.

            Like
everyone else on op-ed pages, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX> became just a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twice-weekly</TIMEX>
habit. Now, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 years</TIMEX> of punditry, he has settled into the role of the
institutionalized wise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of journalism, mining quotes for our edification.
(In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just two minutes</TIMEX> of our conversation he squeezed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pascal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aristotle</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Stuart Mill</ENAMEX>.) On television, he can be relied on consistently to connect
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Topic of the Day to</ENAMEX> first principles, to forsake the cheap quip for a
larger point. And despite having written <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</NUMEX> newspaper columns, he (usually)
avoids the dull mediocrity that mires so many regular op-ed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anthony</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen Goodman</ENAMEX> ...). Will is not totally predictable. During the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past four months</TIMEX>, he's written about subjects ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX>
statehood to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unabomber</ENAMEX> to the rape of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanking</ENAMEX>, and only sparingly about
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flytrap</ENAMEX>. His newspaper prose may not be deathless, but it's not as lifeless as
the piled-up clichés that pass for the average column. He is, in short, still
above average. That is: He is mostly, rather than entirely, forgettable. (All
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnists</ENAMEX> wish we could be so lucky.)

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX> says he is comfortable with his place on
the margins. He thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lippmann</ENAMEX>'s influence has been "wildly exaggerated." He
never aspired to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lippmann</ENAMEX> and rejects the idea of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Columnist</ENAMEX>:
"I don't want to live in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> blown about by gusts of wind raised by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX> policy should not be directed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jovian</ENAMEX> thunderbolts from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>. That is not the way a great continental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> should
live." ("A great continental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>"--I love that phrase, but what the
hell does it mean?)

            But there
is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX>'s journalism does seem to matter, where he does toss
thunderbolts: <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Work</ENAMEX> and the columns in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bunts</ENAMEX> are
fresher, less rococo, less pretentious, than his political columns. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Men</ENAMEX>
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Work , Will</ENAMEX> found a smart new way for an average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> to think about the
game. Instead of indulging in the usual teary nostalgia about <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> (that
means you, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Burns</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX> considered it as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX>, explaining exactly why a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> calls a hit-and-run now and not on the next pitch, how a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX> sets
up his fastball, why a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shortstop</ENAMEX> moves in a step for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> kind of double play
and out a step for another. Not terribly analytical about his politics, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX> is
a trenchant rationalist when it comes to hardball.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX>'s baseball writing is so good, in fact, that he's even
being mentioned as a candidate for <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX>. His name has been
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">floated</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few weeks</TIMEX>, as it was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989 and 1994</TIMEX>. He is a long shot:
He lacks business experience, and he alienated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> with his pro-player
stance during the strike. Will demurred when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry King</ENAMEX> asked him about the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX>'s job <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>, and he gave me spin when I asked: He still likes
writing his column, he says, and "it's presumptuous to talk about accepting
something that has not been offered." Which is not exactly a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No.</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX>
Will--it's an appealing idea: He negotiates contracts, he stifles <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>, he
builds <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ballparks</ENAMEX>, he quotes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Bagehot</ENAMEX>.

            And given
that his columns are ephemera, why shouldn't Will give them up for his true
love? He's been opining for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 years</TIMEX>. He hasn't much changed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>. Maybe he
should step aside and let someone else take over the routine. No one would care
that much. After all, he's just a newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX>.
