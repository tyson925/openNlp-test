            Everyone agrees: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s new deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey Weinstein</ENAMEX> is a model of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Media</ENAMEX>--oh, let's use
the word--synergy. There will be a mass circulation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, TV shows, books,
movies based on magazine stories. It will all be hot, modern, a hone to the
cutting edge.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>, and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>, run the prolific and profitable independent movie
studio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Miramax</ENAMEX>. While they may work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TriBeCa</ENAMEX>, drink <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Diet Coke</ENAMEX> and eat day-old
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pizza</ENAMEX> for breakfast, and wear mostly black, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> don't fit the
archetype of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Media honcho</ENAMEX>. They hark back to another, very different
model of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX>: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> studio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mogul</ENAMEX>. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis B. Mayer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Fox</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jack Warner</ENAMEX>--the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> who invented <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>--the
Weinsteins are chutzpah personified, imperious and megalomaniac. This is an age
when more and more studio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> are anonymous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> crunchers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealmakers</ENAMEX>.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bob</ENAMEX> run their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> as a fiefdom, imposing their will on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miramax</ENAMEX> might as well be called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weinstein Bros.</ENAMEX>

            They are emperors with a discerning eye. They invite the
charges of pretentiousness by calling themselves arbiters of "taste" and
"highbrow." But any moron can produce a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tarantino</ENAMEX> knock-off or a bit of Italian
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dreck</ENAMEX> and call it an art <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> masterpiece. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weinsteins</ENAMEX> actually deliver.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miramax</ENAMEX> has been the driving force behind some of the most acclaimed films of
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last decade</TIMEX>: sex, lies, and videotape ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Piano ; Pulp</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiction ; Clerks ; Red ; Il Postino</ENAMEX> ;
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Trainspotting ; The English Patient ; and Good Will Hunting</ENAMEX> .
It has won <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Palmes d'Or</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cannes Film Festival</ENAMEX>'s top prize) and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar</ENAMEX> nominations.

            As the old
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moguls</ENAMEX> came from petit bourgeois <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant families</ENAMEX>, so do the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weinsteins</ENAMEX>.
(They named the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miriam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX>, a diamond <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cutter</ENAMEX>.)
After dropping out of college, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> operated a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-run <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, and promoted rock concerts. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '80s</TIMEX>, they began distributing
small budget films no other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> wanted. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miramax</ENAMEX> took off in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, when a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> poured money into it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinsteins</ENAMEX> graduated from merely
distributing--buying made movies and shopping them to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>--to actually
making movies from scratch. (Distributed movies still constitute <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of
their output.)

            
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weinsteins</ENAMEX>' entry into movie making came at
an ugly moment in cinema history. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> was stagnating in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late '80s</TIMEX>.
Video sales were cutting into box office, and big studio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">execs</ENAMEX> were ever more
cautious. They wedded themselves to focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, obsessed over demographics,
and relied heavily on formulaic action adventures. With the exception of Orion
Pictures, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> retreated from the accessible, carefully crafted
dramas that had built the film industry.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Happily,</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weinsteins</ENAMEX> were a return to form, filling the niche vacated by the major
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> and bucking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> chase, machine gun boilerplate. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX>
possess an old-fashioned, very personal notion of product. They make movies the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> they want. Most studio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> rely on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice presidents</ENAMEX> and vast development
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinsteins</ENAMEX> read scripts and buy films themselves. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey</ENAMEX> won the
nickname "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Scissorshands</ENAMEX>" because of his tendency to chop movies in the editing
room.

            Only in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '90s</TIMEX> did the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> begin to reap big
returns. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, they grossed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250 million</NUMEX> in domestic box office receipts. In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, they raked in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$419 million</NUMEX>. A key to their success: They're cheap. Like
the old moguls, they cut corners and insist on staying within budget. Where
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> spend an average of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$40 million</NUMEX> to make a movie, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miramax</ENAMEX> spends <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$12</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX>. When producing a movie, it eschews expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>. Instead, it uses
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">novices</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Damon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Will Hunting</ENAMEX> ) or revives washouts (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
Travolta, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pulp Fiction</ENAMEX> ). In their distribution deals, the Weinsteins
find genuine bargains. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX> they bought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Smith</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chasing Amy</ENAMEX>
for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250,000</NUMEX> and grossed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$12 million</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> film <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Shall We Dance</ENAMEX>?
came to them for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300,000</NUMEX> and earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$9.5 million</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miramax</ENAMEX>'s success has
attracted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> and spawned imitators: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miramax</ENAMEX> for an estimated
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$60 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> and kept the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weinsteins</ENAMEX> at the helm under a sweet contract.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal</ENAMEX> have launched art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house subsidiaries</ENAMEX>.

            For all
their superb taste, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weinsteins</ENAMEX> really cash in on schlock. Like their '30s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antecedents</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> rely on B-grade genre pics to generate the revenues
to pay for artier films. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miramax's</ENAMEX> subsidiary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dimension Films</ENAMEX>, run by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX>, has
made a handful of sci-fi and horror pics aimed at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX>, such as Scream
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">From Dusk Till Dawn</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mimic</ENAMEX> (a giant-bug flick). Last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dimension</ENAMEX> films brought in nearly the same amount as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> art
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> films <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miramax</ENAMEX> released.

            
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Weinsteins</ENAMEX> don't rely on business school
strategies. They are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hustlers</ENAMEX>. Their aggressive marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machine</ENAMEX> beats any in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>. (Witness their ubiquitous, clever advertising on behalf of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trainspotting</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Crying Game</ENAMEX> .) They promote shamelessly,
pioneering the practice of calling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy Awards</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> to sway their votes.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of their standard devices to garner attention for a film is to pick
high-profile brawls with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motion Picture Association</ENAMEX>, as they did over X
ratings initially given to the films <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tie Me Up</ENAMEX>! <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tie Me Down</ENAMEX>! ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clerks</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kids</ENAMEX> . All went on to make small fortunes at the box
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>.

            They are
similarly aggressive with the press. An example: When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey</ENAMEX> got wind that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time magazine</ENAMEX> planned to reveal the plot twist in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Crying</ENAMEX>
Game --that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> is a transvestite--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey</ENAMEX> called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> times in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a single day</TIMEX>, unsuccessfully demanding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> not
run the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">detail</ENAMEX>. Never mind that the movie had been out for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> and that a
Best <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Supporting Actor Oscar nomination</ENAMEX> had already been awarded for the
portrayal of the female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>.

            Stories of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX>' arrogance and brutality are
legendary. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Variety</ENAMEX> reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey</ENAMEX> once locked a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> in a
Cannes hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> sold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miramax</ENAMEX> the rights to distribute his
film. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortune</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> named them among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> toughest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bosses</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortune</ENAMEX> reported that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> former employee claims <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX> fired
him for making an error at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> softball game. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> was later
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rehired</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX> denies the charge.) There was even a support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mir-Anon</ENAMEX>,
where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX>'s former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> commiserated over wounds inflicted by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brothers</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will Tina</ENAMEX> tame these tough
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX>? In many ways, she seems the ideal match for them, and not simply because
she's an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> at massaging egos. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weinsteins</ENAMEX> all have highbrow
pretensions but feel no shame in embracing pop culture. They all love
attention. But can the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weinsteins</ENAMEX>, who like being the only cocks of the walk,
tolerate a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> as famous and visible as they are? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will Tina</ENAMEX>'s notorious
lavishness irk the frugal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duo</ENAMEX>? Will the snazzy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnership</ENAMEX> produce nothing more
than a TV newsmagazine with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina</ENAMEX> as the talent, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Variety</ENAMEX> has
suggested?

            Who knows? But perhaps
history is on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weinsteins</ENAMEX>' side: It took jerks like the old-time moguls to
bring film to maturity. Maybe it will take jerks like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weinsteins</ENAMEX> to bring
in the golden age of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Media</ENAMEX>.
