            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has left for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vacation</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> may or may not be "moving
on," but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flytrap</ENAMEX> surely remains. The Speech may have guaranteed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
survival, but it won't prevent more testimony by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda</ENAMEX>, a possible
presidential subpoena, a tough report by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>, and congressional impeachment
hearings. So, before 
                  Slate
                heads off on a short vacation of its
own, I propose a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flytrap</ENAMEX> midterm: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> questions to help keep you busy during the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> scandal doldrums. Plenty of mysteries about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flytrap</ENAMEX> remain. Here's your
chance to guess their solutions. (In this test, as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX>, you won't know
the results for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>.)

            

               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> What did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> really know, and when did
she know it?
            

            a) Nothing until he told her
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX>. She truly believed him.

            b) Suspicions all along but
no certainty till <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX>.

            c) Everything as soon as the
scandal broke in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>.

            d)
Everything even before the scandal broke.

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> insist he's building a much stronger case against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> than a
simple sex/perjury allegation. So what is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> hiding up his sleeve?
            

            a) Evidence of obstruction of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">justice</ENAMEX> involving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> gifts and job offers.

            b) Evidence of suborning
perjury involving the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Talking Points</ENAMEX>." (See Question <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.)

            c) Evidence of suborning
perjury in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathleen Willey</ENAMEX> matter.

            d) Lots more nasty details
about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s sex life.

            e) Some or all of the
above.

            f)
Something else altogether.

            

               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> may have denied that he committed
perjury in the Jones deposition, because he believes what he did with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>
did not technically violate the definition of "sexual relations. Well, what did
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> actually do?
            

            a) Oral sex for him, nothing
for her; perhaps skirting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> definition.

            b) Mutual masturbation,
skirting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> definition.

            c) Oral sex for both,
clearly violating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> definition.

            d) Any
other alternative, undoubtedly too icky to be discussed here but clearly
violating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> definition.

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. What
was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, just one, of the questions that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> refused to answer?
            

            Insert
your extremely graphic question here.

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. Who
really wrote the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Talking Points</ENAMEX>?
            

            a) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX>. We mean it.

            b) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>, dictated to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX>.

            c) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Lindsey</ENAMEX>, dictated
to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>.

            d) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Tripp</ENAMEX>.

            e) A
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">handsome</ENAMEX>, mysterious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX>.

            

               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> Why wasn't <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> more contrite and less
aggressive during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">The Speech</ENAMEX>?
            

            a) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> urged him to fight
back, not roll over.

            b) He knew <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> wouldn't
care how apologetic he was, so he decided to take the offensive and win the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>
war.

            c) He isn't sorry and doesn't
think he lied.

            d) All of
the above.

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. Who
made the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> move, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill</ENAMEX>?
            

            a) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX>.

            b)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>.

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. Will
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> stick with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> or ditch him like a hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato</ENAMEX> as soon as he is out of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>?
            

            a) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Stick</ENAMEX>.

            b)
Ditch.

            

               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> How low must <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s approval ratings
sink before <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> pursue impeachment?
            

            a) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 percent</NUMEX>.

            b) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 percent</NUMEX>.

            c) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX>.

            d) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX>.

            e) How
can you be so cynical? His poll numbers are irrelevant. They will impeach him
if he has committed impeachable offenses, no matter how popular he is.

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>. Will
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> tapes ever be released? If so, will they destroy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
reputation?
            

            a) Yes, yes (because they're
so much worse than we imagine).

            b) Yes, no (because we have
already imagined the worst).

            c) Yes, no (because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>
will sound too flaky to take seriously).

            d) No,
no.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">11 Did Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> really believe his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">denials</ENAMEX>? If yes, why? If no, why didn't they quit?
            

            a) No, they really didn't
think it mattered.

            b) No, they didn't want to
embarrass the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>.

            c) Yes, they trusted him
absolutely.

            d) Yes, they never asked.

            e) Yes,
they were willfully delusional.

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>. With
whom did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> plot cover stories to cover up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> affair?
            

            a) With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty Currie</ENAMEX> about
the gifts and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX>'s visits.

            b) With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> about
everything.

            c) With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Lindsey</ENAMEX> about
everything.

            d) With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vernon Jordan</ENAMEX> about
getting her a job.

            e) Any
combination of the above.

            

               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> What is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Lindsey</ENAMEX>'s role in all
this?
            

            a) Knew about affair, did
nothing to help or hinder it.

            b) Knew about affair, helped
hide it from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsiders</ENAMEX> in harmless ways.

            c) Knew about affair, helped
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clean</ENAMEX> it up in questionable ways (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Talking Points</ENAMEX>, etc.).

            d)
Innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bystander</ENAMEX>.

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>. Will
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> subpoena the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>?
            

            a) No, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> got enough on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> to nail him.

            b) No, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> doesn't want to
risk constitutional crisis.

            c) Yes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> ducked too
many important questions.

            d) Yes,
just to annoy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>.

            

               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> is probably constitutionally barred
from indicting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. Whom will he indict in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>
matter?
            

            a) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Lindsey</ENAMEX>.

            b) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vernon Jordan</ENAMEX>.

            c) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty Currie</ENAMEX>.

            d) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Richardson</ENAMEX>.

            e) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Ginsburg</ENAMEX>, just for
the hell of it.

            f) None of
the above.

            
               16.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> knew that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathleen Willey</ENAMEX> were out there. So why
didn't he settle the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paula Jones</ENAMEX> lawsuit rather than risk exposure?
            

            a) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paula Jones</ENAMEX> was actually
lying, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> refused to cave to her blackmail.

            b) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> assumed they would
never find <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Willey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>.

            c) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> assumed they would
find <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Willey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> but also assumed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> would stay
silent, because his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> usually do.

            d) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool</ENAMEX>.

            

               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> permitted the Jones
suit in part because it would not distract the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> from his job. Would
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justices</ENAMEX> have let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> suit proceed if they had known it would produce
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flytrap</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">circus</ENAMEX>?
            

            a) Yes.

            b)
No.

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>. Does
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> really believe oral sex is not adultery?
            

            a) Yes.

            b) No.

            c) "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Well</ENAMEX>,
it's complicated ..."

            

               19 According to some reports, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 40</NUMEX>
percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tripp</ENAMEX>'s testimony was about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flytrap</ENAMEX>. So what was the rest
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX>?
            

            a) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vince Foster</ENAMEX>'s death.

            b) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathleen Willey</ENAMEX>.

            c) Threats by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tripp</ENAMEX>.

            d) Her
secret tapes of other "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>" talking about their sex lives.

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>. What
gifts did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> give <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>?
            

            a) The gold-and-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navy</ENAMEX> tie on
the front page of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> .

            b) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">blue</ENAMEX> tie he wore
during <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Speech</ENAMEX>.

            c) A jack-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">o'</NUMEX>-lantern pin.

            d) A copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vox</ENAMEX> .

            e) Sexually suggestive
tapes.

            f) All of
the above.

            And, for extra credit:

            
               21.
What's on that dress, anyway?
            

            a) Semen.

            b) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Toothpaste</ENAMEX>.

            c) Laundry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>.

            d) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lemon</ENAMEX>-swirl yogurt.

            e) Nothing.

            
               My
guesses, for the record, are:
            

            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1: b</TIMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>:
e; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>: c; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>: anything about the dress; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>: b; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>: b; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>: a; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>: c; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>: b; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>:
