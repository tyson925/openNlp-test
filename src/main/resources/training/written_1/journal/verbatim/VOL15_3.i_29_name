            While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> whose business it is to be witty
often fail to produce, grave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> occasionally
are mirthful when laughter is farthest from their
minds.  From a lifetime of undisciplined reading with
innocent pencil in hand and malice prepense in mind,
I have gleaned a harvest of what I am pleased to denominate
Red Pants items, a sampling of which follows.
My designation derives from a splash of vivid
writing in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Thompson</ENAMEX>'s  <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Corymbus for Autumn</ENAMEX>
in which he proclaims how ‚Äúday's dying dragon‚Äù
was


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panting</ENAMEX> red pants into the West.
            

            In this trousers category, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> must share the
limelight with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coleridge</ENAMEX> by virtue of the line in Kubla
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khan</ENAMEX> :


As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing.
            

            Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelley</ENAMEX> may stake a claim, if only in the pajama
division of this sector, thanks to his description in
Epipsychidion of how


... the slow, silent night
Is measured by the pants of their calm sleep.
            

            Since everthing is to be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>, it is not
surprising that on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> occasions the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> has
contributed his own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Pants nuggets</ENAMEX>.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antony</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cleopatra</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Act IV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scene VIII</ENAMEX>, lines <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">14 et seq</TIMEX> .)  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Antony</ENAMEX>
commands the wounded <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Scarus</ENAMEX> to


... leap thou, attire and all,
Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
Ride on the pants triumphing.
            

            And in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Othello</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act II, Scene I, line 80</ENAMEX>) Cassio utters
the fervent prayer that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Othello</ENAMEX> might

            Make love's quick pants in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Desdemona</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>.

            A variation on this theme occurs in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alba de C√</ENAMEX>©spedes'
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret</ENAMEX> (translated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabel</ENAMEX>
Quigly: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schuster</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX>, page
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114</NUMEX>) where she confides that ‚ÄúI still had a whole afternoon
before me to spend, and I used it to tidy up my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drawers</ENAMEX>....<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  One</ENAMEX> may well wonder what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss Stowe</ENAMEX>
had in mind when, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Tom's Cabin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 5</ENAMEX>),
she narrates how <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúMrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelby</ENAMEX> stood like one stricken.
Finally, turning to her toilet, she rested her face in her
hands, and gave a sort of groan.‚Äù  In this same vein, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mirthless Milton</ENAMEX> adds his bit to the general hilarity of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nations</ENAMEX> when, in describing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Etna</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Book I of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paradise Lost</ENAMEX> (lines <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">236-7</ENAMEX>) he penned


And leave a singed bottom all involved
With stench and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">smoke</ENAMEX>: ...
            

            And in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter VI</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blenkinsop</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housekeeper</ENAMEX>, sought to console <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amelia</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sedley</ENAMEX>'s jilting of her dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rebecca</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thackeray</ENAMEX> confides
(indelicately?)  that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amelia</ENAMEX> wept confidentially on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housekeeper</ENAMEX>'s shoulder ‚Äúand relieved herself a good
deal.‚Äù

            Chuckles often emanate from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> employment
of a term in a sense at variance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
usage.  There is that oft-quoted example, near the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">opening of Trial by Jury</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Defendant</ENAMEX> asks, ‚ÄúIs
this the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of the Exchequer?‚Äù</ENAMEX> and having been
assured that it was, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Defendant</ENAMEX> (aside) commands himself
to ‚ÄúBe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>, be firm, my pecker.‚Äù  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, of
course, do not giggle at this bit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gilbertian</ENAMEX> dialogue,
since to them pecker means `courage,' as in the phrase
‚Äúto keep your pecker up.‚Äù  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the more common
examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British-American</ENAMEX> divergence of usage are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">screw</ENAMEX> and knock up .  In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 39</ENAMEX>), the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">niggardly</ENAMEX> Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pitt</ENAMEX> was not nearly the aerial acrobat
your <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> sophomore might fancy him to be
when he ‚Äúscrewed his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX> by letter.‚Äù  He was simply
making extortionate exactions upon his wretched lessees.
Similarly, when in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter XXXIV</ENAMEX> of the same
novel, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bute</ENAMEX> reminds her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> that ‚ÄúYou'd have
been screwed in goal, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bute</ENAMEX>, if I had not kept your
money,‚Äù she was not speaking of pleasures deferred.  In
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bleak House</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter XXVII</ENAMEX>) Grandfather
Smallweed, referring to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>, warns Mr.
Tulkinghorn that ‚ÄúI have him periodically in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice</ENAMEX>.  I'll
twist him, sir.  I'll screw him, sir.<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äù  In Kipling's The</ENAMEX>
Light That Failed (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter XIII</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torpenhow</ENAMEX> urges
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick</ENAMEX> to attend a party <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that night</TIMEX>, ‚ÄúWe shall be half
screwed before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>,‚Äù is his dismal sales pitch
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick</ENAMEX>.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter VI</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thackeray</ENAMEX> reports
on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Sedley</ENAMEX>'s drunken avowal to wed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Becky</ENAMEX> Sharp the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, even if he had to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúknock up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Archbishop</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canterbury</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lambeth,‚Äù</ENAMEX> in order to have
him in readiness to perform the ceremony.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Great</ENAMEX>
Expectations (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chapter VI</ENAMEX>), we learn how ‚Äú... Mr.
Whopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very bad
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temper</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  And</ENAMEX> who could blame him?

            Many a raucous snigger has been sniggered from
the pure-minded use of a word that suggests unmentionable
parts of the human body.  It does not take a
too-wicked mind to read into such terms meanings of a
lewd nature.  Who can, for instance, blame a youth
with but a mildly evil disposition from guffawing
when he reads in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pater</ENAMEX>'s Marius The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epicurean</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX>) a reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apuleius</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Golden Ass</ENAMEX> noting
that ‚Äúall through the book, there is an unmistakably
real feeling for asses ...‚Äù?  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scott</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Bride of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lammermoor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chapter VII</ENAMEX>), one reads about a boy
‚Äúcudgelling an ass,‚Äù and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> goes back over the passage
to reassure himself that it does not contain a typographical
error for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúcuddling</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> may be indulged a giggle even though he is
sure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isak Dinesen</ENAMEX> did not intend an impropriety
when she recorded in Out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Part V</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) how ‚ÄúFathima's big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">white cock</ENAMEX> came strutting up
before me.‚Äù  And one is certain that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Rexroth</ENAMEX>,
in his <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">American Poetry</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twentieth Century</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herder</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX>) did not intend to hint
at closet biographical matter when, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter I</ENAMEX>, he
wrote that ‚ÄúWhitman's poems are full of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> doing
things together,‚Äù or, later in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, when he
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">referred to ‚ÄúWhitman</ENAMEX>'s joyous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workmen</ENAMEX> swinging their
tools in the open air.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  College</ENAMEX> freshman still read with
flendish glee the first line in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Canto I</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spenser</ENAMEX>'s The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faerie Queene</ENAMEX> (and never mind the title!) that tells
how

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gentle Knight</ENAMEX> was pricking on the plaine.

            In his poem Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> (from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Selwyn Mauberley</ENAMEX> ),
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ezra Pound</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> advises kindly

            Don't kick against the pricks,

            although the identities of the latter are not divulged.

            One is entitled to speculate on what outrageous
proposal the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> had made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Proust</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Remembrance</TIMEX>
of Things Past, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vol. 2‚ÄîCities of the Plain</ENAMEX>
(translated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. K. Scott Moncrieff‚</ENAMEX>ÄîModern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1934</TIMEX>, Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>) to cause the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duchess</ENAMEX> to say,
‚ÄúApart from your balls, can't I be of any use to you?‚Äù
There is a famous letter penned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Brooke</ENAMEX> to
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edward Marsh</ENAMEX>, from somewhere near Fiji
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 463</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Treasury of the World's Great Letters</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simon and Schuster</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX>) in which he relates
how he sends his native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> up a palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, where he
‚Äúcuts off a couple of vast nuts ...‚Äù (macho <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> not
disclosed).  In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Tom's Cabin</ENAMEX> ,
Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Stowe</ENAMEX> offers a dialogue between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haley</ENAMEX> and Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelby</ENAMEX>, part of which goes, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äú `Well</ENAMEX>,' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haley</ENAMEX>, after
they had both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">silently</ENAMEX> picked their nuts for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a season</TIMEX>,
`what do you say?' ‚Äù  In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bleak House</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter XXIV</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX> may cause some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> to blush when he
wrote of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>'s blush that ‚ÄúHe reddened a little
through his brown.‚Äù

            We must move ineluctably to a consideration of
perfectly reputable words which, having acquired sexual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">connotations</ENAMEX>, cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adolescent‚Äîand</ENAMEX> often adult‚Äî
hilarity, even when read by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> of only mildly
prurient mind.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forster</ENAMEX>'s A Passage to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXXI</ENAMEX>) a vivid picture is created by the sentence
‚ÄúTangles like this still interrupted their intercourse.‚Äù
Pages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter XXXVII</ENAMEX>), it is acknowledged that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúHe</ENAMEX>, too, felt that this was their last free intercourse.‚Äù
Apparently from then on, it was going to have to be
cash or credit card only.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Bride of Lammermoor</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter V</ENAMEX>), we are informed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine ‚</ENAMEX>Äúplaced
certain restrictions on their intercourse,‚Äù a limitation
that might have been more usefully set in that same
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob Roy</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chapter VII</ENAMEX>) where we are told of
the chance that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss Vernon</ENAMEX> might be
‚Äúthrown into very close and frequent intercourse.‚Äù

            A variation of this theme is found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Browning</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Flight of the Duchess</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Section</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX>):


‚ÄîNot he!  For in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> they told the elf
Our rough North land was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land of Lays</ENAMEX>,
            

            even though it is generally acknowledged that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">n√∫mero uno</ENAMEX> in this area of human activity.

            More picturesque are the references to erections.
An arresting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> occurs in A Passage to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXI</ENAMEX>) in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forster</ENAMEX> describes a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> as ‚Äúa
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flimsy</ENAMEX> and frivolous erection,‚Äù while in The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casterbridge</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter XVI</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> himself ‚Äúbeheld
the unattractive exterior of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farfrae</ENAMEX>'s erection.‚Äù  A
phrase can paint an astonishing picture for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>.

            Consider <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX>' sharp image in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bleak House</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIV</ENAMEX>) when he describes how ‚ÄúSir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leicester</ENAMEX> leans
back in his chair, and breathlessly ejaculates.... ‚Äù
Or, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Nickleby</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter XLVII</ENAMEX>), where that
admirable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> graphically portrays how old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthur</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gride ‚Äúagain</ENAMEX> raised his hands, again chuckled,
and again ejaculated.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  And</ENAMEX> in his short tale, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lionizing</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edgar Allan Poe</ENAMEX> is quite candid in describing the reaction
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äú ` Admirable</ENAMEX>! ' he ejaculated,
thrown quite off his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> by the beauty of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manoeuvre</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            Alas for perfectly lovely words that acquire pejorative
meanings over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>!  Earlier in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX>,
pansy became a derogatory epithet to describe an effete
male, thereby cheapening forever lines like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelley</ENAMEX>'s
noble image in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Adonais</ENAMEX> (verse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXXIII</ENAMEX>):


His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> was bound with pansies over-blown,
            

            not to mention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poe</ENAMEX>'s odd allusion in For Annie :


With rue and the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puritan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pansies</ENAMEX>.
            

            Or, more slap-stickish, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.F. Benson</ENAMEX>'s action picture in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucia</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 8</ENAMEX>): <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúGeorgie</ENAMEX> stepped on a
beautiful pansy.‚Äù

            Of more recent vintage is gay .  Nobody used to
snicker at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaucer</ENAMEX>'s line (No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5818</NUMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Prologe of</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wyf of Bathe</ENAMEX> , in which that harried dame asks:


Why is my neghebores wif so gay?
            

            In his poem The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menagerie</ENAMEX> , one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vaughan Moody's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> advises:


If nature made you so graceful, don't get gay,
            

            while in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Othello</ENAMEX> (ah, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bard</ENAMEX> again!)  in his dialogue
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desdemona</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emilia</ENAMEX> on the praise of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Iago</ENAMEX> refers to the kind that


Never lack'd <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, and yet went never gay.

(<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act II, Scene I, line 150</ENAMEX>)
            

            And what in the world is one to make of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler Yeats</ENAMEX>'s startling revelation in his poem Lapis
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazuli</ENAMEX> (from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poems</ENAMEX> ) that


They know that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hamlet</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lear</ENAMEX> are gay.?
            

            Indeed it is an amusing, albeit utterly wasteful
pastime to pursue the quest for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Pants</ENAMEX> examples.
May good cess befall all such quixotically misguided
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>!  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> caveat: never assume blithely that an odd

            If you are a fan of old-fashioned jazz‚Äîwhat is now
known as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äútraditional‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äútrad‚Äù jazz‚Äîyou</ENAMEX> are familiar
with one of the standard ‚Äújump tunes‚Äù of the
genre‚Äîa tune most commonly called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Muskrat Ramble</ENAMEX> .
Even if you are not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX>, you must have heard it
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as least a dozen</NUMEX> times.  It is the one that goes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚ÄúDah</ENAMEX>!

That's it; sure; you've heard it.
            

            I think I first bought a recording of Muskrat Ramble
back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1940</TIMEX>, when I was in my early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX>.
My memory is rickety, but I am sure my first recording
was labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MUSKRAT RAMBLE</ENAMEX>, and I think, though I
am less sure, that it was played by the late ‚ÄúMuggsy‚Äù
Spanier, who was, to my mind, one of the greatest of
jazz trumpeters.  Later, I got another recording of the
same tune, this one by, I think, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mezz Mezzrow</ENAMEX>.  The
label said, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MUSKAT RAMBLE</ENAMEX>.  I thought that was surely
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time I had ever seen such an obvious typographical
error in, of all things, a simple title on a
simple <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78</NUMEX>-rpm record.  (This, remember, was in my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>, and it was a time when typographical errors
were called typographical errors, not typos‚Äîat least
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in junior high.)  Some <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> later, I got still
another version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MUSKRAT RAMBLE</ENAMEX>, with still another
version of the title.  This time, it was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MUSCAT RAMBLE</ENAMEX>.
That, I thought, was really absurd.  Not only had they
left out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúR‚Äù</ENAMEX>; they'd changed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúK‚Äù to ‚ÄúC‚Äù</ENAMEX>.  Now, it
made no sense at all.  On the other hand, I reasoned, if
there were, in fact, some sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> called a muscat,
perhaps it wasn't so outrageous.  I looked up muscat in
my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster's</ENAMEX> and found that it is a `variety of grape.'
To name a ramble after a variety of grape seemed to
me preposterous.  I was young and, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s standards,
at least, pathetically innocent.

            During my time in senior high, and, after that, in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Army Air Force</ENAMEX>, I had other things on my mind
(there was a war on, after all), and I didn't give
the MUSKRAT-MUSKAT-MUSCAT RAMBLE problem any
thought.

            Speaking of my time in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAF</ENAMEX>, which was utterly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">undistinguished</ENAMEX>, I think I must make a confession.
Now might be as good a time as any to reveal a
theft I committed at an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Air Force Base</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seymour</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>.  It was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> and bitterly cold.  The wind
used to sweep across that damned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airfield</ENAMEX> with what
seemed an absolute determination to crystallize our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One day</TIMEX> when the wind chill factor was nearing
absolute <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, I took <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX> in the service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>.
There was the omnipresent phonograph, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vic</ENAMEX> , short
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Victrola</ENAMEX>, and the stack of records next to it.  In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> as a rule did not take much care of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phonograph</ENAMEX> records.  Usually the records were taken
from their jackets and loaded naked in stacks, where
they picked up dust, scratched one another, and
traded static electricity.  I was shuffling through a stack
of about fifty records, and I came across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> Bessie
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smiths</ENAMEX>.  I played <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>, and the few other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G.I.</ENAMEX>s in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, which was quite large‚Äîbig enough for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fair-sized</ENAMEX> dance with a small orchestra‚Äîeither paid
no attention or asked me to put on something by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Jimmy</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Dorsey</ENAMEX> instead.  Among
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bessie</ENAMEX>'s numbers were <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dying Gambler's Blues, Sing</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sing Prison Blues</ENAMEX> , and one I had never heard called
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Mountain Blues</ENAMEX> , which has the imcomparable
lines,

            I was, and still am, captivated by ‚ÄúBabies cry for
liquor an' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> sing bass,‚Äù and in the arrogance of
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>, I was certain that nobody else on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airfield</ENAMEX>
either knew or cared who <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bessie Smith</ENAMEX> was, nor
would any other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G.I.</ENAMEX> be enchanted by basso <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, so I
turned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thief</ENAMEX>.  I can't remember how I did it, but somehow
I smuggled those records back to my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX> and
got them home intact on my next furlough.  I kept
them in good shape until my last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78</NUMEX>-rpm turntable
died.

            End of digression and back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MUSKRAT-KAT-CAT</ENAMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muskrat Ramble</ENAMEX> is credited to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward ‚ÄúKid‚Äù Ory</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Gilbert</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúKid‚Äù Ory</ENAMEX> played great jazz trombone.
The only thing I know about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> is that I find him
listed as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-author</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muskrat Ramble</ENAMEX> .

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">About thirty years ago</TIMEX>, when I was concocting an
epicurean <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX> and saw that I had no sherry on hand, I
went to the liquor store and bought a bottle of muscatel
that was being sold for an absurdly low price and
that I thought might be exactly right for my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX>.  It
wasn't bad, The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> jogged my thoughts back to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muscat Ramble</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muscatel</ENAMEX> is made from muscat
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grapes</ENAMEX>, is sometimes called muscat , and, being relatively
cheap and sweet and high in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> content, is
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">booze</ENAMEX> of choice for a great many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>.  An old
college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine who celebrated his twentieth
birthday‚Äîmeaning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX> of AA sobriety‚Äîa
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">couple of years ago</TIMEX>, tells me that when he was on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">skids</ENAMEX> and riding the rails from drunk tank to drunk
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tank</ENAMEX>, the favorite terms for muscat were muscadoodle
and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Napa Valley</ENAMEX> smoke .

            I made up my mind that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muscat Ramble</ENAMEX> was
almost certainly the original name of the tune.  My
reasoning is that it is not likely that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúKid‚Äù Ory</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> had ever seen a muskrat, and it's even less
likely that they or anyone else has ever seen a muskrat
doing anything that we would be likely to think of as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rambling</ENAMEX>.  Muskrats, according to my encyclopedia,
look like giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, are found in and around the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mudbanks</ENAMEX> bordering marshes and quiet ponds, have
partially webbed feet, and do a good deal of swimming.
They do not appear to do much rambling.  Muscat,
or muscatel, on the other hand, is found on skid
rows all over the land.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> with a bottle-shaped
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brown</ENAMEX> paper bag, damp and wrinkled at its upper
end, has almost certainly been slugging down a sweet
wine of high proof, and the odds are pretty good you
would find it is a muscadoodle .  After the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> finishes
his <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Napa Valley</ENAMEX> smoke and has slept it off, he is looking
for the means to get another muscat fix.  Now he is on a
ramble with his hand out and a pleading look in his
roadmapped eyes.  I suspect that that is precisely the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">song</ENAMEX>'s origin.

            My theory is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúr‚Äù</ENAMEX> got put in there simply
because muskrat is a more common word than muscat .
It is the same reason most of us, I assume, have heard,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúHe</ENAMEX>'s in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> with prostrate trouble.‚Äù  Prostrate
is a more common word that prostate , so prostrate is
what we get.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúr‚Äù</ENAMEX> fits in naturally.  I got a strange
sort of corroboration from my good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosy</ENAMEX>
McHargue, who is now pushing eighty-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years</TIMEX> and
has spent most of his life playing clarinet and sax with
some of the best jazzbands‚ÄîBenny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nichols</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Weems</ENAMEX>, and a slew of others.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosy</ENAMEX>, too,
had seen the tune as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muskrat, Muskat</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muscat</ENAMEX> .  I
asked him what he thought the original title was.  He
had known <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúKid‚Äù Ory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX>, and he said, ‚ÄúYou know,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX>, I'm not exactly sure.  I once asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ory</ENAMEX> about it
and he said, `It's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">m-u-s-c-a-t</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muskrat</ENAMEX> .'  So I think that's
just the way everyone said muscat .‚Äù

            There you are.  I find a muskrat ramble difficult to
imagine visually.  I picture muskrats wallowing about
in the mire and paddling sluggishly through the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>,
but I wouldn't call that rambling.  On the other hand,
a wino with an empty paper bag on a ramble to maintain
his muscat level‚Äînow that has a touch of poetry.
Maybe not in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúall the birds</ENAMEX> sing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bass</ENAMEX>,‚Äù but poetry, nevertheless.
         
         

            As a nonexpert, although interested, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscriber</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>, it is ‚Äúa bit mysterious‚Äù to me that the singular
noun absence takes the plural verb are .  I refer to
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> sentence of your article about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman</ENAMEX>
Dictionary [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XV,1</NUMEX>].

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antipodean Newsletter</ENAMEX>



            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Bloomfield</ENAMEX>, having begun with a theory
of meaning which emphasized the environment in
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> were present and named, had to add the
obvious proviso that we sometimes mention what is
not present.  I have lately been reading accounts of the
exploration of the western and northwestern deserts of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australia</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1870s</TIMEX> and I have become very aware of
the effect absent necessities might have on the frequency
of particular items in discourse.  In the desert
the missing necessity is water.  As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">explorer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giles</ENAMEX> put it, the explorer's experience is a ‚Äúbaptism
worse than that of fire‚Äîthe baptism of no water.‚Äù

            My impression was that in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> of desert
explorers the word <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> , alone or in compounds, and
words relating to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, were unusually frequent.  It is,
I suppose, likely that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with little money must
think of money more than the well-off do and that the
hungry will dwell on thoughts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and the thirsty
on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX>.  Here was a chance to quantify such things.  I
decided to make a count of words relating to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in
reports of desert exploration.

            Taking quite at random a single page (page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> recording an early
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1846</TIMEX>) exploration of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> east and north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Perth</ENAMEX>, I
find the word <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</NUMEX> times.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> pages on
(page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>), water occurs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> times but there are also
the related words stream (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</NUMEX>), well (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</NUMEX>), pool,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> , and the circumlocution ‚Äúessential element.‚Äù
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> words, dew and shower , refer in the context to the
presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>; the rest are in contexts indicating its
absence.

            I tried another explorer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Giles</ENAMEX>.  Taking
page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> again, I was reminded that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giles</ENAMEX> is rather
given to semi-serious poetic diction at times, and we
find him referring to the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in the Finke
River as ‚Äúthe stream purling over its stony floor‚Äù or,
quoting some bygone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>, ‚Äúbrightly the brook through
the green leaflets, giddy with joyousness, dances
along.‚Äù  Perhaps present <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> called for some stylistic
celebration.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two hundred</NUMEX> pages further on there is less
exuberance in the circumlocution ‚Äúthat fluid so terribly
scarce in the region,‚Äù and in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other references
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is simply water .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giles</ENAMEX> is not always waxing poetic
and may, like other explorers, be useful as a source
for the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> and general <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  His
use of the word tank to refer to a hollowed-out reservoir
(‚ÄúGibson dug a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> and the water soon
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cleared‚Äù</ENAMEX>) antedates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> , for instance.

            Since this linguistic-statistical study of an obsession
might well prove to be an important contribution
to psycholinguistics, I decided to make a larger sample
of watery words, choosing the straightforward journals
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Colonel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Egerton Warburton</ENAMEX>, who led an expedition
across the western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interior</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1873-4</ENAMEX>.  In a randomly chosen sequence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> pages
(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">151-60</NUMEX> of the published <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>) there were <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty-eight</TIMEX>
occurrences of the word <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of them in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compounds</ENAMEX>), no page being without <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> example.
In addition, there was a rich collection of words
relating to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, not necessarily indicating its presence.
‚ÄúHoping to find a lake‚Äù is included, though of
course it doesn't indicate the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.  Even
words which are usually of more general reference are
brought into relation with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in a text like this.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gum-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> or rocks (in areas of sand) appear as signs of
possible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.  Apart from these words and lake ,
words and phrases directly associated with thoughts of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and reinforcing the sense of obsession include
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">springs</TIMEX>, drainage hole, clay hole, flood, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, water-hole, rock-hole, drink, drinkable,
running <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, stream , and native well .

            The last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> items merit comment.  Stream is often
said not to be used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> except in metaphorical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX>, normally being replaced by creek .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warburton</ENAMEX>'s use: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúsandbanks intercept the stream,
which finally splits into narow water-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> and
spreads itself over the plains, and so it ends as a creek‚Äù
suggests a somewhat more complex relation between
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words.  British-born explorers did not set out to
write <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian English</ENAMEX>, of course.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory</ENAMEX> uses
stream in the way normal in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giles</ENAMEX> consistently
refers to gens in the hills of central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>,
though glen is not current (outside place-names) in
contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.

            The other name, native well is, as a later explorer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Carnegie</ENAMEX>, author of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spinifex</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sand</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1898</TIMEX>),
points out, a misnomer.  He believes native <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> are
essentially rock-holes (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depressions</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX>) buried in
fairly shallow sand, which, when hollowed out by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">natives</ENAMEX>, appear to be <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>.  This sort of misnomer
leads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnegie</ENAMEX> to suppose that ‚Äúto the uninitiated no
map is so misleading as that of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Australia</ENAMEX> where
lakes are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>-bogs without surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, springs seldom
run, and native `<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>' are merely tiny holes in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rock</ENAMEX>, yielding from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0 to 200 gallons</NUMEX>.‚Äù

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnegie</ENAMEX> also describes namma-holes and soaks as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.  Soaks are shallow wells sunk near the
base of an outcrop to tap an underground reservoir.
Namma-holes have been variously described; to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnegie</ENAMEX>
they are <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depressions</ENAMEX> on the surface of rocks, often
with a rounded bottom, where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> are often found,
suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> have something to do with
the formation of the holes.

            Some nostalgic early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australians</ENAMEX> deplored the loss
in our speech of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> country words, the glens and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streams</ENAMEX> (alive, anyway, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> of explorers),
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coppices</ENAMEX> and brooks, woods, becks , and rivulets .  Perhaps
these words did not really fit.  We might have
done better with <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX>.  Wadi , for
instance, would describe an inland creek rather well.
Be that as it may, a later <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">drizzle</ENAMEX> might feel nostalgic when thinking of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parched</ENAMEX> and thirsty but water-obsessed vocabulary developed
in the drier areas of our sunburnt land.

<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter</ENAMEX>, appears somewhat apprehensive at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethelberta</ENAMEX>'s
suggestion.  This apprehension is observed by a
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belmaine</ENAMEX> and mistaken by him for an indication
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neigh</ENAMEX> has been dragged into going to the church
against his will ‚Äúby his over-hasty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  One wonders
whether the marriage had secretly taken place between
the consecutive chapters!  You see, it is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belmaine</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> who was doing the dragging.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Somerset Maugham</ENAMEX> was a good and careful grammarian
but now and then he slipped.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Letter</ENAMEX> , a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">solicitor</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce</ENAMEX>, is approached by a Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crosbie</ENAMEX>:


He spoke beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, accenting each word
with precision, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce</ENAMEX> had often wondered
at the extent of his vocabulary....
            

            Sometimes I wonder about the extent of my own vocabulary,
too, but really, not when I'm interviewing a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX>.

            From <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Once and Future King</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T. H.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">White</ENAMEX>:


Naturally it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lancelot</ENAMEX> who rescued her.  Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boss</ENAMEX>
had managed to find him at the abbey, during his
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX>' absence, and now he came back in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nick</ENAMEX> of time to fight Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mador</ENAMEX> for the queen.  Nobody
who knew him would have expected him to
do anything else, whether he had been sent away in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disgrace or not‚Äîbut</ENAMEX>, as it was thought he had left
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, his return did have a dramatic quality.
            

            Not to say a quality of confusion‚Äîpronoun-cedly so.

            From Oh What a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paradise</ENAMEX> it Seems , by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
Cheever:


The size of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chisholm</ENAMEX>'s teeth, the thickness of his
glasses, his stoop and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> with which he
walked all marked him, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> thought, as a single-minded
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformer</ENAMEX>.  His marriage, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> guessed,
would have been unsuccessful and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
would have difficulty finding themselves.
            

            No wonder ‚Äî we've lost them already.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Twain</ENAMEX> poses us a little mystery in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pudd</ENAMEX>'nhead
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>: which <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">knife</ENAMEX> does the killing?  Quiet now.
Lights, action:


I was asleep, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luigi</ENAMEX> was awake, and he thought
he detected a vague form nearing the bed.  He
slipped the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">knife</ENAMEX> out of the sheath and was ready,
and unembarrassed by hampering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bedclothes</ENAMEX>, for
the weather was hot and we hadn't any.  Suddenly
that native rose at the bedside, and bent over me
with his right hand lifted and a dirk in it aimed at
my throat; but <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Luigi</ENAMEX> grabbed his wrist, pulled him
downward, and drove his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">knife</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s
neck.  That is the whole story.
            

            Well, was it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luigi</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">knife</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX>'s?  If we had only
that scene to go by we would never really know, and
all because of a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Puzzling Pronoun ‚Äîor two</ENAMEX>!


Oh, it can lead <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to a rhymed couplet:

He loves his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>,
Does he live a double life?
            

            Give me my grammatical games <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any day</TIMEX> to a crossword
puzzle.
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Joys and Oys</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>



            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rabbi Robert Schenkerman</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple Beth Jacob</ENAMEX>
            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Bashevis Singer</ENAMEX> was awarded the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Prize for Literature</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>, he remarked
in his acceptance speech:


The high honor bestowed upon me is also a recognition
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish language‚Äîa language</ENAMEX> of exile,
without a land, without frontiers, not supported
by any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, a language which
possesses no words for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ammunition</ENAMEX>, military
exercises, war tactics.

There is a quiet humor in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> and a gratitude
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> of life, every crumb of success,
each encounter of love.  In a figurative way, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>
is the wise and humble language of us all, the idiom
of a frightened and hopeful humanity.
            

            The word <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> derives from the German
judisch `<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>.'  The principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> is
High <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, the form of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> encountered by
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> from northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> in the eleventh
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yiddish</ENAMEX> is written in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> of the
Hebrew alphabet and from right to left and enjoys
borrowing words from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, and
all the other languages and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> along the routes
that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> have traveled during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past thousand years</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Journalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Rappaport</ENAMEX> once quipped, ‚ÄúI speak
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> languages‚Äîall of them <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            Although <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> has been in danger of dying out
for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, the language is spoken <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> by
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> throughout the world‚ÄîRussia, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>,
Rumania, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, where, like the bagel, it was leavened
on both coasts, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>.  It is
spoken even in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transylvania</ENAMEX>: A beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> awakens
in bed to find a vampire at her side.  Quickly she holds
up a cross. ‚ÄúZie gernisht helfen,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> smiles the vampire.
Translation: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúIt won't do you any good.‚Äù

            Most of us already speak a fair amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yinglish</ENAMEX>) without fully realizing it.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s Third
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New International Dictionary</ENAMEX> lists about <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">500 Yiddish</ENAMEX>
words that have become part of our everyday conversations,
including:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cockamamy</ENAMEX> (or cockamamie) `mixed-up, ridiculous.'

fin slang for `<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five-dollar</NUMEX> bill,' from finf, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>
word for `<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>.'

gun moll a double clipping of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gonif</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>
for `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thief</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>.'

kibitzer `one who comments, often in the form of
unwanted advice, during a game, often cards.'

mavin `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX>.'

mazuma `money.'

mish-mosh `mess.'

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">schlep</ENAMEX> to `drag or haul.'

schlock `shoddy, cheaply produced merchandise.'

schmeer the `entire deal,' the `whole package.'

schnoz slang for `nose.'

yenta `blabbermouth, gossip; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> of low
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">origins</ENAMEX>.'
            

            ... and so on through the whole megillah : `<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">long,</TIMEX>
involved story.'

            A number of poignant <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> words defy genuine
translation into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>:


chutzpa `nerve; unmitigated gall;' a quality we
admire within ourselves, but never in others.  In
his delightful study, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Joys of Yiddish</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McGraw-Hill</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leo Rosten</ENAMEX> offers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classic
definitions.  ‚ÄúChutzpa is that quality enshrined in
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, who, having killed his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">throws</ENAMEX> himself on the mercy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> because
he is an orphan.  A chutzpanik may be defined as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who shouts `Help!  Help!'  while beating
you up.‚Äù

mensch a `real authentic human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">being‚</ENAMEX>Äîa <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>.'
naches the `glow of pleasure<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">-plus</NUMEX>-pride that only
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> can give to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>': <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúThis is my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Doctor!‚</ENAMEX>Äù

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oy</ENAMEX> not so much a word as an entire vocabulary, as
Rosten observes: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúcan express any emotion, from
trivial delight to the blackest woe.‚Äù

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oy</ENAMEX> vay; oy vay in mir literally, ‚ÄúOh, pain,‚Äù but, in
its long or short form, can be used for anything
from condolence to lament:

On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 6, 1945</TIMEX>, the world's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> nuclear
weapon was dropped on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiroshima</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>.  Two
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hundred</ENAMEX> and eighty-two <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</NUMEX> human beings
died and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> more were left
burned, maimed, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeless</ENAMEX>.  [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einstein</ENAMEX>,
whose letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roosevelt</ENAMEX> had initiated the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> effort that resulted in the atom bomb
and whose special theory of relativity formed its
theoretical basis, heard the news on the radio.
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> he could only find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>
words traditionally used by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> in such circumstances:
‚ÄúOi vey.‚Äù

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄîThe Little, Brown Book of Anecdotes</ENAMEX>

tsuris the gamut of painful emotions‚Äîsome real,
some imagined, some self-inflicted.
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yiddish</ENAMEX> is especially versatile in describing those
poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souls</ENAMEX> who inhabit the world of the ineffectual,
and each is assigned a distinct place in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> of
pathetic types: schmo, schmendrik, schnook, schmegegge,
schlep, schlub, schmuck, putz, klutz, kvetch ,
and nudnik .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yiddish</ENAMEX> easily coins new names for new
personalities: a nudnik is a `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pest</ENAMEX>'; a phudnik is a `nudnik
with a Ph.D.'  The rich nuances that suffuse this
roll call are seen in the timeless distinction between a
schlemiel `clumsy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jerk</ENAMEX>' and a schlimazel `habitual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loser</ENAMEX>': the schlemiel inevitably trips and spills his hot
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">soup‚Äîall</ENAMEX> over the schlimazel.  (And the nebbish is the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> who has to clean it up.)

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish language</ENAMEX>, through its color, its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>-accurate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expressions</ENAMEX>, its raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">idioms</ENAMEX>, and its sayings
exudes a refreshing magic and laughter, mixed with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sober</ENAMEX> thought, that has been handed down from generation
to generation and from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Yiddish</ENAMEX>
never apologizes for what it is‚Äîthe earthy, wise
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX> of an expressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> learning that life is but a
mingled yarn, good and ill together.

            Which reminds us of the zaftig `buxom, well-rounded'
blonde who wore an enormous diamond to a
charity ball.  ‚ÄúIt happens to be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> most famous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diamond</ENAMEX> in the whole world,‚Äù she boasted.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúThe</ENAMEX> first is
the Hope diamond, then comes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kohinoor</ENAMEX>, and then
comes this one, which is called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lipschitz</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            ‚ÄúWhat a stone!  How lucky you are!‚Äù

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúWait</ENAMEX>, wait,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>.  ‚ÄúNothing in life is all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mazel</ENAMEX> [`good luck'].  Unfortunately, with this famous
Lipschitz <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamond</ENAMEX> comes also the famous Lipschitz
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">curse</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            The other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> gasped and asked, ‚ÄúAnd what is
the famous Lipschitz <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse?‚</ENAMEX>Äù

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúLipschitz</ENAMEX>,‚Äù sighed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>.
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Women's History of the Word</ENAMEX>
            Those who are not familiar with feminist writings
may find it useful and interesting to consider a book,
recently published in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, that is typical of the
harsher brand of such works.  The work in question
offers nothing regarding language, so its review here is
ancillary to the main function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>.  The feminist
movement is very much alive in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúGreenham Common Women‚</ENAMEX>Äù are probably largely
responsible for much of the national sentiment against
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cruise</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> installed at an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> near
that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, as elsewhere, most books by
feminist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> are reviewed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, usually <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> are seldom assigned to review them, possibly
because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> fears that they will be either
ignorant of or unsympathetic to the issues raised, if not
biased against them, or because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.
Because writing an unfavorable review of a (bad) feminist
book would be tantamount to treachery, such
books are often unjustifiably praised, as was the case
with this work by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosalind Miles</ENAMEX>, which was well received
on its publication in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>.

            According to the blurb on the dust jacket of this
distinctly unpleasant book, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosalind Miles</ENAMEX> is head of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centre for Women's Studies</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coventry Polytechnic</ENAMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lecturer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broadcaster</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of
several other books, including a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúhighly acclaimed‚</ENAMEX>Äù
biography of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Jonson</ENAMEX>.  One might like to believe
that this gives her the cachet of authoritative scholarship,
but the text does not bear out the promise.

            For the most part, the book consists of a rewriting
of history, from the dawn of time, with the purpose of
demonstrating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main themes: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúfact‚Äù</ENAMEX> that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were responsible for all the important contributions
to the advancement of civilization (as the development
of agriculture, for instance), often despite
the arrogance and stupidity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>; and the ‚Äúfact‚Äù
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have long been subjected to domination
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles</ENAMEX> suggests that such domination is a recent
phenomenon‚Äîonly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of thousand years</TIMEX>
old‚Äîfor she points to the clear superiority of women
in (primitive) religions and matriarchies, right on
through to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dynastic rulers</ENAMEX>.  At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point,
she gets so carried away with her thesis that she suggests
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> were responsible not only for all of
human evolutionary biology but for the very notion of
counting (in order to keep track of menstruation) and,
probably by the same token, astronomy.  She quotes
(and, presumably, accepts) another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> which holds
that ‚Äúwoman first awakened in humankind the capacity
to recognize abstracts.‚Äù  If you believe that balderdash,
you'll believe anything.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the good old days</TIMEX>, we were taught that the
pyramids were built by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> of slaves.
Recent speculation has it that they were not slaves
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">but‚Äîwhat</ENAMEX> would one call them? ‚Äî ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX>.
Here comes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles</ENAMEX>, authoritatively quoting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diodorus</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX>, who recorded (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60-30BC</TIMEX>) that ‚Äúinnocent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> even swelled the ranks of pitiful slaves
whose forced labour built the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX>:


... bound in fetters, they work continually
without being allowed any rest by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> or day.
They have not a rag to cover their nakedness, and
neither the weakness of age nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s infirmities
are any plea to excuse them, but they are driven by
blows until they drop dead.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>  [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p.49</ENAMEX>]
            

            As the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> were already about 2500 years old
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diodorus</ENAMEX> wrote his <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">World History</ENAMEX> , one is given
to wonder what his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> might have been for such
a vivid description.  It is even less comprehensible how
a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> could accept it and have the effrontery
to promulgate it.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles</ENAMEX>'s book is riddled with
many similar distortions, convenient omissions, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">generalizations:</ENAMEX>


... <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> have always commanded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half</NUMEX>
the sum total of human intelligence and creativity.
From the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sappho</ENAMEX>, who in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixth century</TIMEX> BC
was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to use the lyric to write subjectively
and explore the range of female experience, to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymath</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pan Chao</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ban Zhao</ENAMEX>), who
flourished around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AD 100</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">astronomer</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mathematician</ENAMEX> and educationalist, the range
is startling.  In every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> too numerous to
list were involved in developing knowledge and
contributing to the welfare of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> as they
did so: the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman Fabiola</ENAMEX> established a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
where she worked both as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>, becoming
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> known woman <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX> before she
died in AD 399.  [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p.52</ENAMEX>]
            

            Earlier, on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX>, we learnt about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agnodice</ENAMEX>, ‚Äúwho
lived to become the world's first known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> gynaecologist,‚Äù
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX> BC.  Clearly, this rosily
checkered past was soon to be replaced, chiefly, it
seems, as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Judeo-Christian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX>-Confucian-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX>
cultures flourished.  It was not too bad early on,
when, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Maccabean</ENAMEX> martyrs
who ‚Äúsaved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judaism‚Äù</ENAMEX> did so only at the instigation
of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles</ENAMEX> continues:


In early Christianity likewise, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> found not
merely a role, but an instrument of resistance to
male domination; in choosing to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX> of
Christ they inevitably cocked a snook at lesser male
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fry</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> helped to build
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of God with their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and
bones when frenzied <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX> or fianc√©s
preferred to see them die by fire, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword</ENAMEX> or the
fangs of wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts</ENAMEX> rather than live to flout [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX>]
the duty and destiny of womanhood.  [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p.63</ENAMEX>]
            

            But the situation soon deteriorated:


Even <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Paul</ENAMEX>, later the unregenerate prophet of
female inferiority, was forced to acknowledge the
help he received from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lydia</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seller</ENAMEX> of purple
dyes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippi</ENAMEX>.  [ibid.]
            

            This rewriting of history is punctuated by an array
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-letter invectives applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjectives</ENAMEX> like brilliant, unusual, inspiring , and so
forth to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.  Citing a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Judaic</ENAMEX> law-book of the 16th
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> which identified a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> preceding,
during, and following her period as niddah
`impure,' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles</ENAMEX> has the lack of taste to write the following:.


As a final stroke, in a grim foreshadowing of
what the future held in store for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, the niddah
had to wear special clothing as a badge of her
separate and despised status.  [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p.83</ENAMEX>]
            

            Here and there in this morass of misunderstanding,
Miles treads on solid ground if one can agree with
the eminent anthropologist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Campbell</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX>,
known for his extensive analyses of the world's
mythologies, religions, and cultures, noted the marked
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> emerging from Judaic concepts,
later reinforced by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> doctrine.
Most of the religions of the world connected woman
with mother <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>, fertility, and all the other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progenetic</ENAMEX> and nurturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>, and this was
borne out in the cultures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.  According to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX>, the only godlike female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>
is the Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>, and she appears, identified as virgin,
only in the Gospel according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luke</ENAMEX>.  As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luke</ENAMEX> was
a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> was a carryover
from the paganism of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pantheon</ENAMEX>.
Although this might help explain the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Judeo-Christian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX>
tendencies to subjugate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
treating them essentially as chattel, it does not account
for a similar treatment accorded them in other cultures,
notably that of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>.  It is not entirely clear
whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> was commenting on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hinduism</ENAMEX>,
Buddhism, etc. as they once existed, conceptually, for
it is unlikely that he could have ignored the treatment
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the modern reflexes of the cultures adhering
to those religous precepts.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> held that the ancient mythologies and
religions are allegorical and that there was no real
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">distinction</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between gods</TIMEX> and goddesses, who were
given sexual identity when in human form only to
make them more meaningful.  With all respect, that
seems a highly debatable issue and one far too complex
for this discussion, though we can certainly trace a
diminution in the role of female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divinities</ENAMEX> (or divinity)
when we come to examine Judaism and its congeners
and progeny.  Other debatable aspects are the questions
of whether the debasement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> is a reflection of
the theology or the ritual, whether the scripture of any
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">religion</ENAMEX> should be understood allegorically or literally,
and so forth.  If there is something wrong, it behooves
us to get at the roots of the problem, not to flail about
wildly, for only after the source of a disease has been
identified can one properly investigate its cure.

            ‚ÄúHistory according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosalind Miles‚</ENAMEX>Äù blasts away
at the symptoms in a misconceived notion that alleviating
them will effect a cure of the disease.  In this
jeremiad, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> are viewed as the ‚Äúenemy,‚Äù and are so
characterized throughout the book, which concludes
with exhortations to engage the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foe</ENAMEX> and a strident call
to arms (though not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s).

            Just when you thought it was safe to assume that
we now know all we are ever likely to know about the
past, someone digs another hole and unearths (literally
or figuratively) some ancient artifact: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> it is a
fragile scroll, found in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cave</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dead Sea</ENAMEX>, that
turns out to be pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Biblical</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX> it is an entire
terracotta <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>: the next it is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">skull</ENAMEX>, excavated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olduvai Gorge</ENAMEX>, that compels
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anthropologists</ENAMEX> (once again) to revise their guesses
about the earliest stages of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens sapiens</ENAMEX> vs
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hominids</ENAMEX>.  Most of the relies from the past are gone
forever, destroyed by the plows of countless generations
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>, reduced to rubble by erosion, by conquerors,
by prehistoric (and modern) urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX>, by
fire and flood, and just by time.  Many, we may hope,
have not yet been found.  The interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s forebears
did not become fashionable upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roots</ENAMEX> : on a far larger scale,
we have been trying to discover all we can about the
origins not of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> but of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.  Strange to say, however,
that interest does not seem to be more than a few
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hundred years old</TIMEX>: if the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romans</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> were curious
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about their own prehistory</TIMEX>, I have not heard of it.
Perhaps the fascination with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s past grew out of
the obsession with ruins evinced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romanticism</ENAMEX>; certainly,
modern archaeology seems to have followed
close behind, for the excavation of the supposed site of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Troy</ENAMEX> took place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only about 100 years ago</TIMEX>.  Perhaps it is
just as well, for only by the means available to modern
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science</ENAMEX> are we now able to preserve some of the artifacts
that we find and, through radiocarbon dating,
determine their approximate age.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeology</ENAMEX> is a popular pursuit, and its manifest
results not only receive considerable publicity but can
be seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>.  Not so paleolinguistics, or the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX> of ancient languages.  Even the remnants
we have from early languages that had a writing
system are relatively sparse: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Classical Latin</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>, and a few other languages are better
documented than others; but for most all we have to go
on are a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX> here, a few inscriptions
there, barely enough in many cases to allow us to
identify the language, let alone draw any conclusions
regarding its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> or meaning.  Perhaps <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>
we shall find an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etruscan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, buried deep in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> countryside; but for the present, we have to
make do with what we have, which is precious little.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About</NUMEX> languages that had no writing system, we know
nothing at all.  But some very clever comparative linguists,
beginning in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, theorized
about how the nature of the ancestors of the
more modern tongues.  In some instances, ancient languages
have been decoded, some from multilingual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inscriptions</ENAMEX>.  The work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Francois Champollion</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1790-1832</TIMEX>) in deciphering hieroglyphics from the Rosetta
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone</ENAMEX> was an astonishing accomplishment, for it
enabled us to read the myriad writings of the ancient
Egyptians on papyrus and in wall inscriptions and
revealed an enormous amount of the knowledge we
have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> about their civilization, which lasted for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 2600 years</TIMEX>.  Another significant break-through
was that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Ventris</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1922-1956</TIMEX>), who deciphered
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> B script found on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> and identified
it as an early form of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>.  From the standpoint
of language, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ventris</ENAMEX>'s work was more important, particularly
because it filled in a gap in our knowledge of
the early <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> languages.

            Many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguistic scholar</ENAMEX> counted all of
the languages then spoken of which he had evidence.
The total was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 2800</TIMEX>, but that is probably
only a vague estimate: he undoubtedly missed
some; some have sprung up since his time (modern
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>, for instance); and some have vanished.  The
exact count is unimportant and, at best, spurious, for
it is extremely difficult to establish uniform criteria for
what distinguishes dialect from language.  Then, too,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> must examine the techniques used to group the
many languages of the world.

            Linguists examining <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Classical Greek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Slavic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norwegian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch, Lithuanian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hindi</ENAMEX>, and the other languages
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> found that there were
correspondences among many of the common words.
Some, like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX>,
had more in common with one another than they did
with, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch</ENAMEX>, which, in turn, bore only a remote resemblance
to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX>, on the one hand, and the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extant</ENAMEX> varieties of, say, Gaelic, on the other.  One
rapidly runs out of hands and must resort to fingers
and toes, for after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of laboriously categorizing
these languages, the number of different main
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX> (called <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and subfamilies) came to
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about ten</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingeniously</ENAMEX>, certain differences between
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were explained by various phonetic shifts that
(inexplicably) took place in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> language <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> but
not in another.  Although certain other languages were
geographically nearby, it was impossible to establish
any resemblances between them, hence <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basque</ENAMEX>, for
example, is not classified as being in the same family
with other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> languages, nor are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungarian</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX>, both of which belong to their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
At the conclusion of this vast exercise, done without
the aid of computers, there emerged a pattern of familial
relationships that linked together languages spoken,
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> times, from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> as far east as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turkestan</ENAMEX> and from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> as far north as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lappland</ENAMEX>.  Charts showing the chief languages and
their derivations can be found in many dictionaries‚Äîinside
the front cover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Random House Unabridged</ENAMEX> ,
for example.  Because linguists are constantly
learning more and more about the relationships
among languages, it is best to avoid using an older
chart; for the same reason, it would be wise not to
stake too much on the accuracy of even a current
chart.

            The languages discussed here are what are usually
called the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>; similar family trees
could be drawn for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Semitic</ENAMEX> languages, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sino</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tibetan</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bantu, Malayo-Polynesian</ENAMEX>, and so on.
Each is a distinct phylum; although there may be
word-borrowing among them, lexicon is considered
less important in the classification of languages than
structure and grammar.  It is important, too, to note
that writing systems are irrelevant: for instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polish</ENAMEX>
is written (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>) using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> alphabet, but <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>,
a related <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Slavic</ENAMEX> language, uses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyrillic</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Germanic</ENAMEX> language, is written in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hebrew</ENAMEX> characters;
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanskrit</ENAMEX>, which resemble
one another rather closely in some respects, all use
different alphabets; and early examples, utterly unrecognizable
to untrained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of modern languages,
were written in cuneiform, quite suitable for writing
on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soft clay tablets</ENAMEX> with a pointed stylus, and hieroglyphics.

            
It would be nice to think that while linguists were
working so hard to organize languages, they were
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">working</ENAMEX> alongside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">archaeologists</ENAMEX> who were providing
the raw materials.  But only rarely did they collaborate
and, with few exceptions, their work was not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlated</ENAMEX> in a systematic way.  Schliemann, who discovered
the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Troy</ENAMEX>, used the evidence in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Homer</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iliad</ENAMEX> to determine his digging <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX>, where any ruins
had long since disappeared from view.  In many other
places, the ancient sites lay buried‚Äîand still
do‚Äîbeneath modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>: modern property <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>
quite understandably take a dim view of tearing down
their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> on the off chance that the remnants of
an ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> will be found <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several yards</NUMEX> below.
today, before a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is erected in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archaeological</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> examines the cleared site for its
archaeological significance.  But there, as everywhere
else, nothing can interfere with progress and, regardless
of the finds and their importance, the archaeologist
must eventually yield to the bulldozer.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Notwithstanding,</ENAMEX>
even the brief glimpses afforded by such
investigations can provide some insight into civilizations
that existed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> or, in some cases, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousands</NUMEX>
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years earlier</TIMEX>.

            Based on the sparse evidence available, linguists
theorized about the earlier languages that had given
rise to those attested.  In other words, based on what
they knew about a group of languages which were
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documented</ENAMEX>, they tried to imagine the language that
they sprang from.  In most cases, they dealt with words
and functional elements, creating what are called reconstructions
in hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> prototypes called,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variously</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Proto</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Proto</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proto-Germanic</ENAMEX>,
Proto-Indo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX>, and so forth, the ultimate goal
being to posit a single language called Proto-Indo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>.
That is not entirely true, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguists</ENAMEX> know
too much about language to suggest that there ever
was, literally, a single language from which all Indo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>
languages descended.  Nonetheless, it is convenient
to think about the existence of a group of
proto-dialects which can be referred to as Proto-Indo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>.

            
It seems only natural that once an original language,
or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ursprache</ENAMEX> , was posited, the next step was to
speculate on its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urheimat</ENAMEX> .  That is what
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renfrew</ENAMEX> has tried to do.  Essentially, he proposes that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> of all Indo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> languages was itself
born in central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX>, whence it spread eastward,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">westward</ENAMEX>, and northward, being modified by the influences
of the languages with which it came into contact,
till it ultimately emerged in its recognizable,
modern manifestations which we categorize into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germanic</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hellenic, Italic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Anatolian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Armenian</ENAMEX>,
Celtic, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tocharian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Albanian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BaltoSlavic</ENAMEX>.

            I have no quarrel with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renfrew</ENAMEX>'s theory‚Äînotwithstanding
the generally received wisdom that has
placed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Black Sea</ENAMEX> region
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volga</ENAMEX> steppes.  It is difficult for the nonspecialist
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reader</ENAMEX> (like me) to assess the validity of his arguments,
which are based on his contention that the
language (and its congeners) were carried along by the
spread of nomad pastoralism.  Using the evidence available,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renfrew</ENAMEX> contends that the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indo-European</ENAMEX>
language, closely related to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hittite</ENAMEX>, separated
after 6500 BC, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IE</ENAMEX> languages of western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>
developing from western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX> and those of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> from the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>.
The choice between the prevailing theory and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renfrew</ENAMEX>'s
depends on whether one accepts a ‚Äúwave‚Äù theory,
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> promulgated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a hundred years ago</TIMEX>
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnanes Schmidt</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> linguist, or one of
indigenous development.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pottery</ENAMEX> finds can be interpreted
to support either the imposition of an elite culture
from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkmenia</ENAMEX> or a late development of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indus</ENAMEX> civilization.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renfrew</ENAMEX> accepts the wave theory,
and in the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thirds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Archaeology & Language</ENAMEX>
he sets forth his arguments in its favor.  Unfortunately,
the presentation of his linguistic argument, where the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> is clearly treading on more speculative ground
than in those parts dealing with outright archaeology,
where he is on more familiar territory, is disorganized
and repetitious.  It is difficult to place all the blame on
Renfrew, for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> should have noticed the lack of
coherence.  The result is an argument that is persuasive
but scarely convincing.

            Nevertheless, good books on archaeology assimilable

through the millennia of prehistory in seven-league

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Urdang</ENAMEX>
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronic Thesaurus</ENAMEX>
            This software consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> disks, one labeled
Installation and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Program</ENAMEX>, the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synonym Linguibase</ENAMEX>,
and a manual.  The manual sets forth everything
with clarity, and the program is simple to install, requiring
only <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> thing made me a
little suspicious when cranking up the system: in the
descriptive text that appears on the screen, the word
labeled is <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">spelt ‚Äúlabelled‚Äù‚Äîdecidedly un</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>.
However, I went ahead, and, since I was typing the
text you are reading, returned to the beginning of the
paragraph to see how some of these words would fare.
I looked up the word preceding and was, after a brief
moment, asked to type in the word, which I did.  The
screen bloomed forth with the following:

            Query: preceding

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)  adj being before especially in time or arrangement

            There were also some other parts of speech: one
definition for the preposition and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> for the verb
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">participial</NUMEX>) senses.  I called up the synonyms for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adj</ENAMEX> and the following appeared:

            Synonyms:


antecedent, anterior, foregoing, former, past, precedent,
previous, prior
            

            The way the program works is this: one uses the cursor
to highlight a particular word for which synonyms are
desired.  It is similar, in principle, to finding a synonym
in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">synonym dictionary</ENAMEX> and then looking up its synonyms
to find them.  I am not sure why, but I expected
the program to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúnetwork‚Äù in the same way.  However,
when I highlighted antecedent , what appeared on the
screen was the same list of synonyms but with antecedent
missing, and preceding had reappeared.  If all this
is too complicated to follow, let me summarize: you
look up word <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> and get <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">synonyms A</ENAMEX>, B, C, D, E, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G.</ENAMEX>  You look up the synonyms for word A, and you
get synonyms <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>, B, C, D, E, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G.</ENAMEX>  Even the
definition provided for the sub-listings is identical in
wording to that of the word originally sought.

            This is very economical of space and involves a
clever computer ploy, but it does not provide a particularly
useful synonym dictionary, for, as we all know,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synonymy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> does not yield to the commutative
law of mathematics; in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄúThings equal to
the same thing are not (necessarily) equal to each
other.‚Äù  Perhaps the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Proximity</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> thought that they
had got round that little problem by giving the same
definition for each of the items in the list; but we know
that only very rarely are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> synonyms bi-unique
(which is another way of saying that if A = B, B does
not necessarily always equal A), an ineluctable fact of
language.

            If a relatively limited access to a synonym dictionary
is likely to be of use, then this package may be of
service.  It works with a hard disk or with a set of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">floppies</ENAMEX> and can be used with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> popular word-processing
programs.  (That was the number listed when I
received my copy; it might have increased.)  It also has
a few neat features, like suggesting a few alternatives if
you happen to think that preceding is spelt ‚Äúpreceeding‚Äù
(as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do).  It has a useful ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù feature
that can be called upon at any stage.  Also, if you
enter jump , you get the synonyms for that; but if you
enter jumped , you get the (same) synonyms but inflected‚Äîincluding
the variants leapt, leaped for leap .
All in all, for a relatively primitive system, it is not too
bad; but you would have to be in love with your computer
to use it in preference to a far more complete
books of synonyms available (especially The Synonym
Finder , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rodale</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman</ENAMEX>
elsewhere, which offers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 800,000</NUMEX> synonyms,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than three</NUMEX> times the number listed in any other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synonym</ENAMEX> book).

            The blurb on this book/disk package reads, ‚ÄúSupplies
you with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">470,000</NUMEX> true synonyms for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40,000</NUMEX> entries.‚Äù
My guess is that such a quantity might be
reached if one counted all the permutations and combinations;
in reality, though, there are probably far
fewer actual words.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> can <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> for themselves
the validity of this numerical legerdemain.

            Family Words
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1962</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Speech</ENAMEX> published ‚ÄúFamily
Words in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>,‚Äù by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allen Walker Read</ENAMEX>, which was
reprinted in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">VERBATIM Vol. I</ENAMEX>, No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>).  The article
is a classic, probably the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> on the subject to appear
in a scholarly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>, though there are other informal
references to family language, some of which are documented
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dickson</ENAMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bibliography</ENAMEX>.

            Family words and expressions crop up everywhere.
Some are quite unique and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> cannot
imagine their origin; others, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penn Station</ENAMEX> ,
‚Äúwhat <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> family terms a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s misinterpretation of a

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penn Station</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  Obviously, that works only for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> familiar
with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>.  Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penn Stations</ENAMEX> :


Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>, which art in heaven, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold be Thy</ENAMEX>

exhortation ensuring ample provender for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>.

            This is not to suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dickson</ENAMEX>'s book is a
catalogue of bloopers, or what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amsel Greene</ENAMEX> (and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Smith</ENAMEX>) like to call pullet surprises .  There are
many interesting entries in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Words</ENAMEX> which, as far
as I know, is the first documentation of the genre.
There are occasional hidden entries, as the list of diseases‚Äîamong
them the dread mohogus ‚Äîunder the
entry for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fowlenzia</ENAMEX> .  (In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, some

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fanatics</ENAMEX> who base a slavish purism on a literal
interpretation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Modern English Usage</ENAMEX> .)

            
               Family Words is useful and fun.  Inevitably, some
of the entries are more imaginative than others; Dickson
will have his hands full if everyone responds giving
private words.  Please sent yours to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, c/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o Addison-Wesley</ENAMEX>,

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Midwesterner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will Hays, Jr.</ENAMEX>, who is proud of
his knowledge of post-Civil<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-War</ENAMEX> history, tells me the
following origin of shot , as in shotglass , absent from
‚ÄúGunning for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language‚Äù</ENAMEX>:

            Although we associate trench warfare with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War I</ENAMEX>, trenches were characteristic also of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil</ENAMEX>
War.  A scaffold was built so that a rifleman‚Äî
who fired a single-shot, muzzle-loading shoulder
weapon‚Äîcould step up and shoot over the top of the
trench.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX> in charge would command, after
each firing, that the rank on the scaffold step down
and be replaced by the rank that had just reloaded,
thus alternating ranks and sustaining the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifle</ENAMEX> fire.

            That war, like others, produced disgruntled veterans
and those more adventurous or more restless after
military service.  They moved westward to start a new
life.  The population increased markedly, with corresponding
demands for goods and services, among them
the need for saloons.  Most new saloons were small and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> short, accommodating with difficulty the
many bunched up, in ranks, if you will, calling for
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">whiskey</ENAMEX>.  Many of the thirsty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX>, as
were many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bartenders</ENAMEX>.  Thus, ‚ÄúStep down (or
back) and give me a shot‚Äù was readily understood.  I've
not been able to corroborate this explanation, but I'll
never forget it.




         
         

            Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Hymes</ENAMEX>' ‚<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">ÄúDo Mistake‚ÄîLearn Better‚</ENAMEX>Äù
[XV<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX>] brought to mind the time a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> acquaintance
told me of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of hers who decided to tackle
the original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> version of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> books she had
enjoyed while in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>.  She boldly marched into a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bookstore</ENAMEX> and asked the salesclerk for a copy each of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sun Come Up Again and Throw</ENAMEX>
Away the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gun</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinbeck</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Angry Grape</ENAMEX> .  Is
there a term for the errors that creep in while translating
a passage back into the original tongue?




         
         

            Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davidson</ENAMEX>'s observations on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottishness of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers 20th Century Dictionary</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XV,1</NUMEX>] bear out
my own formed over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen years</TIMEX> of using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.  An odd
sidelight on this came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX> after reading the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX>.  Definitions under pet end with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúPetting Party</ENAMEX>
(coll.) a gathering for the purpose of caressing as an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">organised</ENAMEX> sport.  (Origin unknown; not from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gaelic)‚Äù I</ENAMEX>
think it hardly fanciful to discern a note of Calvinist
disapproval in this curt disclaimer.




         
         

            Although I greatly enjoyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Lederer</ENAMEX>'s article,
I fear that one of his paragraphs is a load of brass
monkey balls.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> on board <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lad</ENAMEX> employed to
fetch supplies‚Äîpowder and so forth‚Äîto the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>.  The
word might also have been used for a receptacle near
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">powder</ENAMEX> and balls were kept.  However,
this receptacle would have taken the form of a wooden
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">box</ENAMEX> or something similar.  The idea of a metal stand
carrying a pyramid of cannon balls so delicately balanced
as to be affected by the tiny differential expansion
of brass and iron does not bear thinking about in a
heavy sea.

            So what is the explanation of the phrase cold
enough to freeze the balls off a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">brass monkey</ENAMEX> ?  Well,
the obvious one, I believe.  Anybody who asks ‚ÄúWhy a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">brass monkey?‚Äù</ENAMEX> is probably not aware that brass monkeys
were very common household ornaments in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 20th centuries</TIMEX>.  Originally,
they were probably imported from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, but were
later mass-produced in places such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Birmingham</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grace Victorian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edwardian</ENAMEX> mantelshelves.  They
can still be found <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in so-called ‚Äúgift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Usually</ENAMEX>,
they come in sets of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, one with its hands over
its eyes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> over its ears, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> over its mouth: they
were said to represent ‚ÄúSee no evil, Hear no evil, Speak
no evil.‚Äù  There were various whimsical variants.




         
         

            I am sure I am not the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to point out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joseph</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hynes's</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúDo Mistake‚</ENAMEX>ÄîLearn <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better,‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XV,1</NUMEX>] mistakes

nain not ‚<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Äúnine-o.‚</ENAMEX>Äù  The possibilities for representing
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> with a language of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only forty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> syllables
are not that numerous, and the rules are very consistent.
The main problems are representing consonant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX> and word-final consonants.  These difficulties
produce such monstrosities as sutoraike for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
`strike'‚Äîone syllable in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>.

            Every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veteran</ENAMEX> has his list of favorite mistakes.
Mine are the ones that are possible, but wrong,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  Adding the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> final vowels produces
Gone with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windo</ENAMEX> .  Hypercorrection, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> learn that many final vowels do not exist
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> version of the tongue and so remove
them, sometimes incorrectly, gives us the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisk</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sacrament</ENAMEX> .  This process
resulted in the sign reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pizz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coffee</ENAMEX> .

            My absolute favorite of these semantic mistakes,
however, does not come from the problem of sound.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> has a verb inflection which expresses causation
or permission‚<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Äîin English</ENAMEX>, ‚Äúto make someone or
to let someone do something.‚Äù  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One day</TIMEX> during a university
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> class, a very discomfited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>, after
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frantic</ENAMEX> and obtrusive dictionary work, handed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX>
of mine a scrap of paper.  On it was written this

            You Could Look It Up
            As everyone in the world must know by now, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Safire</ENAMEX> writes a column in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York Times</ENAMEX>
Magazine called <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúOn Language</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  Considering the circulation
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York Times</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX>, his column
is probably the most widely read commentary on
contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> in the world; that places more
than one uncommon burden on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>: he must do
his utmost to be accurate; he must try to select subjects
likely to be of interest to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>; and he must
write well.

            Those familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safire</ENAMEX>'s editorial style, reflected
in his political columns on the editorial pages
of The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. Y. Times</ENAMEX> , may agree with me in the contention
that when he writes about language he seems to
be writing on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his day</TIMEX> off: I cannot put my finger on
why, but ‚ÄúOn Language‚Äù always strikes me as an excruciating
effort to be cute.  In part, that is attributable
to the designation of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondents</ENAMEX>, who
keep him informed on language that is not within
earshot, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúLexicographic Irregulars</ENAMEX>,‚Äù an amusing
reference the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time or two it was used but now
beginning to cloy.  More often than it might prove of
interest to me, personally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safire</ENAMEX> deals with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insiders</ENAMEX>'
language in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> (where he is based) or with
trivialities uttered by some politico.

            As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Norman</ENAMEX> wrote, in a letter published in
this book on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113</NUMEX>, ‚ÄúYou flit freely back and forth
between prescriptivism and descriptivism.‚Äù  But are not
many of us guilty of that?  We are descriptive of the
usages we accept and prescriptive‚Äîperhaps proscriptive
would be more descriptive‚Äîof those we do not
like.  At least <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Safire</ENAMEX> expresses an opinion; whether the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reader</ENAMEX> agrees with him is another matter, as are the
questions of his accuracy, which arise fairly often, and
that of the suitability of his style, which, as far as I
know, has not been broached before.  It ill behooves
me, excoriated recently as enamored of the ‚Äúcheap
larf,‚Äù to criticize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safire</ENAMEX>'s arch puns, which permeate‚Äî‚Äúenliven‚Äù
is probably the word his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> would
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">use‚Äîhis</ENAMEX> articles, but I find some kinds of humor unsuitable
for reading, however they might evoke a
chuckle when uttered viva voce .  A handful of examples,
from the book at hand:


Therefore, I stand uncorrected. [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p. 112</ENAMEX>]

...‚ÄúGet your hand off my knee.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX>  (That's a mnemonic,
pronounced knee-MONIC.)

Ize Right?  [title, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 114</ENAMEX>]

[on -logue vs. -log:] Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> prefer their
logues sawed off...[<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p. 123</ENAMEX>]

But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> wants to be non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> [in
its spelling of -logue words].  [ibid.]
            

            Writing containing such labored figures makes for
hard reading.  I am interested in what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Safire</ENAMEX> has to say
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> language but find myself stymied: I get the feeling
that he has deliberately created a minefield of
interruptions in thought through which I must pick
my way to the end.  Notwithstanding the valuable role
he plays in inspiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nonlinguists</ENAMEX> to think about language
and in informing them about myriad facets of
the subject, I find it hard slogging (or, as he would
probably write, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúsloguing‚Äù</ENAMEX>).

            
               You Could Look It Up is the umpteenth collection
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safire</ENAMEX>'s columns and, like the previous collections,
contains a selection of letters from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>.  It is those
that are so sorely missed in his column.  True, there is
an occasional mention in his column of a point raised
by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Letters</ENAMEX> section of the
Magazine prints a comment from time to time, but an
important feature of the books is their inclusion of far
more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer-reader</ENAMEX> interaction than one might suspect
from reading the column alone.  For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing, the
letter-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> call attention to errors or misinterpretations
and are largely critical.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Safire</ENAMEX> cannot be accused
of being copy-proud (except, evidently, of awful puns,
as in ‚Äú <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ms.</ENAMEX> is deliberately msterious , but at least it is
not deliberately msleading ‚Äù and other mscegenations).

            There is no gainsaying that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safire</ENAMEX> is one of the
most influential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> on contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, and
it is essential that his books be in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> of all
who are interested in the subject, regardless of their
alignment with his opinions.  For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing, he documents
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neologisms</ENAMEX>, an activity that endears him
to many working lexicographers.  From the sometimes
cavalier manner in which he treats his subject, one
wonders if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Safire</ENAMEX> feels the burden of the responsibility
he has toward his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> sent unrevised bound proofs from
which this review was prepared; unfortunately, there
was no proof of an index, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> has assured
me that there will be one in the published book, a
rather essential ingredient of a work with this title.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New World Guide to Current American</ENAMEX>
Usage

            Here is a commonsense style book, useful to those
who have the education and common sense to be in
doubt about questions of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> usage.  It has some
problems, if you want to be sticky about things: on p.
xv we read:


...<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einstein</ENAMEX>'s Special Theory of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Relativity</ENAMEX> does
not say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E = MC¬≤</ENAMEX> and in leap <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> MC¬≥.
            

            Indeed it does not.  But it does say E = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mc¬≤</ENAMEX> ; the version
with the capital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> is, essentially, meaningless
to those familiar with the conventional symbolism used
in physics.

            While I acknowledge that it is not easy to know
how to sort out the many topics to be covered in a
usage book, most reasonable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> have taken a stab
at writing an entry under a heading that seems a likely
place to look, then have provided a detailed index.  Not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernice Randall</ENAMEX>.  True, one can find different from ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>, in an entry so headed, but for absolute constructions
one is referred to an entry called <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúCovered</ENAMEX> with
onions, relish, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ketchup</ENAMEX>, I ate a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hotdog</ENAMEX> at the ball-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> wants to find out about misplaced
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adjectives</ENAMEX> and adverbs , reference is made to the entry
‚ÄúElectric shaver for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with delicate floral design
on the handle.‚Äù  A search for only would be futile.

            Perhaps the subject and treatment of usage need
some lightening up, but I am hard put to agree that
they are quite as frivolous and light-headed as this
book would have us believe.  Fun is fun, but those who
might rely on such a book are quite serious about the
information they are seeking, and it is unfair to play
fast and loose with their sincerity.  A sense of humor
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about</NUMEX> a subject is born of a feeling of security about it,
but security is the one characteristic often lacking
among those who would use <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Current American Usage</ENAMEX> .

            There is no doubt that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randall</ENAMEX> enjoys her work.
But of what use is a long entry on spoonerisms?  And of
what use are the interminable examples, for instance,
of the misuse of like for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as</TIMEX> , which draw out the entry
to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> pages?  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than four</NUMEX> pages are devoted to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clich√©s</ENAMEX> (under the guise of ‚ÄúLo and behold, it's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s
best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>.,‚Äù which, being an exclamation, really
ought to end in an exclamation point).  The article on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British/American English (‚ÄúThere</ENAMEX>'s no home like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eaton</ENAMEX>
Place.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>) is a good one, but, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> pages, its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> is
questionable.  In the matter of pronunciations of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrEng</ENAMEX> names, it is an old-fashioned fantasy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brits</ENAMEX> go round saying POM-frit for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pontefract</ENAMEX> :
most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brits</ENAMEX> that I have heard give the name a
spelling pronunciation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>; and so with many of
the old shibboleths.  Of what relevance (to usage, notwithstanding
the fact that the topic is interesting) is an
entry on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">eponyms (‚ÄúJohn Bull</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John Hancock</ENAMEX> are
not just any johns.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>)?  That is not, strictly speaking, a
subject pertinent to the title of the book.

            All of which is to say that the book is an interesting
work on the language and contains accurate,
though longwinded information about what it covers,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúinteresting</ENAMEX> and useful facts about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
Its only real faults are its title, which belies the content,
the cutesy headings, and the lack of a truly detailed
index: self-indexing does not provide coverage of
sufficient detail.  As a reference work on usage, it is far
from complete: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simon and Schuster Publicity Department</ENAMEX>
could have used an entry on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">foreword</ENAMEX>/
forward (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spelt ‚Äúforeward‚Äù</ENAMEX> in the release accompanying
the review copy).

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loose Cannons</ENAMEX> & Red Herrings

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> should be familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Claiborne</ENAMEX>'s
earlier books, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Our Marvelous Native</ENAMEX>
Tongue: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX> .
One might say that subtitling the present book ‚ÄúA
Book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">of Lost Metaphors‚</ENAMEX>Äù is an example of a loose
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">canon</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX>] ‚Äî unless metaphor is taken in its broadest
sense‚Äîbut one is unlikely to find red herrings here: the
etymologies of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few hundred</NUMEX> words and phrases are
given, many not readily findable in standard works of
reference.  The rationale behind referring to them as
‚Äúlost‚Äù arises from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s observation of an unfortunate
state of affairs: because of an increasingly widespread
lack of familiarity with the basic, structural
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> of our culture‚ÄîGreek and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> mythology,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>, literature, and ordinary historical
fact‚Äîpeople <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> are unable to discern the origins of
terms like aphrodisiac, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achilles</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX>] heel or tendon,
meet one's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waterloo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sow dragon</ENAMEX>'s teeth , and hand-writing
on the wall , to name a few.  There are many, of
course, but unaccountably, they are not the focus of
this book.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Claiborne</ENAMEX> investigates and reports on expressions
like sow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one's wild</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oats</ENAMEX> , about which he tells us little
or nothing: the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Latinate designation Avena</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fatua</ENAMEX> came too many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> after the original expression
to have any relevance to it, so why bring up
the information that fatua is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> for `foolish': it was
also <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> for `wild,' which might be more to the
point.  In any event, it is hard to discern, from the arch
style affected in an attempt to make dull facts interesting,
just what is the origin of sow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one's wild</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oats</ENAMEX> .  In
many entries, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Claiborne</ENAMEX> labors the obvious, offering
little or nothing we do not already know, could easily
imagine, or for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> offers no explanation.
Among examples of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> are spit and polish,
on the spot, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, stick one's neck out , etc.
Examples of the last include spill the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX>, square the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circle</ENAMEX>, stalemate , etc.  Between these is an occasional
flash of useful wisdom, much of it pretty well covered
by other books of this type (which seem to be proliferating).

            What is missing, for example, at square the circle ,
is the information that because the area of a circle is
mathematically calculated using pi , which is irrational,
there is no mathematical way of calculating the
dimensions of a square with the same area as that of a
given circle.  But that does not mean that such a square
cannot exist.  As for stalemate , which is related to
checkmate , would it not have been important to indicate
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">- mate</ENAMEX> part has nothing to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>,
having been borrowed from checkmate which is a
loanword from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian</ENAMEX> (and has nothing to do with
check , either).

            Often, an entry offers nothing in the way of etymology
and merely explains the meaning.  Does any
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> need an entry like this one?

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">straddle</ENAMEX> .  When you straddle a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>, you've got
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> leg on either side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>.  When a
politican straddles an issue, he's in much the same
position.

            Some speculative suggestions, as the derivation (or
reinforcement) from Seidlitz <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">powders</ENAMEX> for take a powder
are sheer nonsense.  Not all entries contain misleading,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dull</ENAMEX>, or incorrect information, but those that do
not are marked by a lack of originality.

            Word Maps

            Dialect geography, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of dialectology, describes
certain features of the dialects of a language
and their distribution.  The field is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 100 years old</TIMEX>.
Most prominent among its earliest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Wright</ENAMEX>, who prepared the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-volume
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">English Dialect Dictionary</ENAMEX> , which was published
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1898 and 1905</TIMEX>; the best-known contemporary
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Orton</ENAMEX>.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>,
work proceeded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>, largely under
the direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raven McDavid</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Kurath</ENAMEX>, and,
later, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Allen</ENAMEX>; more recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Pedersen</ENAMEX> and
others have investigated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX> dialects.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1948 and 1961</TIMEX>, fieldworkers based at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leeds</ENAMEX> conducted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Survey</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Dialects</ENAMEX>,
which studied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">313</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">localities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> (which,
as everyone ought to know, does not include <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wales</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>).  The present book is extracted from the two
major works that resulted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Survey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Linguistic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlas of England</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Word Geography</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>), both under the direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold</ENAMEX>
Orton, aided by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanderson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Widdowson</ENAMEX> in the latter
effort.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> generally seem to find dialect study interesting.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> letter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Times</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 June 1988</TIMEX>]
reported:


Our close neighbour... in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bere Regis</ENAMEX>, who was
born in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> and who speaks with a delicious
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorset burr</ENAMEX>, always uses <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚ÄúI‚Äù</ENAMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúme</ENAMEX>.‚Äù...

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúWell</ENAMEX>, it makes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> for I and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> for
she.‚Äù  Another of his happy expressions is inner-wards,
meaning `since,' as in...‚ÄúI chucked him
out the door and he's not been back innerwards.‚Äù
            

            Another reported [same date]:


Let's get it right.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bristol</ENAMEX> for ‚Äúme‚Äù is not ‚ÄúI,‚Äù
but ‚Äúoi.‚Äù  When I was teaching there, the explanation
invariably given by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> brought to me for
scrapping in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> was: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúEe it oi, so oi
it ee.‚Äù
            

            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> maps selected for representation from the
Survey yield information on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> words,
some of which are clear variants, others quite different
lexical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>.  For instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Map 34</ENAMEX> shows the areas,
marked off by boundary lines, where the variants
chimley chimbley, chimmock, chimdey, chimbey , and
chimney occur.  Map <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> shows the distribution of child
(most of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>) and of bairn (north of a
slightly wavy line between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wash</ENAMEX> to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lancaster</ENAMEX>, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">west coast</ENAMEX>).

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have provided a brief introduction
which is easy to follow, a list of suggested readings,
and the names and addresses of the several institutions
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> may indulge a
more intensive interest in dialect study.  The maps are
clear, each occupying a full page, and the word information
is well set forth on them.  Where necessary,
brief but not cryptic explanations are provided of any
information that might seem to be out of the ordinary.
I have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> nit to pick with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>.  In their
description of isoglosses , they write:


These are drawn to run midway between/
localities which were shown by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Survey</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Dialects</ENAMEX> to use the different words or
pronunciations which are the subject of the map.
            

            Although it is true that isoglosses, in effect, set off the
various areas where a particular usage was recorded,
more accurately an isogloss is drawn to connect sites
either where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> employ both usages or where
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> using one or the other live in very close proximity.
Hence, the term isogloss , from iso - `same' + gloss
`word,' to describe the line on a map where the terms
are of equal distribution.  Isoglosses are to dialect maps
what isobars and isotherms are to weather maps, what
isobaths are to geophysical maps of the oceans, etc.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> are not alone in getting this wrong: it is
incorrect in some dictionaries.

            In those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> where dialect study is undertaken,
dialectologists observe that there are today
many factors militating against the strict maintenance
of older dialect boundaries: the standardization of terminology
as adopted by national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">periodicals</ENAMEX>, news
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>, radio, and television; the establishment of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúprestige‚Äù</ENAMEX> dialects and, through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">promulgation</ENAMEX>; and the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> shifts that
have taken place, particularly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>.
Such shifts have been somewhat slower in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>,
but seem now to be speeding up.  There are many
other, lesser factors at work, but taken together, all
tend toward standardization, especially as the older
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> die off.  In some respects, it may not be long
before certain aspects of dialect geography will be
largely historical.  The importance of dialect is emphasized
regularly in the press, where we read about people
being killed, as in parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, because they use
the wrong shibboleths.

            This book is a good introduction to the subject (in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX>); those familiar with dialectology in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, and those interested in the study in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>
or, indeed, generally would be well advised to add
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Word Maps</ENAMEX> to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>.

            These are supplemented by an extensive Bibliography
and a detailed Index.

            As can be seen from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter headings</ENAMEX>, some of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> is trivial, but nonetheless interesting for
that.  It is not at once apparent why the book is styled
an <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúalmanac,‚</ENAMEX>Äù but that is unimportant: there is no
other book I know of that contains as much diverse
information about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> as this one.  Its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">readability</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> make it suitable for
browsing‚Äîeven for reading straight through‚Äîso in
that respect, at least, it does not resemble books in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúOxford Companion‚</ENAMEX>Äù series.  It contains many photographs
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, some quite early; these enliven the
appearance of the book but accomplish little else, unless
one is interested in what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Clemens</ENAMEX> looked
like at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 15</TIMEX> (as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">printer</ENAMEX>'s devil) or in the
appearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hart Crane</ENAMEX> standing in the middle of a
railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1916</TIMEX>.

            It is difficult to make any sensible connection between
the lives of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> and their creations.  A handful
might have led colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">existences</ENAMEX>, some are objects
of interest because they died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early</TIMEX>, committed suicide,
were related to (other) famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, and so forth;
but such information seldom reveals as much about
their output as do the creations themselves, and in
certain cases one is probably better off not knowing
quite so much.

            This book appears to have been diligently researched
and has much to recommend it as an adjunct
to most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and private, large and small,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX> and specialized.

            I would like to make a couple of comments on
articles in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Autumn 1988</TIMEX> issue [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XV,2</NUMEX>].  Re the article
on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuthbert</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX> uses intercourse to mean `communication
between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">in A Christmas Carol</ENAMEX>
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scrooge</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúI</ENAMEX> will not be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> I must have
been but for this intercourse‚Äù to the third <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Spirit</ENAMEX>.

            I would think that the words grand and stretch
would be known to more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the words
the author gives as being familiar ( chippy and hootch ).

            Incidentally, I seem to recall reading somewhere
that skins as slang for `dollars' dates from frontier days
when trappers used animal skins as currency, and is
therefore much older than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlem</ENAMEX>.
