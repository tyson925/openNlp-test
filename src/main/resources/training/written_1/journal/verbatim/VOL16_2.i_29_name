               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord</ENAMEX> is my shepherd; I shall not want

               He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: He
leadeth me beside the still waters.

               He restoreth my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>: He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for His name's sake.

               Yea though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou
art with me: Thy rod and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> they
comfort me.

               Thou preparest a table before me in the presence
of mine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>: Thou anointest my head with
oil; my <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cup</NUMEX> runneth over.

               Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of my life: And I will dwell in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> forever.

               -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Version</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1611</TIMEX>.

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord</ENAMEX> is my shepherd; I shall want nothing.

               He makes me lie down in green pastures, and leads
me beside the waters of peace;

               He renews life within me, and for His name's sake
guides me in the right path.

               Even though I walk through a valley dark as
death, I fear no evil, for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thou</ENAMEX> art with me, Thy
staff and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crook</ENAMEX> are my comfort.

               Thou spreadest a table for me in the sight of my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>.  Thou hast richly bathed my head with
oil, and my cup runs over.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodness</ENAMEX> and love unfailing, these will follow me
all the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of my life: and I shall dwell in the

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford University Press</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>.

            

            Stupid me!  I always thought that there was only
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> translation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">23rd</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Psalm</ENAMEX> until the other
day when I happened on the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New English Bible</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>)
and saw that â€œmy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> was richly bathed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>,â€
â€œBathed in oilâ€?  Odd!  I remembered â€œanointed.â€  Is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anointing</ENAMEX> `bathing'?  I couldn't find such a definition in
the thesaurus.  I looked up the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> word, dishanta .
Found no `bathed.'  It bothered me, this image of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">man</ENAMEX> having his head bathed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> in a very French
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">barber</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> (where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> have their heads massaged in
oil to prevent baldness) instead of the image of the
making of a king, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX>, who was the anointed of
God.  Why did this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX> feel he had to change
â€œanoint his headâ€ to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œbathe his headâ€?  Perhaps the
translation comes from some very important commentator
but it hardly creates a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œsublimeâ€</ENAMEX> image and
surely does not achieve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quiver</ENAMEX> mentioned in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brough</ENAMEX>'s translation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanskrit</ENAMEX> poem:

Of what use is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>'s poem,
Of what use is the bowman's dart,
Unless another's senses reel
When it sticks quivering in the heart?

            

            Nor does the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psalm</ENAMEX> sing as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Ward</ENAMEX> Beecher
put it in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œLife Thoughts</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€ â€œlike a nightingale</ENAMEX>...of
small homely feather singing shyly out of obscurityâ€
filling...â€œthe air of the whole world with melodious
joy greater than the heart can conceive.â€

            What were the translators of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New English</ENAMEX>
Bible thinking?  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> tell us, â€œThe translators
have endeavored to avoid anachronisms and expressions
reminiscent of foreign idioms.  They have tried to
keep their language as close to current usage as possible
while avoiding words and phrases likely soon to
become obsoleteâ€; a most ambitious and delicate program
to attempt for the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>.  And how does it
apply to the 23rd Psalm?  Isn't the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">metaphoric</ENAMEX> shepherd
an anachronism to a television <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>?  And
what of â€œanoint his headâ€?  No one does that anymore--not
even in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> where there are still occasional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coronation</ENAMEX> ceremonies.  Are â€œwaters of peace,â€
â€œvalley dark as death,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€ â</ENAMEX>€œthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and thy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crook</ENAMEX>,â€ current
usage?  I miss the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX>'s search for the quiver
and the nightingale!

            That started my own search.  What had other
translators done with this â€œsunny little psalmâ€ that
â€œhas dried many tears and supplied the mould into
which many hearts have poured their peaceful faithâ€?
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maclaren in A. Cohen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Psalms</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>)

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">From One Language to Another</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">1986) Jan de</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene A. Nida</ENAMEX> decry the â€œclinging to old-fashioned
language even though the meaning has radically
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">changedâ€</ENAMEX> and as a deplorable example points to
the retaining of â€œThe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lord</ENAMEX> is my shepherd, I shall not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wantâ€</ENAMEX> even though want no longer means to `lack' but
rather `desire' and continues with, â€œThus many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
understand this traditional rendering to mean, `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lord</ENAMEX> is my shepherd whom I shall not want.'  Can you
believe it?  Can it be that these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> are wanting in
judgment?

            Perhaps it is because I am just one of the â€œordinary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> with no special knowledge of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Eastâ</ENAMEX>€
[<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New English Bible</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>] that I want more than anything
else â€œa quiver in my heartâ€ when I read the 23rd
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Psalm</ENAMEX> and confess to being rather shocked to find that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œthe Lordâ</ENAMEX>€ is no longer my shepherd.  Writes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX>
[ The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Psalms</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>]: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œI abolished `the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX>' but
felt unwilling to call God, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yahweh</ENAMEX>.  I know no one who
actually prays in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> to that name.â€  I know many
who pray to the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œmy Lordâ€</ENAMEX> and some who are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œwillingâ€</ENAMEX> to pray to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almighty</ENAMEX>, to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Eternal One</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">God</ENAMEX>'s ineffable name as told to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX>
is unutterable [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Exodus 6</ENAMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>] so why make an issue of it?
Why not choose the one that is closest to the nightingale?
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Version</ENAMEX> chose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œThe Lord</ENAMEX> is my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shepherdâ€</ENAMEX> and it sings!  That liquid â€œLâ€ sounded with
that almost awe-full <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œ-ordâ€, â€œLLL-AWE-RDâ</ENAMEX>€ followed
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soft â€œshâ€</ENAMEX> in shepherd and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œrdâ€</ENAMEX> alliteration
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œrdâ€</ENAMEX> in lord entwine this twosome in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>.
Isn't that what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œthe Lord</ENAMEX> is my shepherdâ€ is all
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX>--entwining my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>?

            Is it a better translation for me because each word
is perhaps a trifle closer to the original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hebrew</ENAMEX> or to
the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ugaritic</ENAMEX> stem?  When I read the psalm
what I want is that quiver in my heart.  Do I get it
when <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">â€œI</ENAMEX> shall not want,â€ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> simple <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-syllable
words, swaying in iambic rhythm, with the shall sliding
irresistibly into the breathy w of want calling up
the memory of God's â€œbreathing the breath of lifeâ€
[<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Genesis 2</ENAMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> becoming a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œliving soulâ</ENAMEX>€ is â€œimprovedâ€
to â€œI shall lack nothingâ€ with its jagged k
sound, its materialistic, vacuous nothing , or changed
to â€œI have everything I needâ€ to which â€œWell, whad-daya
know!â€ can be the only response?

            Recognizing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> translation is
â€œThe noblest monument to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> proseâ€ [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> Annotated
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bible</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1962</TIMEX>], many translators, in prefaces to
their â€œnew,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€ â€œmodernâ€</ENAMEX> versions have written apologetics
explaining why they felt they had to retranslate and
how they proposed doing it.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Psalms</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX> writes in his preface,
â€œI have tried not to substitute without necessity
new <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> phrases for what was old and well-loved,
but unity and modernization of language as well as the
true meaning of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hebrew</ENAMEX> have often made changes inevitable.â€
Is â€œHe will bring me into meadows of young
grassâ€ really any closer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hebrew</ENAMEX> than â€œHe maketh
me to lie down in green pasturesâ€?  Is not â€œHe maketh
me to lie down in green pasturesâ€ old and well-loved?
Does the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> really lack the great â€œeruditionâ€
necessary to be able to understand a few old
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words and forms--What about â€œMy country
'tis of theeâ€? -- and is it indeed true that, in the rather
awkward phraseology of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œthe</ENAMEX> language
is not altered with doing without thou and theeâ€?  Not
altered?  For my quiver I prefer doing with thou and
thee!  The loving yet formal thee and thou and the
closing -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eth</NUMEX> syllable create a melody, a rhythm, a
smooth cadence truly reflecting our beloved shepherd's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>, and ignite a feeling of intimacy with him, a
mutuality of feeling that the -s ending completely
wants<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">--Excuse me</ENAMEX>! --lacks.

            Just compare the overtones and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> of the
psalm with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-th</ENAMEX> and the -s endings:


-s ENDING   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OVERTONE        -th ENDING   OVERTONE</ENAMEX>
He makes                 `forces me'     He maketh                 `persuades
me                                       me                        me'
He leads                 `holds a        He leadeth                `I follow
me,                      tight rein'     me                        willingly'
My cup runs              `a coffee cup   My <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cup</NUMEX> run-               `fulfillment:
over                     in a dirty      neth over                 a goblet,
                         <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saucer</ENAMEX>'                                   maybe a
                                                                   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grail</ENAMEX>'

            

            To my ears, restores my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX> with its - z sound in
the middle of the alliteration is irritating and divisive,
while the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-th</NUMEX> in restoreth my soul smoothly slides
along, bringing the alliterative - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">s</ENAMEX> 's together, etherealizing
the restoring and uniting it with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>.  Besides
the acoustically melodious vibrations of restoreth my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">soul</ENAMEX> , its imagery holds that transcendental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredient</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>, while refresh my being [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>], revive my
drooping spirit [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>], gives me new strength [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>],
renews life within me [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>], or renews my life [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>]
are all soulless images arousing only mundane connotations.

            â€œKeeping abreast of the times and translating into
the language we use <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> slogans wisely
adopted.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€</ENAMEX>  [ <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Testament of the Jerusalem Bible</ENAMEX> ,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>].  What is so â€œwiseâ€ about it?  The worshipers of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Calf</ENAMEX> were keeping abreast of the times,
and the language we use <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tower of Babel</ENAMEX>
from which elegance and sublimity seem to be deliberately
omitted.  This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX> has replaced â€œHe leadeth
me beside the still watersâ€ by â€œTo the waters of repose
he leads me.â€  What are â€œwaters of reposeâ€?  Are they
abreast of the times?  or are they the â€œlanguage of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">todayâ€</ENAMEX>?  Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX> may not â€œsubstitute his
own modern images for the old onesâ€ how can the
shepherd metaphor retain its old-fashioned pastoral
simplicity when its sense and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>'s senses are
jarred out of the authentic <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>-time setting and are
forced into a frame of the â€œlanguage we use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">todayâ€</ENAMEX>?
Seen any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shepherds</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX> lately or even mentioned
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York Times</ENAMEX>?
            

            Are not visual images-made-modern pedestrian,
colorless substitutions?  â€œThough I pass through a
gloomy valley, I fear no harmâ€ is like â€œThough I pass
through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wichita</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a rainy day</TIMEX> on the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>,
I won't have an accident in my automobileâ€; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œYea,</ENAMEX>
though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
death, I will fear no evilâ€ is no casual passing by but
step-by-step pacing through life with death constantly
threatening and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">devil</ENAMEX>'s evil lure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contemned</ENAMEX>, reminding
us of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Adam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX> who, tempted by the
devil, were enticed and ate from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evil</ENAMEX> (not harm!) [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Genesis 2</ENAMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>].

            Most of our modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translators</ENAMEX> seem to be allergic
to or very much afraid of death or else have little real
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">faith</ENAMEX> in the shepherd's taking care of them as they walk
through life to ultimate death.  In the following outline
of thirteen psalms translated since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX>, the preoccupation
with darkness and the elimination of any
reference to death is conspicuous.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> word
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circumvented</ENAMEX> and about which there is some commentary
discussion is zalmaveth, zal meaning `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shadow</ENAMEX>'
and maveth meaning `death,' the combination translated
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Version</ENAMEX> as â€œthe shadow of
death,â€ a quivering image.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DATE   REFERENCE</ENAMEX> TO dark       REFERENCE TO death

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>   the valley of deepest darkness       eliminated

            

            Is it at all possible â€œto balance the lofty beauty of
the heavily nuanced text with an easily understood
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Englishâ€</ENAMEX>?  [ <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siddur Kol Yaakov</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>] Is â€œI shall not
lackâ€ any easier than â€œI shall not wantâ€?  â€œtranquil
watersâ€ easier than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œstill watersâ€</ENAMEX>?  a â€œvalley overshadowed
by deathâ€ simpler than the â€œvalley of the shadow
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">deathâ€</ENAMEX>?  <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œtormentorsâ€</ENAMEX> easier than â€œenemies,â€ and
â€œlong daysâ€ easier than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œforeverâ€</ENAMEX>?  Just what is easily
understood <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>?

            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translators</ENAMEX> have set themselves an almost
transcendental goal -- to answer the question, â€œWhat
thought did the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who first recorded these words
really intend to express?â€  [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish Publication Society</ENAMEX> ,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>]  That is a thought to conjure with.  What did
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> (or was it someone else?) intend when he wrote
or sang the 23rd Psalm?  How can we ever know exactly
what he intended?  And does it really matter?  Whatever
the original intention, however literally exact the
translation, it misses, unless it sticks quivering in the
heart.

            In an essay published recently in a history <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> substituted â€œfoul upsâ€ for the correct
term I had used in referring to certain incidents witnessed
during army <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>.  For quoting a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam-</ENAMEX>era
line of graffiti, â€œFighting for peace is like fxxxing (my
cryptic spelling throughout) for chastity,â€ the witty
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">columnist Molly Ivins</ENAMEX> was blasted in a long letter to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Progressive</ENAMEX> .  In contrast, we have the
story about the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten-year-old</TIMEX> who, caving in to the
nagging of his ever-suspicious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>, admits
that his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> did indeed let slip a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œdirtyâ€</ENAMEX> word
( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">shmuck</NUMEX> ) on their fishing trip, but won't quote it:
â€œWhat I can tell you is that it rhymes with fxxx.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€  And</ENAMEX>
there is the story of the touching letter in a shaky script
from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ninety-year-old</TIMEX> in the nursing home, thanking
the community service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for the gift of the transistor
radio with ear-piece that freed her from having
to share the radio of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX>, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamady</ENAMEX>, and
now she can tell Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamady</ENAMEX> â€œto go fxxx herself.â€

            My interest in the life and times of the word stems
directly from a recollected bit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army business</ENAMEX> during
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1942</TIMEX>, a bizarre directive came
down from on high, one of a kind in the memory of
army â€œlifers,â€ or regulars.  Issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lt. General</ENAMEX>
MacNair, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U. S.</ENAMEX> ground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>, it
stated that less authoritarianism and greater courtesy
must thenceforth characterize all orders to enlisted
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, and it closed with â€œthe day of the shouting sergeant
is over.â€  It was to be read to all formations.  Our
regimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> used the opportunity to append
an order of his own to all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>-grade officers
to make special efforts â€œforthwithâ€ to eliminate the use
of obscene language in their commands.

            As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junior officer</ENAMEX> in charge of an infantry medical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detachment</ENAMEX>, this assignment was mine.  On a
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">muggy morning</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Camp Livingston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX>, the
regular business of reveille completed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6:30</TIMEX>, I read
out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General MacNair</ENAMEX>'s directive.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œAny</ENAMEX> questions?â€

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œQuestion</ENAMEX>, sir!â€

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œYes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sergeant Willard</ENAMEX>.â€  This was an â€œoldâ€ national
guardsman of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>, a barker, heart and soul of the
outfit.

            â€œMay I say, sir,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> shouting, â€œthat when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of
the shouting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sergeant</ENAMEX> is over, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> will
have died, sir!â€  preceded and followed by the snappiest
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">salute</ENAMEX> in that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX>.

            â€œThank you, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sergeant Willard</ENAMEX>.  Now -- any questions?â€

            Nothing but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grinning</ENAMEX> faces.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œI</ENAMEX> will now read the
order of the regimental commanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>.  Subject:
obscene language.  To: All regimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>.â€
There followed a paragraph linking decent language
and decent conduct.  I wound up with, â€œYou know
what that means.  From now on, the fxxx word is taboo
!  Dismissed!â€  No questions solicited.

            Perhaps <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three seconds</TIMEX> of perfect silence.  Then the
dam burst.

            â€œTaboo you, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thorp!â</ENAMEX>€

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œWhere</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taboo</ENAMEX>-up Metcalf?â€

            â€œYou're asking for it, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taboo</ENAMEX>-face!â€

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œDelgado</ENAMEX>, get this tabooing <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> report to
regimental!â€

            It became a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nearly three years later</TIMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1945</TIMEX>, I arrived
as a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P.O.W.</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stalag</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV B</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Muhleberg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany</ENAMEX>,
part of a battered lot of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> trapped and finally taken <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX> in the
Battle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bulge</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stalag</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV B</ENAMEX> housed mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>
enlisted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about seven thousand</NUMEX> at the time, and
though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> never attained the notoriety of some
other grim stalags, it entered the literature unnamed
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Slaughterhouse</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> , the novel by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Vonnegut</ENAMEX>.
The portrayal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> and the reception by the
British <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P.O.W.</ENAMEX>s, camouflaged though it is, is so vivid
that on reading it when it appeared in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>--and
since--I have found myself transported back there,
frozen feet and all.


...out marched <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> middle-aged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Englishmen</ENAMEX>.

They were singing, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œHail, Hail the Gang</ENAMEX>'s all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hereâ</ENAMEX>€
...These lusty ruddy vocalists were among the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> English-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> to be taken in the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX>.  Now they were singing to
nearly the last...The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Englishmen</ENAMEX> were clean
and enthusiastic and decent and strong...They
were adored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>, who thought they
were exactly what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Englishmen</ENAMEX> ought to be.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Englishmen</ENAMEX> had never had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> before and
they went to work like darling elves, sweeping,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mopping</ENAMEX>, cooking, baking...

There was silence now, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Englishmen</ENAMEX> looked
in astonishment at the frowzy <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> they had so
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lustily waltzed</ENAMEX> inside...â€œMy God, what have
they done to you, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lad</ENAMEX>?  This isn't a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.  It's a broken
kite!

            The take-charge <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> dazzled us, as
they had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vonnegut</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy Pilgrim</ENAMEX>.  Bedraggled, starving
and exhausted after a final <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</TIMEX> crushed in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">box</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, we were, I learned later, the most disheartening
lot of ragmen they had seen in their more than
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> of imprisonment.  Responding in the tradition
of trained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British â€œranks</ENAMEX>,â€ they radiated full responsibility,
herding us to plank tables, scurrying
about like a choreographed swarm of caterers.  Their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boots</ENAMEX> were polished and their worn tunics had all their
buttons.  These were the remnants of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tobruk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tobruk</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North African</ENAMEX> desert, in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year 1941</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Allies</ENAMEX> were losing the war!  To me,
they were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creatures</ENAMEX> from a lost planet, another world.
They served us <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œKlimâ€</ENAMEX> tins, and a cracker each.
They indulged our incoherent questions and smiled
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reassurances</ENAMEX>.  They returned us to life.

            An impeccable, moustachioed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sergeant Major</ENAMEX>
MacMahan, gaunt like all the others, wearing the beret
and polished insignia of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scots</ENAMEX> regiment, stood
erect as a flagpole at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one end of the barrack hut surveying</TIMEX>
it all, the angel in charge.  To his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy</ENAMEX>, carefully
doling hot water from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a canteen cup</NUMEX> into a row of
small tins, he snapped, â€œMind the measuring now,
there's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty-fxxxing</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> to serve 'ere!â€

            I heard it.  Whatever my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> till then, I knew I
was not now hallucinating.  That was the first I had
ever heard the word used as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œbridge</ENAMEX>.â€  It was snapped
out loud and clear, after the fashion of the proper
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX>, with none of the slurring so characteristic
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> using it as an adjective.  (Compare
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œy'r</ENAMEX> fxn well toldâ€ with â€œyou're fxxxing well told, ole
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">boy!â€</ENAMEX>) I was in no condition to be charmed.  But impressed--I
was forever impressed.

            After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX>, befriended and coached by these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX> of a different time and a different kind of war,
most of us revived enough to make do behind the
barbed wire in the blighted landscape.  Assigned after
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some weeks</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> per week in the makeshift
dental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> revier or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, I took to
busying myself during the great gaps of empty time by
searching out and putting on paper <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX>-language
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specials</ENAMEX>, like mucker `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>,' scoff `overeat,'
fluff `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>,' skilly `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX>,' griff `rumor,' duff `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX>.'
Most numerous and engaging by far were the novel (to
me) uses of the ubiquitous, all purpose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-American</ENAMEX>
word fxxx .

            Hearing of my hobby, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison â€œeditorâ€</ENAMEX> paid a
visit.  With a willing little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of helpers he periodically
put out the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison â€œnewspaper</ENAMEX>.â€  This was a wall
poster containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">innocuous</ENAMEX> camp news items, all
painstakingly penned by hand.  A new issue was unveiled
to a hungry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readership</ENAMEX> about once every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>.  The suggestion by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Hurst</ENAMEX>, that
I work up my lexicon on fxxx for the forthcoming issue
was a great boost.  I felt a sense of real purpose in
mining for new specimens in conversations with these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old â€œkriegiesâ€</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P.W.</ENAMEX>s) from almost everywhere in the
world where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King's</ENAMEX> and everyone else's <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> were spoken.  I was also the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">beneficiary</ENAMEX> of
special contributions from numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX>
who had never previously felt the pull of scholarship.

            Reviewing our completed lexicon, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hurst</ENAMEX> and his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> pronounced it a respectable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of work,
acceptable for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>.  It never
made it, however.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Just one week later</TIMEX>, elements
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Marshal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Konev</ENAMEX>'s 1st <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ukranian Army</ENAMEX> liberated the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">camp</ENAMEX> and to our great joy, the world of the prison
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">newspaper</ENAMEX> ceased to exist for us.

            Though the manuscript remained out of sight yellowing
in a footlocker for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43 years</TIMEX>, the work was never
completely out of mind, recalled on occasions when
some special item caught ear or eye.  For example,
there was the title of the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">film</ENAMEX> of the
1970s, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dirk Bogarde</ENAMEX>, I'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allright</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fuji</ENAMEX>-yama ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lexicon</ENAMEX>), and the name borne by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutique</ENAMEX> in
downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œSweet Fanny Adamsâ€</ENAMEX> (see
Sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fxxx</ENAMEX>-all , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lexicon</ENAMEX>).  Special mention should be
made of the fact that there are some items in this
lexicon similar to those in the classic <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Unconventional English</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Partridge</ENAMEX>
(8th <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edition</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>), which first appeared in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX>.
Luckily for the lofty sense of purpose which infused
and inspired us, none of us knew of its existence then.
Except for the elimination of several redundant items,
this is the lexicon produced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>.

            The origin of the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ViÃªt/YuÃ©h</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XV,2</NUMEX>] is similar
to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saxon</ENAMEX>.  The name of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, first seen in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shang</ENAMEX> dynasty oracle bones (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2nd millennium</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX>),
the earliest complete <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> script known, is a pictograph
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">yuÃ©h `axe</ENAMEX>,' which may be symmetrical or
asymmetric, stone or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze</ENAMEX>.  As with many place
names, the pictograph was later arbitrarily ornamented
with various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX>--Ã¬ `a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>' or tz\?\ `walking,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migrating</ENAMEX>.'  The form ornamenting yuÃ¨h with tz\?\
became accepted.  The word thus formed coincidentally
also means `to exceed, to pass, large, more, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>!,'  but I simply can't figure out why anybody would
translate it as `extreme.'

            How did <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">MÄ›i-KÃºo become Me Gook</ENAMEX>?  I suggest
some tin-eared grunt heard the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ViÃªt Namese</ENAMEX> pronunciation

thought he heard.



         
         

            Recent communications by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henn</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XIV,3</NUMEX>], Cragg
[XV<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powers</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XV,2</NUMEX>] on the origins of `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gook</ENAMEX>' have
led me to research the matter.  While I agree with
Cragg that â€œthe word is extraordinarily derogatoryâ€
and can understand <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powers</ENAMEX>' confusion with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henn</ENAMEX>'s explanation,
I still believe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henn</ENAMEX> has the best explanation
for the origin of the word.

            To begin with, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henn</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mee Gook</ENAMEX> apparently is
both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cantonese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX>!  As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powers</ENAMEX> correctly observes,
the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> as spoken on the mainland
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> has `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Meikuo'</ENAMEX> (pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MÄ-gwÅ</ENAMEX>) as the
word for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> characters
taken individually mean `beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.'  However,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stimson</ENAMEX> and others have pointed out that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> phonology
does change with time and that the Old Mandarin
pronunciation for `<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>' had a final â€œkâ€ sound
unlike modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> as now spoken on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and
the mainland.

            The languages of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> were greatly influenced by
the language of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>.  Also the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œdialectsâ€</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Min</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taiwanese</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cantonese</ENAMEX>,
to name just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, show varying relationships
with the dominate tongue.  It is by studying these various
phonological relationships that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinologists</ENAMEX> have
come to better understand the ancient forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>;
this is analogous to our studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>.
If we chart some of the pronunciations of the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> the relationships become more apparent.
(I give <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Chinese</ENAMEX> though
there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four or five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">transliterations</ENAMEX> currently
in use.)

            I have no <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX>, but
it seems clear to me that the guk of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX> Myguk
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cragg</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quoc</ENAMEX> are all derived from
an earlier form of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>.  (I have ignored all notations
of tone since they would not affect the analysis.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> example is from the word quoc-ngu
which I understand to be the same as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kuoyu</ENAMEX> = `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">National Language'</ENAMEX>)

            It is at this point that another problem arises.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson</ENAMEX> gives no entry for bi-koku `beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'
(`The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States of America</ENAMEX>').  In fact the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
for `The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States of America</ENAMEX>' is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beikoku</ENAMEX> = `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>-country.'
This brings <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amerigo Vespucci</ENAMEX> into the
picture.

            Consulting my <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Tz'u Hai</ENAMEX> (tz'u `word or phrase' +
hai `sea' = â€œa sea of words/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">phrasesâ€</ENAMEX>), I discover that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">meikuo</ENAMEX> is actually short for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">mei-li chienho-chung-kuo</NUMEX>.
The mei from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mei-li</ENAMEX> = `<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>' and
the kuo from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chien-ho-chung-kuo</NUMEX> = `<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>(ly)-enclosing-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>'
= `<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.'  In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson</ENAMEX>, a few
entries after beikoku, I read that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meriken</ENAMEX> means
`<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>,' that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> for `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>' in this case is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pronounced â€œMeâ€ not â€œbei</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€  Backtracking</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
dictionary I find that mei-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">li</ENAMEX> comes from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ya-mei-lichia</NUMEX>.
In other words:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amerigo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>) = <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Americus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>) thus to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> [the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX>] = <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ya-Mei-Li-Chia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">= â€œA-Me-Ri-Kaâ€</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> possible <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sino</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pronunciation</ENAMEX>) = <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">â€œA-Bei-Ri-Kaâ€</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>).  The
first, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> are the same in
both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> characters
differ.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> for `beautiful,'
in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> for `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX>.'  The phonetic nature
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sino</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>) is demonstrated
again!  [See my letter in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XV,2</NUMEX>.]

            

            Based on the above I believe that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henn</ENAMEX> is
probably correct in attributing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gook</ENAMEX> to an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East Asian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mee Gook</ENAMEX>, for all of the area by the time of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>'ang
was culturally if not politically under the sway of the
Central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chungkuo</ENAMEX>).



         
         
            As a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutchman</ENAMEX> living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake City</ENAMEX>, I could
not agree more that â€œEnglish Is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crazy Languageâ</ENAMEX>€
[XV<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX>].  I was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holland</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1923</TIMEX> and received my
education there, including senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">high school</ENAMEX>.  Learning
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English grammar</ENAMEX> and building up a vocabulary
was not the hardest part for me in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, but it was
difficult to learn to speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> without a heavy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch</ENAMEX> accent.

            In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haarlem</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> by the
name of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G. Nolst TrenitÃ©</ENAMEX>, who also wrote articles
under the pen name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charivarius</ENAMEX>, published a little
booklet entitled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Drop Your Foreign Accent</ENAMEX>.  In it was
printed a poem called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œThe Chaos</ENAMEX>,â€ which as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Albert Wilson</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scholar</ENAMEX> on Whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Shaw Tried</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Grind His Alphabet Axe</ENAMEX>



            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than half</NUMEX>-a<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century ago</TIMEX> a book written by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Albert Wilson</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1874-1949</TIMEX>), stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Shaw</ENAMEX> to write what
was probably his major sally into alphabet reform.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Saskatchewan</ENAMEX>, and during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirties</TIMEX> he
gave a course on the origin and development of language.
Following good professorial custom, he worked
his lecture notes into a book which was published in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dent</ENAMEX>, under the title, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Birth of</ENAMEX>
Language , with a subtitle, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Its Place in World Evolution</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Its Structure in Relation to Space and Time</ENAMEX> .  I
was in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn of 1937</TIMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> sent a copy of the book to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaw</ENAMEX> as â€œan
instalment of interest on an old debt.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€  Shaw</ENAMEX> read it
and responded enthusiastically: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œI</ENAMEX> urged as strongly as
I could the reprinting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s treatise in a
modestly priced edition baited for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> book
market with a preface by myself: an overrated attraction
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">commercially</ENAMEX>, but one which still imposes on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publishers</ENAMEX>.â€  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941</TIMEX> Dent re-issued the book as a
Guild paperback at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">one shilling</NUMEX>.  This edition, of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX>, baited with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>-page preface by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaw</ENAMEX> and a
souped-up title, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Miraculous Birth of Language</ENAMEX> ,
sold out rather quickly.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1942</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dent</ENAMEX> issued a hardcover edition of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paperback</ENAMEX>, and that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> I, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian</ENAMEX>
Army, saw it displayed in a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bookshops</ENAMEX>.  A bookseller in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charing Cross Road</ENAMEX> told
me that he was amazed that such a dry book sold so
well, especially in wartime.  I reported this in a letter
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>: it seemed to amuse him, and he sent me
a small fruitcake that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>.  The new edition was
widely reviewed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.B.S. Haldane</ENAMEX>, the eminent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> who was then in his heyday as a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Marxist</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intellectual</ENAMEX>, was provoked by the word miraculous in
the title to flex his dialectic muscles at it in a lengthy
review in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rationalist Press Annual</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX>: as I
remember, he dismissed it as a nefarious supernaturalist
plot.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1946</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guild</ENAMEX> paperback was re-issued,
and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philosophical Library</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, provided
an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> edition, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaw</ENAMEX> effusion,
and under the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Miraculous</ENAMEX> title.

            The preface begins with this characteristically
Shavian sentence: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œThis book by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> is
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in which I should like everyone to be examined
before certified as educated or eligible for the franchise
or for any scientific, religious, legal, or civil employment.â€
(Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> that has assured me that I was
splendidly qualified--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> gave me a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œBâ€</ENAMEX>--for my
religious employment after my ordination in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX> to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ministry</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Church of Canada</ENAMEX>.)  In the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">preface Shaw</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> was not known to him
when he received the book.  He commented: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œI</ENAMEX> learned
that it (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s professorial chair) was at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saskatoon</ENAMEX>, a
place of which I had never heard, and that his university
was that of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saskatchewan</ENAMEX>, which was connected in
my imagination with ochred and feathered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>
rather than with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> apparently <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX>
ahead of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> in science and of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> in common
sense.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX>  (In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1914</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaw</ENAMEX> had written that â€œhigh civilization
is not compatible with the romance of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pioneer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€</ENAMEX>)  After other introductory
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pleasantries Shaw</ENAMEX> confessed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œI</ENAMEX> had an axe of
my own to grind; and I thought that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s
book might help me to grind it.â€  And grind it he did,
vigorously and garrulously.  The rest of the preface is a
harangue on alphabet reform and has little to do with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s theories.  (At times I have wondered how
much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilson</ENAMEX> he had read.)

            The new edition was widely reviewed.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Literary Supplement</ENAMEX> said bluntly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œMr</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaw</ENAMEX>'s preface
ought not to blind the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> to the excellence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Professor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s treatise.â€  And a reviewer in The Fortnightly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review</ENAMEX> said this of the preface: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œIt sounds
clear, like all that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaw</ENAMEX> writes, yet it is less limpid
than the flow of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s exposition.â€

            After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaw</ENAMEX>'s death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX> we were treated to the
farce that resulted from the provision in his will that
the income from the residue of his estate be used for
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty-one</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> on the design and dissemination of a
new alphabet for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language.  That part of
the will was declared invalid by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX>, and the interested
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, not wishing an extensive romp in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, agreed to a compromise whereby the sum of
Â<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">¥8,300</NUMEX> was set aside for the development of the new
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alphabet Shaw</ENAMEX> called for and for the publication in it
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Androcles</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lion</ENAMEX> .  (Not utterly irrelevant here
are these words on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaw</ENAMEX>'s Everybody's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Political</ENAMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaw</ENAMEX> called for a new alphabet for the so-called
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Received Pronunciation</ENAMEX>--the mode of speech we call
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œOxfordâ€</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œB.<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">B.C. English</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX>  (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At one</NUMEX> time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaw</ENAMEX> was

responsible for spoken-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> standards.)  That would
have put most of the English-speaking world out in the
phonetic cold, and would muck up written <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speakers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General American</ENAMEX> would have made no
effort to go along with it.  We every- r -sounding
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canadians</ENAMEX> would have been permanently confined to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">linguistic bush</ENAMEX>.  No r -rolling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scot</ENAMEX>, after generations
of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œGeorrgeâ€</ENAMEX> would condescend to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œGawge.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€  Shaw</ENAMEX>
would not have liked the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>
spoke--ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>
kind, with every r sounded.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> was sensitive
to the growing edges of language, and he rejoiced in
the ambiguities of it because they are signs of life and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaw</ENAMEX>, on the hand, had a strangely
static understanding of language: he was downright
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parochial</ENAMEX> and more than a little snobbish about spoken
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and how an alphabet should standardize it.

            In the new edition of the book <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> put this
little note following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaw</ENAMEX> preface: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œI am gratefully

which this present cheap edition would not have
been published.â€  As I read that I can hear the gentle
irony in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s voice and I can see the twinkle in his
eyes--and I can imagine his rubbing his hands a little
over that final bit.

            Then I ask myself this question: Who used whom
to grind whose axe anyway?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s book, after sales of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100,000</NUMEX> in
its various editions, went out of print in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>, the year
of his death.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Journal of Linguistics</ENAMEX>
celebrated its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> anniversary with a substantial
issue consisting of the whole of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s original edition
of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Birth of Language</ENAMEX> , with a valuable introduction
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.K. Chambers</ENAMEX>--and without the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaw</ENAMEX> preface.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers</ENAMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Linguistic</ENAMEX>

comment: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œVirtually unaware of the developing science

view than was then current, giving central importance
to mentalism and language universals.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€  Wilson</ENAMEX> may
yet come to be recognized as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pioneer</ENAMEX> in what perhaps
can be called <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œphilosophical linguistics</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€  His</ENAMEX> book
is again in print.
         
         

            In his treatise on words and expressions derived
from firearms [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XV,1</NUMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Lederer</ENAMEX> was often correct
in his selection of words but was often wrong as to
their meanings and derivations.  His knowledge of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terminology</ENAMEX> is probably not first-hand.

            In the discussion of flash in the pan , the terms
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rifle</ENAMEX> and musket are used as if they were synonyms.  A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rifle</ENAMEX> is a `long-barreled firearm with spiral grooves [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rifling</ENAMEX>]
cut into the bore to impart a spin to the projectile.'
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Musket</ENAMEX> refers to a military <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX>.  Although
there were rifled muskets in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, most
were of large caliber (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.58</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.69</NUMEX>) and were smoothbore.
They were intended to be fired quickly; they
were not intended to be very accurate.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifle</ENAMEX> was
more accurate but took longer to load and was more
costly to make.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lederer</ENAMEX> writes, â€œthe flash of the primer in the pan
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifle</ENAMEX> failed to ignite the explosion of the charge.â€
The pan is the part of the gunlock that contains a
small quantity of fine gunpowder ignited by sparks
produced by the flint shearing small bits of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX> from
the frizzen .  A small hole bored in the barrel allows the
charge to be ignited.  It is the charge that is ignited,
not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œexplosionâ€</ENAMEX>; also, black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">powder</ENAMEX> does not explode:
it burns.

            The derivation and meaning of go off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> cocked
is far off the mark.  The hammer, or cock , of the gunlock
usually can be in one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX>: down
(fully forward and down); at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> cock (partly back, to
allow a flintlock to be carried with the pan closed or
the percussion cap to be placed on the nipple of a
percussion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>); or at full cock .  In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> cock position,
the trigger is not â€œpartially back-locked,â€ whatever
that means.  To over-simplify the process, when
the lock is moved to full cock, the trigger, a simple
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lever</ENAMEX>, moves another lever, the sear , out of the notch in
a semi-circular internal lock part to which the hammer
is connected.  If the gun goes off from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-cock
position, the lock is defective.  Lederer understood
the expression go off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> cocked to mean `futile gesture'
because the flintlock is unlikely to spark.  The
expression, however, derives from the percussion lock.
If the main <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> of the lock is sufficiently strong, the
blow received by the percussion cap can set it off and
the firearm discharges unexpectedly.  Going off at half
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cock</ENAMEX> is dangerous, not futile.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skinflint</ENAMEX> is not an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> expression describing
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parsimonious â€œgun toterâ</ENAMEX>€ saving money by â€œskinningâ€
his flint with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">knife</ENAMEX> to avoid buying a new
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.  Flints are knapped (and not with a knife) to
sharpen them.  I have never heard the term skinning
used for the process.  References can be found for the
term long before there was an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> frontier, and
it sounds as if someone made up this one.

            Although hanging fire is defined as being the opposite
of point-blank , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are unrelated in the field
of firearms: a hang-fire is a `delay in the ignition of the
powder charge in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firearm</ENAMEX>'--not a benign delay but a
serious, potentially deadly situation.

            
               Heavens to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy</ENAMEX>! had better remain â€œsource unknown.â€
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown Bess</ENAMEX> muskets were of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> issue,
though many were used by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> during the
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolutionary War</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> produced their own
muskets, as well, but they were not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frontier</ENAMEX>.  That was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifle</ENAMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lighter</ENAMEX>, smaller-bored, more accurate weapon than
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown Bess</ENAMEX>.

            Hell will be cold enough to freeze the balls off a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">brass monkey</ENAMEX> before the difference in the coefficients
of expansion (or contraction) of brass and iron causes
cannonballs â€œin a muzzle-loading battery on a battleshipâ€
to topple.  The reference to battleship is an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anachronism</ENAMEX>.  As for the square brass <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">circular depressions</ENAMEX> for stacking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cannonballs</ENAMEX>, it would
have to contract a great deal more than the iron balls
to cause them to tumble.  The coefficient of expansion
relates the change in volume, area, or length to a
change in temperature of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> degree <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celsius</ENAMEX>.  The cubical
coefficient for cast iron is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 0.000012</NUMEX>; for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brass</ENAMEX>, it is on the order of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.000018</NUMEX>.  If we take a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three-inch</NUMEX>
cannonball on a very hot day, compute its diameter
on a very cold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> (assuming a drop of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60Â°</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX>),
and compare this to the contraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brass</ENAMEX> for the
same drop in temperature, while it is true that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cannonballs</ENAMEX> will have shrunken twice as much as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">brass monkey</ENAMEX> , the difference for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> balls would be less
than a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">sixteenth of an inch</NUMEX>; the pile would not topple
even if their diameters were twice as large.  However,
as cannonballs would career over the deck because of
the motion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>, they were kept in crates or on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">racks</ENAMEX>, and the nice-looking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> were probably
just for show, as at monuments.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Son</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> probably is not nautical, and â€œthe
midship <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gunâ€</ENAMEX> used in the explanation doesn't make
sense.  Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were not usually found on naval
vessels except in harbor.  The image conveyed by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitutes</ENAMEX> being carried as supercargo
aboard fighting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> is false.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farmer & Henley</ENAMEX>, Slang
and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analogues</ENAMEX> , defines the term as â€œa <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX>'s bastard,â€
although the nautical connotation occurs in a
reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sailor's Wordbook</ENAMEX> , which refers to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who sailed with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX>, not to loose
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F&H</ENAMEX> also defines gun as a `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thief</ENAMEX>.'  This meaning
of gun brings the phrase parallel with â€œson of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bitchâ€</ENAMEX> (bitch=<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whore</ENAMEX>), a derivation that seems more
likely.

            In the discussion of stick to one's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lederer</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that â€œmany a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX> was actually chained to his
gun to ensure bravery.â€  I would like to know where
that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> came from.  Artillerymen were, and are, very
proud of their role in warfare.  A gun <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> was a
skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of, usually, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who spent a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX> deal of time practising loading, aiming, and firing
their piece.  Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> had a specific duty that had
to be carried out efficiently, not only for effectiveness,
but also for safety.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> chained to the gun (to ensure
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bravery</ENAMEX>?)  would be of little use, especially after
the recoil that followed firing.

            The explanation for spike one's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> is barely adequate.
The spike was a metal rod driven through the
touch-hole (also called the vent) into the bore of the
gun.  The spike was bent, either by driving it against
the lower side of the bore or by pounding the part
inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cannon</ENAMEX> with the rammer, so that the rod
could not be removed easily.

            I think Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lederer</ENAMEX> should have muzzled himself
and committed battery upon those who gave him his
information.  Neither muzzle not battery is used with a
connotation related to armaments.  However, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Heritage Dictionary</ENAMEX> includes in the derivation
of muzzle the â€œGallo-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> musellum (unattested).â€
So, too, with â€œGunning for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX>.â€
Much of it should be qualified with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œunattested</ENAMEX>,â€ a term etymologically related to the brass
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX>'s spheroidal appendages.



         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lysander Kemp</ENAMEX>'s â€œMrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malaprop</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexicoâ</ENAMEX>€
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>] recalled my own struggles with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>.  I
remember fondly one I repeated frequently one summer
as I hitchhiked up the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> coast.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œHow</ENAMEX> did
you get here,â€ I was often asked.  â€œPor baleia,â€ I responded,
mistaking boleia the `lift one gives a hitchhiker,'
for baleia a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">`whale</ENAMEX>.'  I expect the image of being
successively vomited up along the coast by a great fish
amused the seafaring <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX>.

            The most embarrassing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> malapropism I
committed took place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>, where terms innocuous
in continental <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> have transmuted into
dangerous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">slang</ENAMEX>.  Newly arrived, I taxied to my office
and found what seemed to be a queue by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">elevators</ENAMEX>.
To be certain it was indeed an elevator queue I asked
the gentleman in front of me â<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">€œse o senhor</ENAMEX> estava na
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bicha</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€  Bicha</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> means a `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queue</ENAMEX>'; in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>, it
is very crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">slang</ENAMEX> for a `homosexual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.'  I had asked
the gentleman, roughly, â€œAre you into homosexuality?â€
He looked away.  The error was a bottomless source of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">merriment</ENAMEX> to my <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>.



         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Backwords</ENAMEX> and Newances



            Having lost my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Timex</ENAMEX> down a
hotel drain, I found myself shopping for a
watch <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months ago</TIMEX>.  The problem was that so
many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> I looked at had digital readouts
without any soul.  I wanted the timepiece I was used
to, a normal watch, as I told the saleswoman, you
know, with hands and--

            â€œYou mean an analog watch,â€ she said crisply, and
led me to a nearby display.  There I found a watch with
hands that suited me, made my purchase, and left,
but a question was still ticking within: analog watch ?
Presumably, the analog refers to measuring time by an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analog</ENAMEX>, with hands and a circular face, rather than by
the more scientific-looking digital system.  There is
precedent, after all, in analog computers, which compute
by some analog such as discrete electrical voltages
for numerical values.  Or maybe analog computer used
to be simply computer --we live in an age of technological
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexity</ENAMEX>, I concluded, as I bicycled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> that
day from work.

            The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX>, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX> asked for an acoustic
guitar for his birthday.  I won't bother going into the
conversation that ensued; suffice it to say that acoustic
guitars are simply the non-electric type and derive
their sound from the acoustics of the instrument itself.
In the same way, manual typewriters depend on the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of the fingers to create words, rather than on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electric</ENAMEX> (or electronic) assistance.  But where do these
terms come from?  The point is that these qualifiers
were added only in retrospect, when the emergence of
a new prototype made some distinction necessary.
They aren't quite neologisms to account for new technology,
like cryogenics or LED .  Rather, they come
from new technology looking back on old technology--and
I've decided to call them backwords.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Backwords</ENAMEX> differ from back formations : the latter are
words (often verbs) formed on existing words (often
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nouns</ENAMEX>) by severing an ending.  For example, diagnosis
was borrowed from a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> word (which, incidentally,
did not mean the same thing); <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> afterwards, the verb diagnose --a back formation --was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coined</ENAMEX>.

            Apart from documenting linguistic treachery,
however, the collecting of backwords provides capsule
views of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s progress in a variety of fields.  Mono
sound equipment brings back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> when the phonograph
rested in the den instead of in the home entertainment
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>, when quadraphonic might have been
a malapropism for something in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Phantom of the</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Opera</ENAMEX> .  Other backwords involve longer journeys in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>: straight razors were the only razors around until
the emergence of safety razors, which have in turn
ceded precedence to the injector-blade and finally the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twin-blade</ENAMEX>.  The term live performance gained currency
some time after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edison</ENAMEX>'s inventions.  Similarly,
the phrase recorded live , while it suggests the overtones
of a concert rather than a studio performance,
may still sound odd to an untrained ear (this may be
termed sound mixing, in a double sense).  The phrase
live <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> , if dwelt upon overmuch, suggests a
ghoulish alternative.  Fountain pen, dirt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, manual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX>, steam engine, hand-woven fabric, conventional
weapons, general practitioner, natural childbirth,
cloth diaper --these are backwords dating anywhere
from the era of the jalopy to the nuclear age.
They can, I suppose, be summed up in that slightly
suspect word progress .  Still, I must in all fairness note
that I write with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bic</ENAMEX> and drive an automatic-shift
with perfect equanimity.  The frame of mind for hunting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">backwords</ENAMEX> need not be disgruntlement.

            In the gustatory realm, backwords are common:
Fresh-squeezed orange juice and hand-dipped ice
cream simply make the point that most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX> and ice
cream no longer come that way.  Ditto for free-range
chicken and draft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> .  And then there are what
sound like redundancies: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">champagne</ENAMEX> is a hotly
contested instance.  The notice that a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> other than
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> could produce an effervescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> and then
have the audacity to label it champagne was the basis
for a lawsuit rather than an etymological inquiry.  On a
more prosaic level, the terms plain yogurt, potato
knish, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese blintz</ENAMEX> would have been considered
tautological <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years ago</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nowadays</ENAMEX>, when blintzes
may be filled with anything from purÃ©ed walnuts to
spinach, and yogurt comes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighteen</NUMEX> different varieties,
plain has acquired its own distinction.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> tried to capitalize on this distinction
after the financial disaster of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Coke</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> nostalgic
for the old <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">product</ENAMEX> could purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Classic Coke</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarkets</ENAMEX>.  â€œGreat original flavor!â€  is the boast of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> trying to distance a
product from its own later derivatives.

            It is a puzzle why certain objects acquire backwords
while others retain their names and it is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newcomers</ENAMEX> that are given qualifying labels.  These
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, video cameras are all the rage, but, as far as I
know, no one has thought up a backword for the snapshot-taking
type ( still camera does fill the bill, but it
remains for the most part a technical term).  When
automated tellers came in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years ago</TIMEX>, no one
thought to rename the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX>.  Much further
back, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobiles</ENAMEX> were first known as horseless carriages;
no one called the carriages they replaced
animal-driven <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> (though someone might call
them that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>).  The governing principle
seems to be inurement: when the new has sufficiently
taken hold, it becomes a standard.  At the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, the old acquires the status of a curiosity, deserving
of its own label.

            Perhaps the best example of this paradigm is the
touch-tone phone, which has so edged out the older
models that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backwords</ENAMEX> were formed for the old
type: rotary phone and dial phone .
On the other hand, cellular phones are still new enough to have
their own novelty label.  They are really radio phones,
as opposed to a short-range instrument called a cordless
phone that is at present a miracle of convenience
and voice-distortion.  Given time and improved technology,
all non-radio phones may be branded as wire
phones .

            Often, the new meaning may be imposed on the
old word without any change in the word itself.  To
distinguish them from backwords, they may be termed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">newances</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dishwasher</ENAMEX> (appliance, not restaurant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supernumerary</ENAMEX>), tape (magnetic, not sticky), and car
(automotive, not horse-drawn) are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> ready instances
of this shift, but there are countless others.  In
the field of computing alone are such newances as
program, chip, terminal, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">printer</ENAMEX>, and so on; software
is listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merriam-Webster Second Edition</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1934</TIMEX>)
as soft wares and defined as â€œdry goods.â€  In the realm
of newances are also a series of verbs: call , from shouting
to telephoning; see , from in the flesh to virtual
image; fly , from avian to human; and drive , applied
slightly differently to each new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> developed.  And
while xerography has provided both noun and verb
newances for the word copy , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horace</ENAMEX>'s ut pictura poesis
reminds one that picture , too, has newances coexisting
with its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age-old</TIMEX> meanings.

            Finally, there are the objects that, while still possessing
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> basic nomenclature, show marked potential
for confusion and hence for backwords.  A bicycle
is no longer just a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX>; it may now be a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-speed
bike, a mountain bike (now tagged as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATB</ENAMEX> , or `allterrain
bike'), or a stationary bike (also known as an
exercise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> ).  The backword in the offing, already
used by many, is road <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> , though it usually means a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-speed, which is now used as a noun.  As for other
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> with potential, have color televisions become
standard enough to qualify all black-and-white <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>?
Will the flood of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decaff</ENAMEX> poured <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> eventually
lead to a diner in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> requesting a cup of caff?
When will keyboard and word process do something
to typewriter and type (if they haven't already).  Will
the microwave revolution in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> turn conventional
cooking devices into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œmacrowaveâ€ ovens</ENAMEX>?  Any
proficient lexicographer should be an acute <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modernity</ENAMEX> in all its aspects.

            As with other etymological quests, the search for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">backwords</ENAMEX> and newances may become a consuming
hobby.  All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> needs is a sense of history that exceeds
one's lifetime.  Wood-burning stove and handwritten
note are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> recent items for the backwords collection.
Carriageway , as it is used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, is a good instance
of a newance.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Just yesterday</TIMEX>, I passed a furniture store
advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œcustom-madeâ€ cabinets.</ENAMEX>  It occurred to me
that custom-made anything is approaching the realm
of the anomalous: another item for the collection.  The
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> risk in collecting backwords is that it does tend to
make one feel like an antiquity, possibly deserving of a
backword oneself.  Right now, I can't think of such a
label.  Given time, however, history may provide me
with one.
            The technical term, often so labeled on the base of the phone, is
pulse-tone , as opposed to touch-tone , a distinction in signal transmission;
nowadays certain telephones with buttons are really pulse-tone
models that â€œdialâ€ as each button is pushed.
         
         

            My ears (or should I say my eyes) pricked up upon

            Writing the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hard Way</ENAMEX>



            
               
It is a truly gripping story, told in lean, hard
athletic narrative prose.

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> Times book review of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sun Also Rises</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</TIMEX>.
            

            What does it mean to call a prose style hard?
What does hard add to lean in describing
sentences like these:


We dined at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bois</ENAMEX>.  It was a
good dinner.  Food had an excellent place in the
count's values.  So did <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>.  The count was in fine
form during the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX>.  So was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brett</ENAMEX>.  It was a good
party.
            

            The harder something is the less it is influenced by
other things, the less it interacts.  In the above paragraph,
the first-person <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Barnes</ENAMEX>, gives
the fact of a dinner, the experience of a dinner, and the
value of a dinner their own self-contained moments.
There is no syntactical relationship linking them.
Longer sentences are mostly the same: a series of short
sentences cut off not with a period, but with and :


I wondered if there was anything else I might
pray for, and I thought I would like to have some
money, so I prayed that I would make a lot of
money, and then I started to think how I would
make it, and thinking of money reminded me of
the count, and I started wondering about where he
was, and regretting I hadn't seen him since that
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montmartre</ENAMEX>, and about something funny
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brett</ENAMEX> told me about him...
            

            Even long sentences other than a series of short sentences
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strung</ENAMEX> together set forth <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> discrete moment
at a time:


Out in the center of the ring, all alone, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romero</ENAMEX>
was going on with the same thing, getting so close
that the bull could see him plainly, offering the
body, offering it again a little closer, the bull
watching dully, then so close that the bull thought
he had him, offering again and finally drawing the
charge and then, just before the horns came, giving
the bull the red cloth to follow with that little, almost
perceptible, jerk that so offended the critical
judgment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biarritz</ENAMEX> bull-fight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>.
            

            The various moments here are related only sequentially.
Despite the intense interaction that exists
between a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bullfighter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bull</ENAMEX>, there is an avoidance
of interactive conjunctions such as when, while,
and as .

            It is this very avoidance of interactive conjunctions
throughout the novel that creates the hard style.  Such
conjunctions, when placed in the beginning or middle
of a sentence, form clauses that hang suspended,
awaiting definition from their relationship with what
follows.  Sentences which use such clauses are softer,
more pliant.  Not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boxer</ENAMEX>'s jab--coming at you from
close range, with its full effect felt at once--but a
dismount from a high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virginia Woolf</ENAMEX>, for one,
often used suspension to create a world of subtle interaction:


There were <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">few mornings</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> did not
look up, as she bent to lace her boots, and as she
followed the yellow rod from curtain to breakfasttable
she usually breathed some sigh of thankfulness
that her life provided her with such moments
of pure enjoyment.

--<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Night and Day</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harcourt Brace Jovanovich</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX>.
            

            There is a moment of pure enjoyment depicted by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> Also Rises which uses this
same interactive syntax.  Riding on top of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> countryside, squeezed in among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> whose
language (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basque</ENAMEX>) he doesn't speak, he turns his attention
to the land around him.  It is much like terrain he
has described before, only now, for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, he
does not break down the description into a mere series
of self-contained, tightly held moments.  As much as
the words themselves, the syntax shows him to be relaxing
into the moment:


As soon as we started out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> outside
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> it was cool.  It felt nice riding high up and
close under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> went quite fast and
made a good breeze, and as we went out along the
road with the dust powdering the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and down
the hill, we had a fine view, back through the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> rising up from the bluff above
the river.
            

            But for the most part, interaction between clauses is
reserved for moments of consternation.  The narrator
does not let down his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX>, he must be thrown off it:


Why I felt that impulse to devil him I do not
know.

When I got up to go I found I had taken off my
shoes.

While we were waiting I saw a cockroach on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parquet</ENAMEX> floor that must have been at least three
inches long.

As all the time I was kneeling with my forehead on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> in front of me, and was thinking of myself
as praying, I was a little ashamed...

He offered the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>-skin to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> and to me, and
when I tipped it up to drink he imitated the sound
of a klaxon motor-horn so well and so suddenly
that I spilled some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, and everybody
laughed.

As I started to get on my feet he hit me twice.

She kissed me, and while she kissed me I could feel
she was thinking of something else.

When I woke it was the sound of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rocket</ENAMEX> exploding
that announced the release of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bulls</ENAMEX> from
the corrals at the edge of town.

            

            So select is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> in his use of such suspensions
that the simple variation of the placement of a
clause in two otherwise almost identical statements can
be momentous.  Look at the two phrases: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œWe</ENAMEX> met
Cohn as we came out of churchâ€ and â€œAs we came out
of the door I saw <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohn</ENAMEX>.â€  Both times the narrator is
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who had had a brief affair with his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend Cohn</ENAMEX> and then dumped him.  But the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> is not sure how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> feels about his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend</ENAMEX> hanging around, whereas the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time he
has just been told by her that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cohn</ENAMEX>'s presence
â€œdepresses me so.â€  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, then, he can plainly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">state â€œWe</ENAMEX> met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohn</ENAMEX>...,â€ but the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time the
encounter is troublesome: he is caught in the middle
between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>.  The mere suspension of the
meaning of the sentence expresses the quandary.  The
encounter itself is not expanded or even commented
on.

            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyndham Lewis</ENAMEX>, the voice of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnes</ENAMEX> contradicts his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> because it makes
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of action sound passive:


This infantile, dull-witted, dreamy stutter compels
whoever uses it to conform to the infantile,
dull-witted type.  He passes over into the category
of those to whom things are done, from that of
those who execute.


--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> Without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Sparrow Press</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>.
            

            But the hard style of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX>, far from being
an expression of passivity, is, in fact, a symptom of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who is trying to avoid having things done to
him--someone afraid to let go of himself, afraid to
merge.  The castrating war wound from which he suffers,
barely mentioned in the novel, is merely the outward
show of this inner disability, to which we are
referred again and again.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> tells us that he
has trouble falling asleep: he cannot give himself up to
darkness.  For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one six-month period</TIMEX> he never slept with
the light off.  â€œIt is awfully easy,â€ he says â€œto be hardboiled
about everything in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime</TIMEX>, but at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> it
is a different thing.â€

            Nor can he fall in love: he cannot give himself up
to another.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œShe</ENAMEX> had been looking into my eyes all the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.  Her eyes had different depths, sometimes they
seemed perfectly flat.  Now you could see all the way
into them.â€  You do not need to ask what depth level his
eyes were at as he was observing her.  Throughout the
novel he convinces us that he is drawn to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> but
not to love itself: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œIn a way,â€ he says of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">it, â€œit</ENAMEX>'s an
enjoyable feeling.â€  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, however, knows better:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œNo</ENAMEX>,â€ she says, â€œI think it's hell on earth.â€  And the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> can't dispute this, because what the woman
feels when she is in love would be, for a hardboiled
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, a living hell: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œLove you?â€  she replies to his entreaty,
â€œI simply turn all to jelly when you touch me.â€

            Giving himself over to hatred is no easier.  After
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> runs off with this same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> his strongest
statement is â€œI certainly did hate him.<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€</ENAMEX>  Had he said â€œI
hated him,â€ he would have been giving himself over to
that emotion, throwing himself off balance; but the
work certainly acts like a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cane</ENAMEX> to prevent it.  (Try saying,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œI</ENAMEX> certainly do love youâ€ without eyes that are
perfectly flat.)  He cannot even give himself over to
jealousy.  To be jealous of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is to be open to
another's influence, to have one's sense of self continuously
challenged by another.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> is not jealous
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> he â€œcertainly did hate,â€ but only
â€œjealous of what happened to him.â€  By dismissing the
perpetrator he confronts only the act.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œStyle</ENAMEX>,â€ according to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georges Louis</ENAMEX>, â€œis the man
himself,â€ and part of what makes The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Also Rises</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX>'s masterpiece is how much of himself he
managed to get into it.  He was never again to write as
autobiographical a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Barnes</ENAMEX>, never
again to use a voice as tightly controlled.  Yet the character,
it seems, never left him.  Even in his final moment,
the hard style was there.

            To take one's own life is to take control of one's
destiny; but inevitably a moment must be faced, after
the deed, in which what is experienced is loss of control.
The longer the time between the deed and the
moment of death, the more that loss--the giving up of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oneself</ENAMEX>--is experienced.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX> did not just shoot
himself.  He leaned his forehead on the barrel of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rifle</ENAMEX> and only then pulled the trigger.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virginia Woolf</ENAMEX>,
on the other hand, loaded her dress up with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> and
let the river carry her away.

            I have a few entries to propose for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Lederer</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Concise Dictionary of American Slurvian:</ENAMEX>

            In his article, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œAmerican Slurvianâ€</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lederer</ENAMEX> issued a delicious challenge; however,
some of the terms he claims are examples of Slurvian
are highly suspect.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œFormallyâ€ and â€œthenâ€</ENAMEX> applied
where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œformerlyâ€</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œthanâ€</ENAMEX> are intended are merely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misuses</ENAMEX>.  No lazy mouth here--if asked to put it into
writing, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> would probably write the wrong
words in the same context.

            The citations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite (â€œtaking</ENAMEX> it for graniteâ€)
and intensive (â€œfor all intensive purposesâ€) are embedded
in clichÃ©s.  I maintain that those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> choices are
merely misunderstood expressions, derived from trying
to make sense out of auditory confusion rather than
being the result of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">slouchy verbal vapors</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>
probably thinks â€œtaking it for graniteâ€ is correct, justifying
it as meaning â€œas solid and stable as a slab of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX>.â€  Similar faulty justification could be made for
â€œintensive purposes.â€  In fact, such expressions may be
perpetuated by others who hear the wrong version of
the clichÃ©, take it for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX>, and, for all intensive
purposes, use it as the genuine expression.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayan</ENAMEX> (as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">â€œWhat</ENAMEX>'s yours is yours, and what's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayan</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayanâ€</ENAMEX>) is another of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lederer</ENAMEX>'s more
dubious examples.  He maintains <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> is a rare form
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slurvian</ENAMEX> created by adding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an extra</NUMEX> syllable.  I
maintain it is not Slurvian at all.  It is regional dialect.
How do we judge all as in â€œI need to get some all for
my carâ€?  All is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dialect</ENAMEX>; is it also Slurvian?  I
would <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> that it isn't, no more so than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Earl</ENAMEX> , as in â€œI
need to get some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Earl</ENAMEX> for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>,â€ as stated in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ninth Ward</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX>.  I have heard milk pronounced
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œmeowkâ€</ENAMEX> by one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, but
I would hesitate to label â€œmeowkâ€ as an example of
double-syllable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slurvian</ENAMEX>.  That pronunciation can
probably be traced to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">familial</ENAMEX>/regional roots, not to
lazy mouth disease.  In fact, I should doubt that a lazy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mouth</ENAMEX> would bother to add <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an extra</NUMEX> syllable.
Wouldn't the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slurvian</ENAMEX> tongue take the most slothful
route, avoiding waggle where waggle is avoidable?

            Before we Slurvophobian sleuths begin our hunt,
some rules of the game need to be defined.  I suggest
that each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slurvian</ENAMEX> term should have one or more of the
following characteristics to distinguish it from some
other form of (mis) pronunciation:

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Consonants</ENAMEX> and/or vowels are left out.  Examples
taken from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lederer</ENAMEX>'s list are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œliningâ€</ENAMEX> for lightning ,
â€œlaysâ€ for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œforcedâ€</ENAMEX> for forest , â€œpleaseâ€
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œtormentâ€</ENAMEX> for tournament .

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.  Vowels are squashed.  Whereas â€œMayanâ€ is dialect,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œmahn</ENAMEX>,â€ bearing a squashed i , could certainly be
considered an impure Slurvian form of the word.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œWhirâ€</ENAMEX> is pure <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Slurvian</ENAMEX> for where .

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.  Combinations of sounds that ordinarily require
movement from both lips and tongue are compromised
so that all the work is done by only the lips or
only the tongue.  Consider the case of the three
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sams</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Witch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sam Ridge</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Itch</ENAMEX>.  Any
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> you slice it, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Earl</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sandwich</ENAMEX> was responsible,
but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> examples fit the Slurvian
rule of swallow and squash.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Witch</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Itch</ENAMEX> are pure <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Slurvian</ENAMEX>.  The lips took away the
duty of the tongue by substituting an m for an n .
But what about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sam Ridge</ENAMEX>?  The tongue hoisted
itself up and bothered to put in an unnecessary r .
Wouldn't <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sam Ridge</ENAMEX>, then, be just plain mispronunciation?
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sand Ridge</ENAMEX>, on the other hand ...

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.  Combinations of sounds requiring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or more</NUMEX> consecutive
tongue movements are distorted into one
compromised sound.  What are you doing becomes
â€œWatch a dune.â€  How much easier for the tongue to
splat itself against the palate and make a ch sound
rather than make <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> more delicate maneuvers to
form the sounds of a t , and an r , and a y .

            Removed from clichÃ©, could there be pure Slurvian
words that have become exalted by repetition--perhaps
an elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slurvian</ENAMEX> of the upper
plane?  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œBob wireâ€</ENAMEX> (for barbed wire ) may qualify as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">elevated Slurvian</ENAMEX>.  At first I was prepared to offer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œsparrow grassâ€</ENAMEX> (for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asparagus</ENAMEX> ) as elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Slurvian</ENAMEX>; I
now retract the offer.  Is it Slurvian or is it wondrous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mispronunciation</ENAMEX>?  It doesn't fit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slurvian</ENAMEX>, rule of
consonant deletion.  The tongue has added an r after
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> ; would a lazy tongue go to that much trouble?
Like â<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">€œsparrow grass</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€ â€œcalvaryâ€</ENAMEX> for cavalry , one of Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lederer</ENAMEX>'s questionable examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slurvian</ENAMEX>, falls midway
between pure mispronunciation and misunderstood
expression, perpetuated by a massive misuse.  A
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Slurv</ENAMEX> who knew the difference would say â€œcavry.â€

            Perhaps we Slurvophobes should be alert to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
types of pure <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Slurvian</ENAMEX>; regular, elevated, and complete
sentence.  I offer the following examples of completesentence
Slurvian:

I moan ohm; I mow Nome: I'm going home.)

Watch a dune: (What are you doing?)

Watch a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seine</ENAMEX>: (What are you saying?)

Whirred ego; Word ego: (Where did he go?)

            

            Below are more examples of regular pure <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Slurvian</ENAMEX>,
to add to the collection:


A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">myrrh</ENAMEX> can `from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>': <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œI can tell
she's A myrrh can ...â€.

            I thought that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> may find interesting
this example of how tradition can be made.  Had I
taken your advice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months ago</TIMEX> and referred to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brewer</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Phrase & Fable</ENAMEX> , my research would have
been easier.  But by reviewing items I had gathered and
after examining annotated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bibles</ENAMEX>, especially the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dart</ENAMEX>-mouth
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bible</ENAMEX>, I arrived at the same derivation as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brewer's</ENAMEX>.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Years ago</TIMEX>, while sightseeing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, I went to
the church <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pietro e Vinculo</ENAMEX> to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo</ENAMEX>'s
sculpture of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX>.  Although I had seen pictures of the
sculpture, I was startled to notice for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time
animal or devil horns visible beneath the curly hair of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX>.  And I became melancholy as I puzzled over
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo</ENAMEX>'s reasons for what I supposed was an
insult to the deliverer of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hebrews and the Law</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giver</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western World</ENAMEX>.  I groaned at the thought
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">succumbing to sixteenth-century</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anti-Semitism</ENAMEX>.  Even though I work in publishing, it
did not occur to me that a mistranslation or a typographical
error could make its way into the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Authors</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> employ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> and proofreaders
to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> publications free of error.  In spite of all
efforts, errors get by, at least in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> printings.  I should
have realized that early translations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aramaic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>, then into
all the languages of the world, would be at least as
vulnerable as modern-day <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX>.

            In cycles of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bavarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of
Oberammergau, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biblical</ENAMEX> passion play attracts <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.  The next show is in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, I believe.  In
the pageant, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX> is costumed to display horns.  Pleas
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> asking for the elimination of
the horns have not been heeded.  It took a while, but I
think I learned the source of those horns, which I now
see in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> paintings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX>, varying
from cute little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">devil</ENAMEX>'s horns to those that look like
horns of an antler.

            Exodus <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">34:29</TIMEX>, describes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX> descending from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount Sinai</ENAMEX> after talking to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jahveh</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yahweh</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jehovah</ENAMEX>).
Understandably, after talking to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almighty</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> cannot expect to be the same again.  So, when
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX> came down from the mountain, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œthe</ENAMEX> skin of his
face shoneâ€ (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Version</ENAMEX>).  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Jerome</ENAMEX>, translating
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> and referring to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, while
preparing the (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vulgate</ENAMEX>, evidently mistranslated
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hebrew</ENAMEX> qaran to shine, for qeren horn and went
on record with cornuta , horned: Quod cornuta esset
facies sua .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brewer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Phrase & Fable</ENAMEX> calls
the translation â€œa blunder,â€ explaining that â<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">€œthe Hebrew</ENAMEX>
for this shining may be translated either as `sent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">forth</ENAMEX> beams' or as `sent forth horns.' â€  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vulgate</ENAMEX> took
the latter, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo</ENAMEX> followed earlier painters
in depicting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX> with horns.

            Adding further to the wonder of it all is this translation
(in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brewer</ENAMEX> ) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vulgate</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œHis [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX>]
brightness was as the light; he had horns [rays of light]
coming out of his hand [not his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>!].  That was
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1400 years ago</TIMEX>.  Now the horns are traditional.



         
         

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1977</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> published a letter I
wrote containing some mock sociological â€œlawsâ€ I had
collected of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Murphy's</ENAMEX> Law type.  That resulted in a
literary adventure worth reporting, for since then the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> has taken on a remarkable life of its own.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1978</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James J. Kilpatrick</ENAMEX> wrote a column
in which he republished much of the letter and
described the observations as â€œprofound laws ...
among the truths we live by.â€  The column was syndicated
nationally, with both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> and me mentioned
prominently.  I became a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nationally Quoted Authority</ENAMEX>
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">The Field</ENAMEX>.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few months later</TIMEX>, the article
was reprinted as the back-page humor article in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> of a giant international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX>--for
money.  I was now Internationally Published
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Professional</ENAMEX>, authorially speaking.  Life was good.

            Then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Dixon</ENAMEX> published The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Official Rules</ENAMEX>,
â€œthe definitive, annotated collection of laws, principles,
and instructions for dealing with the world.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€  All</ENAMEX>
the original â€œlawsâ€ were there, and I was cited as â€œthe
authorityâ€ for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Borkowski's Law</ENAMEX>: You can't guard
against the arbitrary .  It is named after a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of
mine who said it in a drunken stupor.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chamberlain</ENAMEX>'s
Laws were also there, and so the rÃ©sumÃ© <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> included
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scholar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Original Contributor</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genre</ENAMEX>.  I became
sought after by hostesses.  But the best was yet to
come.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> I became a Sex Symbol, fulfilling a lifelong
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ambition</ENAMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chamberlain</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> Law was
published in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cosmopolitan</ENAMEX> .  The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Law</ENAMEX> is itself a bit
more prosaic: Everything tastes more or less like
chicken .  And by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chamberlain</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> Law and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Borkowski's Law</ENAMEX> had become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox</ENAMEX> art--those unattributed
photocopies of vulgarity and cheap wit that
circulate around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>.  This propelled me into the
public domain and made me, of course, a Lawgiver
and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Legend</ENAMEX>.

            I figure that with a little luck I can be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lion</ENAMEX> of
Literature in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just a few more years</TIMEX>.  Then I'll give up
my job and conduct motivational seminars.



         
         
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxonomy</ENAMEX> of Epigrams



            â€œWhat is an epigram?  A dwarfish whole: its
body brevity, and wit its soul.â€  So said
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coleridge</ENAMEX> in an epigram of his own.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nietzsche</ENAMEX> called
them â€œthoughts out of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>,â€ and Tagore his â€œstray
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>.â€  They may be little nothings, but they are also
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> of pith and vinegar, if you'll pardon the lisp.  â€œI
think, therefore I amâ€ said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Descartes</ENAMEX>, to which one
might add: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œI think, therefore I (epigr) am.â€  Epigramming
is a form of word play (or thought play) which
evolved from epitaphs on tombstones.  Because of the
material on which it was inscribed, the message had to
be brief and literally to the point.  â€œO rare <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Jonson</ENAMEX>!â€
reads the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>'s inscription on his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westminster</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbey</ENAMEX>.  What would you like to put on yours?  Endings
are a good place to start.

            As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Wescott</ENAMEX> has shown (in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> article),
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epigrams</ENAMEX> also evolved from proverbs and adages.  The
difference is that these earlier forms were inclined to
take themselves seriously, while epigrams or aphorisms
are more frequently reflexive and satirical.  Even
though some epigrams are rhymed, they are not to be
confused with poetry, or even blank verse.  Poems rely
on narrative imagery to evoke feelings, while epigrams
focus on contradictions to provoke thought.  The explosive
tension of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">epigram</ENAMEX> serves to focus consciousness,
while the opennness of poetic imagery serves to
dilate consciousness.

            In my own case, writing epigrams may be a congenital
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">defect</ENAMEX>, since it was my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s preferred style
in several of his books.  I started writing them in my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX> I launched a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> called
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thoughts For All Seasons</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magazine</ENAMEX> of Epigrams
[ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFAS</ENAMEX> ].  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thoughts</ENAMEX> came out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>, a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bicentennial year</TIMEX>.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> issue celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orwell</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>.  The current issue marks the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bicentennial</TIMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill of Rights</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">French Revolution</ENAMEX>.  It
is also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pitirim Sorokin</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centennial</TIMEX>.  Our quincentennial
issue will appear in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, and the general theme
will be the discovery and rediscovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorokin</ENAMEX> has been called the world's greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologist</ENAMEX>,
but he was also a master satirist.  We live in a
satirical age, after all, and epigrams are the perfect
vehicle for social satire.  Consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorokin</ENAMEX>'s cyclical
theory of social change, our time bears an uncanny
resemblance to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">A.D.</ENAMEX> when a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martial</ENAMEX> was penning his epigrams.
(â€œConceal a flaw, and the world will imagine the
worst.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€  â€œYou</ENAMEX> ask what a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> will do?  She won't
give <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an inch</NUMEX>, but she won't say no.â€  â€œYou'll get no
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laurel crown</ENAMEX> for outrunning a burro.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€  â€œYou</ENAMEX> puff the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">poets</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">other days</TIMEX>, the living you deplore; spare me
the accolade: your praise is not worth dying for.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€</ENAMEX>)

            Although epigrams are usually sorted into content
categories, I am going to attempt a semantic and
structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxonomy</ENAMEX>.  Although my classification system
does not apply to all the epigrams I have seen or
published, it does seem to include most of them.  As we
shall see, many epigrams fall into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> category,
but the categories themselves are conceptually
distinct.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEMANTICS</ENAMEX>

            a)  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satirical Definitions</ENAMEX>

            The most systematic example of this form may be
found in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Devil's Dictionary</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrose Bierce</ENAMEX>.
The following examples, however, are all TFAS originals:


adult a fossil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>.

anorexic a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vegetarian</ENAMEX> who doesn't eat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>.

condoms where the rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> live.

consistency a form of ritualism.

deviance something in the eye of the beholder.

fate an unconscious choice.

grantsmanship a form of panhandling in which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> are very well dressed.

marriage friendship put to the test.

nuclear family an explosive device.

obstetrics a system of religious belief based on the
assumption that pregnancy is a disease and that
natural birth must be prevented at all costs.

optimist someone who waxes his skis in preparation
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nuclear Winter</ENAMEX>.

Zen the highest form of unconsciousness.
            

            b)  Comparisons

            This type of epigram involves an association between
things which have no apparent connection.  For example:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scatology</ENAMEX> and eschatology are often hard to distinguish,
since they both deal with end products.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olympics</ENAMEX>: triumph of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirit</ENAMEX> or tyranny
of the performance principle?

Tell me what you remember of your life before
birth, and I will tell you what to expect in your
life after death.

In the primitive world there was human sacrifice.
Now we have elective surgery.

It is natural to be concerned about what television
does to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.  But does anyone care what it
does to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX>?
            

            c)  <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Counterpoint</ENAMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Epigrammatists</ENAMEX> frequently take old saws and stand
them on their heads, or give them a new twist which
changes the meaning.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrose Bierce</ENAMEX> defined an adage
as â€œboned wisdom for weak teethâ€; the challenge
to the epigrammatist is to put some teeth into it.


Blessed are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meek</ENAMEX>, for they shall be given safe
seats behind the pillars.

Of course we should love our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>.  They teach
us to be resolute, relentless, and resourceful.

[These are my <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> R's.]

Power corrupts not only those who wield it, but
also those who are subservient to it.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> who are â€œseen and not heardâ€ grow up to
be dumb.

Better to give than to receive, because you get a
tax write-off for it.

â€œA <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">penny</NUMEX> savedâ€ is an indication of inadequate
goal-setting behavior.

A prophet is not without honor, save in his own
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rotary Club</ENAMEX>.

How do you know they are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">swine</ENAMEX> until they reject
your pearls?

â€œTwo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> are better than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>,â€ especially if you
are seeking employment in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">circus</ENAMEX>.

If I have not seen far, it is because I stood on the
shoulders of midgets.

It's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.K.</ENAMEX> to search for the truth; just make
damned sure you don't find it.
            

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.  STRUCTURE

            a)  Repetition

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the characteristics of both proverbs and aphorisms
is repetition of syllabic structure.  If the onset of a
phrase is repeated, we have alliteration:

<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Home</ENAMEX> is where the hooks are.

If chivalry is here, can chauvinism be far behind?

It takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two to tango</TIMEX>, but any limp <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loner</ENAMEX> can
limbo.

As the prig is bent, so is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prude</ENAMEX> inclined.

The deprived soon became the depraved.
            

            When the nucleus of a phrase is repeated, we have
assonance:


Be fruit <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> and multiply.

The evil eye is the seeing eye which has been denied.
            

            When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coda</ENAMEX> is repeated, we have what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wescott</ENAMEX>
calls <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œreliterationâ€</ENAMEX>:

            Some say the world is evil, but I say it is oval.

            And when both assonance and reliteration occur, we
have rhyme:


â€œNeither a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borrower</ENAMEX> nor a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lender</ENAMEX> beâ€ plays holy
hell with the economy.

Perhaps it's boredom that causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">whoredom</ENAMEX>.

Instead of a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Reign of Terror</ENAMEX>, we now have a reign
of error.
            

            b)  Substitution

            Substitution of sounds, syntax, or meaning also occurs
in many epigrams.  When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words have identical
spellings but different meanings, we have a homonym:


An autoerotic is someone who fondles strange <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>.

Teenage pregnancy ends in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> labor.

To retire with a modicum of dignity, a little jack is
necessary.

Where there's a will, there's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hopeful relative</ENAMEX>.
            

            When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words sound the same but are spelled differently,
we have a homophone.  Obviously homophones
usually need to be written in order to make sense, but
let's experiment with the following anyway:


<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>: a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>, favored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.

Patience is for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.

Female socialization is a case of guise and dolls.

I was browsing through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, and I
found <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pere</ENAMEX>.

All good carnivores begin meals by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> muttering:
â€œLet us prey.â€

I regret that I have but one asterisk for my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
            

            Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">substitutions</ENAMEX> do not qualify as either homonyms
or homophones, but they are interesting nonetheless.
Either a letter, or an entire word, or phrase may be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">substituted</ENAMEX>, as follows:


May the farce be with you.

A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">barfing dog</ENAMEX> never bites.

Every cloud has a silly lining. (forthcoming)

Beware of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> bearing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX>.

Condoms are a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'s best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>. (forthcoming)

A wise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and his Moonie are soon parted.

Discretion is the better part of pallor.

Pro-Life vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pro-Choice</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fetalists</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fatalists</ENAMEX>.

I almost became a born-again <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> but I was
swept away by the tithe.

Do not ask God for anything; simply thank Her for
what She gives us.
            

            c)  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Transposition</ENAMEX> and Contraction

            Finally, the words of a well-known saying may be
transposed, or the entire phrase may be contracted to
create new meanings:


Sure, time wounds all heels, but the good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> get
their lumps as well.

He who laughs, lasts!
            

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wescott</ENAMEX>'s view, the age of miniaturization has
given epigrams a new lease on life.  Look around you:
they are everywhere.  I understand that graffiti have
been eliminated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway system</ENAMEX>,
but we find them in abundance on T-shirts, bumper
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stickers</ENAMEX>, and bathroom walls, as well as in a variety of
work settings.  They are personal statements even if
they are not original, and they are a way of talking
back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Establishment</ENAMEX>, that great generalized
other which intimidates and bores us at the same time.
Down with jargon!  Long live the lapidary art of
epigramming!  Writing, after all, is one of the best
forms of exercise, good for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and soul.  But I would
also like to think that there may be a few Martials
among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Thoughts For All Seasons</ENAMEX> ,
and that their quips will continue to delight or offend
long after they are gone.
