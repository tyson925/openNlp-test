   
      
         
            Frailty, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Thy Name Is Bevilacqua</ENAMEX>!



            Consider <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Columbus</ENAMEX> had
been island-hopping in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> since
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1492</TIMEX> and had touched foot on the New World mainland
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1498</TIMEX>.  But he had set out for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, and nothing
would convince him that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> was not where he
had landed.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amerigo Vespucci</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, also
looking for new routes to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, ran ashore in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1499</TIMEX> and realized that something was not right.
Returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1502</TIMEX>, he convinced himself
that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> and he had in fact stumbled onto
some continent--a New World he called it--
completely unknown to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX>.  He apparently
invented a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1497</TIMEX> voyage to make sure he and not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbus</ENAMEX> got the credit and started writing letters
announcing his discovery.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Columbus</ENAMEX> died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1506</TIMEX>
still adamant he had been to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>.  But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vespucci</ENAMEX>'s
letters hugely impressed others, including German
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cartographer Martin Waldseemuller</ENAMEX>, who in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1507</TIMEX>
published the first map to label a depiction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vespucci</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World America</ENAMEX> in his honor.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Historians</ENAMEX> have argued for generations about
whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vespucci</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1497</TIMEX> trip was a fib.  But they do
not seem to have spent much time arguing about
whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> should have followed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waldseemuller</ENAMEX>'s
lead in dubbing the new continent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> .
That may be simply because the name stuck and
there did not seem to be much point.  But I think it
is also because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> sounds so nice, because the
pure music of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amerigo Vespucci</ENAMEX> makes up for any
lies he might have told.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> were lulled by that
music into neglecting to notice that in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> Amerigo
is simply <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.

            Think of the power of that peculiarly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> euphony!
How much patriotism could we instill by requiring
our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolchildren</ENAMEX> to chant I pledge allegiance
to the flag of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX>?
Would <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walt Whitman</ENAMEX> have made the canon if he had
written I hear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX> singing?  And how much
worse would our trade deficit be if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX>
tried to attach the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> with a slogan like It's
the heartbeat of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX>, it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX>?
Still, we should be grateful that Waldseemuller
opted for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vespucci</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> name, for disguising the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dull Henry</ENAMEX> in the voluptuous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amerigo</ENAMEX> is nothing
compared to what <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> have done over the
centuries when giving each other surnames.

            Like other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> made do with
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> names alone until well into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</TIMEX>.  In
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venetian Republic</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 10th century</TIMEX>,
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were using fixed secondary names
to distinguish themselves, and at least some of these
names were passed from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.  But
outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> did not begin to adopt hereditary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surnames</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th and 15th centuries</TIMEX>,
a bit later than most of the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, according
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Hanks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flavia Hodges</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">addictive A Dictionary of Surnames</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford University</ENAMEX>
Press, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>).  As in other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>,
what probably sparked the spread of surnames was
the emergence of larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that began to centralize
tax collecting and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>.

            New bureaucratic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">functionaries</ENAMEX> now had to
keep track of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> they might never meet, and
they (and other name-givers, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> and
other local worthies) followed a few simple rules for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distinguishing one Giovanni</ENAMEX> from another.  They indicated
where he lived or where he came from: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giovanni</ENAMEX>
Montagna , lived on the mountain, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giovanni</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Valle</ENAMEX> lived in the valley; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Lombardo</ENAMEX>
had his roots in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lombardy</ENAMEX> while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Genovesi</ENAMEX>
had his in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Genoa</ENAMEX>.  They sorted him by his hair: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giovanni</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruno</ENAMEX> was brunette, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Biondi</ENAMEX> blonde,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Rossi</ENAMEX> red-headed, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giovanni</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rizzo</ENAMEX> had curly hair.  They pointed out his general
aspect: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Piccolo</ENAMEX> was short, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Macri</ENAMEX>
tall, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Magro</ENAMEX> thin, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Grasso</ENAMEX> fat.  They
noted his job: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Ferraro</ENAMEX> made things, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giovanni</ENAMEX>
Vaccaro <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herded cows</ENAMEX>.  Or they tacked on the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> name of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX>, who himself,
reflecting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>'s tangled history, tended to be called
by some version of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Germanic</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saint's</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Testament</ENAMEX> name: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Fabrizio</ENAMEX>
derived his surname from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fabricius</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Alighieri</ENAMEX>
from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aldiger</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Ciccarelli</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Giacobazzi</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob</ENAMEX> .  Whether any
name, through local preference, finally came to end
in the masculine -o , the feminine -a , or the plurals -i
or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-e</ENAMEX> , the root meaning of the name remained the
same.

            Other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> followed the same rules as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruno</ENAMEX> is essentially the same name as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braun or Brown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piccolo</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Magro</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meagher</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maigret</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grasso</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferraro</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> .
But, to the inherent music of their language (would
Rigoletto sound the same if we knew <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuseppe Verdi</ENAMEX>
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Green</ENAMEX>?), the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> added something
more--a game of phonetic theme and variation
seemingly unmatched in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, a game
whose wild rules allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francesco</ENAMEX> to become <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frances</ENAMEX>-chielli
or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Francescuzzi, Cesco</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schetti, Cicco</ENAMEX> or
Zotti, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cicconetti</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciccarelli</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hodges</ENAMEX> list
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no fewer than 90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> surname forms of Giacobo
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob</ENAMEX>) , for instance, and a further <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76</TIMEX> variations of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giacomo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James</ENAMEX>) , itself a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Testament</ENAMEX> derivative
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giacobo</ENAMEX> .  A partial list of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giacomo</ENAMEX> diminutives--
pet names that translate essentially as little
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy</ENAMEX>--is as liquid and intoxicating as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sambuca</ENAMEX>:
Giacomello, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giammelli, Iacomelli, Comello, Comellini</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mello</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giacometti, Giametti, Giamitti, Iacometti</ENAMEX>,
Iamitti, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cometto, Giacomini, Iacomini, Cominello</ENAMEX>,
Comini, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cominetti, Cominotti, Cominoli, Giacomucci</ENAMEX>,
Giacomuzzi, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giamuzzi, Giamusso, Comucci</ENAMEX>,
Comuzzo, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comusso, Mucci, Mucilo, Muccino, Muzzi</ENAMEX>,
Muzzini, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muzzillo, Muzzolo, Muzzullo, Musso, Mussetti</ENAMEX>,
Mussettini, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muselli, Mussili, Mussotti</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mussolini</ENAMEX>,
Giacomozzo, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camosso, Mozzi, Mozzini, Mozzetti</ENAMEX>,
Comolli, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camolli, Comoletti, Camoletto, Commizzoli</ENAMEX>,
Mizzi, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motto, Mottini</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mottinelli</ENAMEX> .

            One can easily see from this list that it is the
suffixes -ello, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-ino</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-etto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-ucci</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-uzzi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-olo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-ozzo</ENAMEX> , and
their variants that allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> to cut James down
to size, and they have the same effect on any other
name.  Inflating him was as simple as tacking the
augmentative suffixes -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or</NUMEX> -oni --as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Giacomoni</ENAMEX> --to
the root name or its variation to get big
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>.

            And, when another approach seemed called for,
some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jameses</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> or overlords started
sticking on the pejorative suffixes -azzo, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-accio</ENAMEX>,
-asso , and their variants, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mazzo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giacomasso</ENAMEX> .
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> cannot easily translate these pejorative
suffixes into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>: they are a malignly ingenious
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> of turning an otherwise perfectly inoffensive
name into an inherently insulting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, of saying
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> , for instance, in such a sneering way that no
add-on adjectives are needed to convey your obvious
but unspecified disdain.  There were times, however,
when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> felt a need to be less subtle.  At
such times, they turned with a vengeance to nicknames.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emidio de Felice</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maestro</ENAMEX> of Italian anthroponymy
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I Cognomi Italiani</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bologna</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Il</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mulino, 1981</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dizionario dei Cognomi</ENAMEX> Italiani
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milano</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Mondadori</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>), has estimated that no
fewer than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 per cent</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surnames</ENAMEX> have
their origin in nicknames.  Not all these nicknames
are bad.  If one is fortunate enough to carry one of
those <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> names beginning with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bon</ENAMEX>- or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buon</ENAMEX>(buono
good), for example, one's value is announced
to all the world: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buonarroti</ENAMEX> (arrota `gain,' from arrogare `to acquire';
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX>, say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hodges</ENAMEX>, was
originally bestowed when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> welcomed the
birth of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>) probably were not surprised that he
turned out so well, although they might have had
even higher hopes for his little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, Buonarroto
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buonarroti</ENAMEX> .  Names beginning with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bel</ENAMEX>- or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bello</ENAMEX>(bello
beautiful) are also historical gifts: someone
called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bellofatto</ENAMEX> (fatto made, put together), probably
has ancestors that were a good-looking lot.  Likewise,
the original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Onestis</ENAMEX> were usually honest and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bevilacquas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bevi drink</ENAMEX>, acqua <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>) usually sober,
while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amantis</ENAMEX> (amante <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX>) usually exhibited
a form of spiritual love that made them seem saintly,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santillis</ENAMEX> (santo sainted), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salvos</ENAMEX> (salvare to
save), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carideos</ENAMEX> (cari dear,' deo god), and Donadios
(dona given, dio god) usually had special relationships
with their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX>.

            But notice that I say usually.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanks</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hodges</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Felice</ENAMEX> say that most of these nicknames
could also be bestowed ironically.  Some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bevilacquas</ENAMEX> drank even less <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> than their wineloving
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">neighbors</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bevivinos</ENAMEX> may have been even
more intemperate); the spiritual love of some Amantis
was directed toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> other than their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> and the patronymic form <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>'Amanti given to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>; some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santillis</ENAMEX> and Salvos
were notably profane; and some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carideos</ENAMEX> and
Donadios were assumed to be dear to or given by
God because no one else stepped forward to explain
how they came to be left on the steps of convents or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monasteries</ENAMEX>.

            There is a whole class of Italian surnames that
were given to foundlings, including variations of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trovato</ENAMEX> (trovato past participle of trovare to find;
trovatello foundling), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proietto</ENAMEX> (proietto ejected or
rejected), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Innocenti</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nocenti</ENAMEX> (given to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
taken into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spedale</ENAMEX> degli Innocenti
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orphanage</ENAMEX>; the name was also given to those who
were innocent of evil, or simple-minded), Ignoto
( ignoto unknown), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Esposito</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sposito</ENAMEX> (esposto
exposed), which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Felice</ENAMEX> has found to be the most
common name in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX>.

            No sense of irony is needed to appreciate the
name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malfatto</ENAMEX> (male badly, fatto made, put together),
however, or the names <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gobbi</ENAMEX> ( gobbo hunchback), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porcelli</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">piglets</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boccioni</ENAMEX> (bocca
mouth plus the augmentative suffix, yielding big
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mouth</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Capostagno</ENAMEX> (capo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, stagno tin), Sozzi
(from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sicilian</ENAMEX> sozzu filthy), or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moccio</ENAMEX> (snot or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slime</ENAMEX>).  Not all of these surnames are terribly common,
but they are all real, appearing in telephone
books in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>.  Some insults
are more common than others.  According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Felice</ENAMEX>'s
extensive studies of phone books and other records
(much of his research is financed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEAT</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>'s telephone service), the most common of all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surnames</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calabria</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rotundo</ENAMEX> , which means
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obese</ENAMEX>.  (Whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> Calabria
was especially filling or its well-fed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> tended
to be more prolific than their thinner <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> is
not clear.)

            Although insulting nicknames form a small fraction
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> surname pool, chances are that
anyone who knows any <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> has participated in
this ancient slanging-match.  I myself have known
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Busa</ENAMEX> , which in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salvatore Battaglia</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grande Dizionario Della Lingua Italiana</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>
equivalent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX>) is defined
as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">il sterco bovino</ENAMEX>, literally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow dung</ENAMEX>.  I
went to high school--a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> with only a minority
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX>--with a girl named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pochintesta</ENAMEX>
( poco little, in in, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">testa head</ENAMEX>), another named
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zucchi</ENAMEX> (a plural form of zucca squash, or, colloquially,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hodges</ENAMEX> say this name was
often given to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> of scarce intelligence, as
in pumpkinhead), one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiappa</ENAMEX> (buttock),
and another named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiappinelli</ENAMEX> (which may
be either an extended diminutive of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiappa</ENAMEX> or the
diminutive of chiappino , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battaglia</ENAMEX> defines as a
type of ape).

            Even my own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> has not escaped.  My
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grandmother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gannuscios</ENAMEX> , have long
known that some distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> spell the name
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cannuscio</ENAMEX> (the softening of hard c to hard g being
very common as words move across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>'s myriad
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dialects</ENAMEX>).  What no one ever told me is that Cannuscio
is very possibly the same word as cannuccio , (the
softening of cci (pronounced chee) to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sci</ENAMEX> (pronounced
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shee</ENAMEX>) being also common.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battaglia</ENAMEX>'s
definition for cannuccio?  Membro genitale.  You
can translate it yourself.

            Insulting surnames generally fall into a few
broad categories.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the largest describes physical
and mental defects.  Someone with a limp was
likely to be called some variation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zoppo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lame</ENAMEX>),
Torti , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Storti</ENAMEX> (torto twisted), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gamba</ENAMEX> or Gambaccini
(gamba leg), or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ciampa</ENAMEX> (ciampare to stumble).
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> who stammered or had some other
speech defect, might be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tartaglia</ENAMEX> (tartagliare to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stutter</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cianciulli</ENAMEX> (cianciugliare to mutter), Sannella
(sanna is an archaic form of zanna tusk), or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mezzalingua</ENAMEX> ( <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mezza half</NUMEX>, lingua tongue).  If one
was hard of hearing or refused good advice, the
name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sordo</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Sorda</ENAMEX> (sordo deaf) might be applied;
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neuromuscular disorders</ENAMEX> might
be called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tremitiedi</ENAMEX> ( tremito bodily trembling).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> perennially under the weather or perhaps
just lazy might be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fiacco</ENAMEX> (feeble) or Stanchi
(stanco tired), while mental impairment earned the
name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Imbrogno</ENAMEX> (imbrogliare to confuse), Moscaincervello
( <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mosca</ENAMEX> fly, in in, cervello brain), or
Infante, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fantazzi</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fanciullo</ENAMEX> (infante infant or
someone of childish intellect).  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> who squinted or
was missing an eye was called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berlusco</ENAMEX> (dialect for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> with a squint) or some variation of Occhi
(occhio eye).  And, demonstrating that in the realm
of insults some things never change, one who wore
glasses became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quattrocchi</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-eyes).

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal kingdom</ENAMEX> provided a rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallos</ENAMEX> (gallo cock or rooster) either sang well or
had active sexual lives, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gazzas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gazzanis</ENAMEX> (gazza
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magpie</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malpighis</ENAMEX> ( male bad, piga a dialect
word for magpie) made a habit of gossiping or collecting
things, and many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Calendris</ENAMEX> and Calandrinos
( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">calandra lark</NUMEX>) were so named because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> believed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">larks</ENAMEX> to be remarkably witless.  Quaglieris
( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">quaglia quail</NUMEX>) were quail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX>.  But Quaglias
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quaglinos</ENAMEX> were either easily frightened, lecherous,
or fat, characteristics that reminded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>.  Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tassos</ENAMEX> ( tasso <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">yew tree</ENAMEX>, anvil, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">badger</ENAMEX>) made their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> near an arboreal landmark
or were ironworkers, but others tended to
sneak around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at night</TIMEX> like certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">weasel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volpes</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">volpe fox</ENAMEX>) were cunning,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orsinos</ENAMEX> ( orso bear) lumbering, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manzos</ENAMEX> ( manzo
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bullock</ENAMEX>) taciturn, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Botolinos</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">botolo</ENAMEX> snapping cur)
irascible, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cagnas</ENAMEX> ( cagna bitch) surly, and Buffas
( <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">buffa Sicilian</ENAMEX> dialect for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">toad</ENAMEX>) detestable.  And you
could always tell when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caprino</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caprini</ENAMEX> was
present ( <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caprino goatlike</ENAMEX> or goat dung).  Nor were
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insects</ENAMEX> ignored: the habitually irritating were either
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zampaglione</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Calabrian</ENAMEX> word for mosquito), or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosca</ENAMEX> (fly), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moscone</ENAMEX> (blue-bottle fly), or some variant
(including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mussolini</ENAMEX> , which, as we have seen,
could be a diminutive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giacomo</ENAMEX> ).

            Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of names--a group <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanks</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hodges</ENAMEX> call imperative surnames, or names formed
by the joining of a verb-stem and a noun--displays
an especially playful method of Italian scurrility.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> lacking in imagination could use Povero (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX>)
or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scarso</ENAMEX> (scarce) to name a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pauper</ENAMEX> or a miser.  But
someone with more linguistic flair could use the imperative
to bestow the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mangiacotti</ENAMEX> ( mangiare
to eat, cotti bricks).  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baro</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barro</ENAMEX> ( baro cheat)
was the boring option for christening <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thieves</ENAMEX>; more
interesting choices included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mangiavacchi</ENAMEX> vacchi a
plural of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">vacca cow</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mangiagalli</ENAMEX> ( gallo rooster),
or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fumagalli</ENAMEX> ( fumare to smoke; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Felice</ENAMEX> says that
such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thieves</ENAMEX> would smoke the chickenkeeper out to
get his charges).  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indelicato</ENAMEX> (indelicate, unscrupulous)
or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inganni</ENAMEX> ( inganno deceit) would do if one
was not to be trusted, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tagliavini</ENAMEX> ( tagliare to
cut, vino `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>; in other words, one who would
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stoop</ENAMEX> to adulterating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>) had a certain extra
punch.  For those who made ends meet by sponging
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mangiapane</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pane bread</ENAMEX>) filled the bill.

            Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of names falls into the either-or
category, in which a well-researched onomastic
history could consign a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> to either comforting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">averageness</ENAMEX> or ignominy.  In the case of Licciardo
and such variants as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Licciardello</ENAMEX> , for instance, the
family's honor depends on whether its origins are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Northern Italian</ENAMEX> Licciardos
can feel at home with all the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rizzardos, Riccardinis</ENAMEX> ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciardos</ENAMEX> --they are just Ricciardos
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>') whose initial R has been transformed by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dialect</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. Southern Licciardos</ENAMEX> , however, have to
make do with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rotundos, Grassos</ENAMEX> ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faucis</ENAMEX> ( fauci gullet): their surname comes from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> dialect word lichard glutton.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fazio</ENAMEX> , another case of either-or, can be a shortening
of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonifazio</ENAMEX> , which means good
fate' and which has been popular in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> owing both
to its meaning and to the fact that it was borne by a
number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">popes</ENAMEX>.  Yet, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fazio</ENAMEX> also means
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">simpleton</ENAMEX>.  The explanation for this coincidence
may lie in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> expression esser <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fra Fazio</ENAMEX> to
be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Brother</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friar) Fazio</ENAMEX>, a colloquialism for to
give away money.  This probably alludes either to
the generosity of some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Bonifazio</ENAMEX> or to the
profligacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pope Boniface VI</ENAMEX>.  In any case, it is
hard not to make the connection that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fazio</ENAMEX> and his
money were soon parted.

            While it seems likely that fazio the noun as well
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fazio</ENAMEX> the name descend from an otherwise benign,
even auspicious name, the history of other
names is not so easy to untangle.  Schettino , for instance,
can be a diminutive of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francesco</ENAMEX> ; but it also
translates as careless.  Likewise, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pazzo</ENAMEX> may have
originally been hacked off the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giacopazzo</ENAMEX> , a
pejorative form of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob</ENAMEX> ; but it also means lunatic.
And although the ancestors of some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Puzzos</ENAMEX> might
have lived near a well ( puzza dialect for pozzo well
or fountain), the forebears of others may have
smelled like a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sewer</ENAMEX> ( puzzo stench).  It is not clear
whether the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possible connotations for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schettino</ENAMEX>,
Pazzo , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puzzo</ENAMEX> are related, as in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fazio</ENAMEX> , or
entirely accidental.  But it does provoke the question,
Do <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> actually think stench when they
meet a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puzzo</ENAMEX> or pumpkinhead when they meet a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zucchi</ENAMEX>?  Did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oriana Fallaci</ENAMEX>'s first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> question
the veracity of her reporting?  ( Fallace fallacious.)
Did the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> in the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Federico Fellini</ENAMEX>'s films
wonder if he would honor their contracts?  ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fellini</ENAMEX>
comes from fello wicked or rascally.)  And is the
wholesome image of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annette Funicello</ENAMEX> spoiled for
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mouseketeers</ENAMEX> who know about the tormento
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dei</ENAMEX> funicelli , or torture of the packthreads, in
which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Neopolitans</ENAMEX> painfully lashed together
the wrists and forearms of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>?

            Or do they too, like non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX>, succumb to
the music of these names and neglect to register
their meaning?  That is my guess.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> are not the
only ones to live with the burden of insulting surnames,
of course.  But it seems likely that the melodic
rise and fall of, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Licciardello</ENAMEX> can deceive
the ear in a way that--just for an example--its German
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">equivalent Schlick</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle High German</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gulp</ENAMEX>) simply cannot.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schneck</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snail</ENAMEX>, slow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>)
sounds like an insult; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zoccadelli</ENAMEX> (nickname for a
stumpy, slow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>) does not.

            Which brings me back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Waldseemuller</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amerigo Vespucci</ENAMEX> and why we should give
thanks that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> fell under the spell of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> name rather than his last.  Where does
Vespucci come from?  It is the diminutive form of
vespa wasp, and was a nickname given to particularly
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ill</ENAMEX>-tempered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.  My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> Henryans
does not sound so bad after all.

            Anyone who embarks on a foreign language,
whether by syllabus in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> or by choice
rather later, soon becomes aware that there are
some special hazards on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fairway</ENAMEX>; to wit, the handling
of proverbs.

            Like many sports, it can be both entertaining
and frustrating at the same time.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>
command the necessary vocabulary and grammar to
translate the words of a proverb, but they cannot be
sure that the end product will be meaningful in the
target language.  For example, how does one say A
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bird</ENAMEX> in the hand is worth <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>?
A literal translation would be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Un</ENAMEX> oiseau dans la
main vaut <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deux dans le buisson</ENAMEX>.  But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
equivalent, or near equivalent, is actually <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Un</ENAMEX> oiseau
dans la main <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaut deux dans la haie</ENAMEX> , A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> in the
hand is worth <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hedge</ENAMEX>.  More to the point,
to express this particular truism the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> are more
likely to say something quite different: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Un</ENAMEX> tiens
vaut mieux <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">que deux tu l'auras</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">One</ENAMEX> here-you-are
is worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than two</NUMEX> you'll-get-it's. 

            How about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>?  There the equivalent is:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Besser ein Spatz</ENAMEX> in der <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hand als eine Taube</ENAMEX> auf dem
Dach , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better</ENAMEX> a sparrow in the hand than a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dove</ENAMEX> on
the roof.  A finer distinction: not just one bird for
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, but a lowly <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> instead of a lofty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.

            Ornithological differences exist elsewhere, too.
Here is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>: He \?\ ,
otherwise Don't promise a crane in
the sky, give me a tit in the hand.  A similar little/
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX>, low/high distinction--that is, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> that are
not exactly of a feather.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>?  M√°s vale p√°jaro en mano que ciento volando ,
Better a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> in the hand than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a hundred</TIMEX> flying.
Again, not quite the same as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.

            So, appreciating that differences exist, from the
slight to the complete, let us look at some more proverbial
equivalents and see if any generalizations
can be drawn regarding their formation or the home
truths they express.  To save space, the following abbreviations
are used for languages quoted: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>,
S = <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>.  Other languages are spelled out.

            
               Better late than never (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>) Mieux vaut tard que
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jamais</ENAMEX> ; (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>) Besser spat als nie ; (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>) \?\;
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>) M√°s vale tarde que nunca .  All exactly
the same!  So it can be done, thank goodness!

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Birds</ENAMEX> of a feather flock together Better proceed
with caution here, could be tricky.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>) Qui se ressemble,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s'assemble</ENAMEX> Those who resemble one another,
gather together: (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>) Gleich und gleich gesellt
sich gern Like and like keep ready <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>)
\?\ A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fisherman</ENAMEX> sees a fisherman from afar; (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>)
Cada oveja con su pareja
Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> with its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>.  Here we have a difference
every time, and a range from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> generality to the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts</ENAMEX> of
the other languages.  But at least almost all the proverbs
incorporate a pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rhyme</ENAMEX> (making them
more memorable), while the German nicely alliterates.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>, too, suggests an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> alternative:
it takes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to know one .

            
               Don't count your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chickens</ENAMEX> before they are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hatched</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>) 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Il</ENAMEX> ne faut pas <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vendre la</ENAMEX> peau de l'ours
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avant de l'avoir</ENAMEX> tu√© You should not sell the skin of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX> before you have killed him; (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Man</ENAMEX> soll
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">die Haut</ENAMEX> nicht verkaufen, ehe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">den B√</ENAMEX>§ren
gefangen hat You should not sell the skin before you
have caught the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>) He \?\
Not having killed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX>, do not sell
the skin; (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>) No <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vendas la piel del oso</ENAMEX> antes de
matarlo Don't sell the skin of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX> before you
have killed him.  The conclusion to be drawn here is
something of a zoological or at any rate ethnic nature:
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX> is far more familiar in continental <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>
than in insular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>.  Indeed, he is still found
there.  (We are talking about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">brown bear</ENAMEX>, Ursus
arctos , not the black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bear</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>,
Euarctos americanus , although that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> is seldom
encountered in much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.)  Moreover,
to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> at least, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX> is
both a valuable <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beast</ENAMEX> (for his hide and meat) and a
symbolic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (standing for strength and power).  But
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX> has long ceased to be a wild denizen of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, so the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> prefer to express the platitude
that one should not promise something one may not
be able to come up with.

            On some <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts</ENAMEX>, however, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> languages
can more or less agree: Don't look a gift <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mouth</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>) √Ä cheval donn√© on ne regarde pax aux
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dents</ENAMEX> : (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>) Einem geschenkten <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaul</ENAMEX> sieht <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> nicht
in's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Maul</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>) \?\ (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>) A caballo regalado, no se
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">le</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mira el diente</ENAMEX> .  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> once again has the agreeable rhyme.

            Encouraged, we proceed to a change of subject:
A new broom sweeps clean (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Il n'est</ENAMEX> rien de tel que
balai neuf There is nothing like a new broom, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Un</ENAMEX>
balai neuf nettoie toujours bien A new broom always
cleans well; (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neue Besen</ENAMEX> kehren gut New brooms
sweep well; (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>) \?\ A new broom sweeps cleanly; (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>)
Escoba <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nueva barre bien</ENAMEX> A new broom sweeps
well.  Again, unity and concord.

            But there is a hazard coming up: It is no use
crying over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spilt milk</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>) Ce qui <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">est fait est</TIMEX> fait What
is done is done; (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>) Was geschehen ist, ist geschehen
What has happened, has happened; (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>) \?\
What has been written with the pen cannot be hacked out
with an axe; (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>) A lo hecho, pecho To what has been
done, courage [literally breast].  Here we have the
philosophical generality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>
with the stoical stance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> and the more
colorful imagery of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>,
too, have an equally vivid turn of phrase, although,
come to think of it, who is likely to shed real tears
over an overturned milkjug?  (Yes, that is the image I
have, too.  But the source of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">proverb</ENAMEX> lies
not in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> but in teats: it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX> who has
kicked the bucket, and the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dairymaid</ENAMEX> who
weeps over her lost labor.)

            A pattern is already emerging of varying traditions
and differing national identities: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">maid</ENAMEX> mourns the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> woodman
cannot alter the written word, hack and hew he
never so well.  On the other hand, many lands see
the world with a single eye: a new broom does
sweep better than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with worn-out bristles.

            Sometimes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> needs to name the right names
in the search for an equivalent proverb:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> was not built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paris n'est</ENAMEX> pas

The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> pick not their capital, however, but
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ancient Zamora</ENAMEX>, famous for its stand against the invading

is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zamora</ENAMEX> was not conquered in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX>).  It is fair
to say, though, that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniard</ENAMEX> might equally side
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>, and more
generally add: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ni Roma se fund√≥</ENAMEX> luego toda nor

patriotically declare <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nie</ENAMEX> od razu <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krak√≥w</ENAMEX> zbudowano
(not <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX>, you notice), he too could well prefer to
throw in his lot with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX>: Nie Jednego Rzym

            Talking of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX>, one should bear in mind that
almost all proverbs, however modern, however nationalistic,
will have had a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> original or prototype.
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proverbs</ENAMEX> cited above thus
have respective equivalents as follows: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Plus</ENAMEX> valet

have a sparrow in the hand than a crane in doubt;

literally Late than never better; Sic fuit, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">est et</TIMEX> erit:

of course, of course).

            So when seeking a foreign proverbial parallel,
proceed with care.  You might get away with an exact
word-for-word equivalent, but more than likely
you might not.  As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> had it, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Festina</ENAMEX> lente!
            
         
         
            
In physics, where other forms of misconduct are relatively
rare, I have seen serious breeches of ethics committed
under the cloak of anonymity by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">referees</ENAMEX> of journal
articles and research proposals.  [<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">From The American</ENAMEX>

            Leaping quantums!


            There is a weekly television program with the
general title <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum Leap</ENAMEX>.  When I hear or read
that term--or quantum jump , as it is also put--I cannot
keep from imagining enchanting little quantums
(or quanta) having fun leaping over walls and madly
jumping up and down.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Concise Oxford Dictionary</ENAMEX>
defines quantum as a discrete quantity of energy
proportional in magnitude to the frequency of
radiation it represents. Ah, yes.  And it has this for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantum</ENAMEX> jump (or leap ): an abrupt transition in an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atom</ENAMEX> or molecule from one quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to another.
Of course.

            For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> quantum leap (or jump ) belonged
exclusively to the physicists, but during the
past quarter-century or so it has come to be used
metaphorically by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> who like to
flaunt that sort of thing.  It now designates a sudden,
spectacular, extensive change in a program or policy
or process--a major breakthrough, or something
along that line.  But long before the physicists got
hold of quantum it was used by ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> reports that quantum (from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
quantus: how much, how great) has been used in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early in the 17th century</TIMEX>.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1786</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Burns</ENAMEX> used it in his poem,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epistle</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Young</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friend</ENAMEX>, in which he, interestingly,
warned against casual sexual indulgence: I
waive the quantum o' the sin, / The hazard of concealing;
/ But, och! it hardens a' within, / And petrifies
the feeling.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> does not give <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burns</ENAMEX>'s use
of the word as an example, but other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scots</ENAMEX> may have
been influenced by it.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Carlyle</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1857</TIMEX>,
wrote of Some smaller quantum of earthly enjoyment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Caird</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theologian</ENAMEX> and philosopher,
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1877</TIMEX> offered this observation: All phenomena,
as perceived, are extensive quanta.  (I must memorize
that: it could useful as a conversation muddler.)
The OED <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Supplement</ENAMEX> devotes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly seven</NUMEX> columns
to quantum and compounds in which it is used.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> point out that in physics a quantum leap
is actually a very small change, but nevertheless a
significant one.  Despite the illogical element in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">popular</ENAMEX>, metaphorical use of the phrase, it does
seem to have become firmly imbedded in current
discourse.  But perhaps it has already become what
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fowler</ENAMEX> called a battered ornament.

            While reading about quantum in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED Supplement</ENAMEX> ,
I noticed the preceding word, quantophrenia ,
which is defined as A term used for an obsession
with and exaggerated reliance upon mathematical
methods or results, especially in research connected
with the social sciences.  It also gives quantophrenic .
Useful words, clinically.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lexicographic Quirks and Whimsy</ENAMEX>



            
               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lexicographer</ENAMEX> ...A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> of dictionaries; a
harmless drudge, that busies himself in tracing
the original, and detailing the signification of
words.

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>
               
            

            Whether mainstream <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lexicographers</ENAMEX> are harmless
is very much open to doubt, but
drudges they certainly are.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s definition,
curiously, marks one of those rare occasions when
the drudge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> against his drudgery and defiantly
indulges in a moment's humor or whimsy.  The lexicographic
mind, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambrose Bierce</ENAMEX> observed in one
of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> columns, is a merely human affair
and will occasionally cut its capers.

            Such humor or whimsy tends, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s work
at any rate, to be of a fairly cynical turn--in keeping
both with his general opinionatedness and with his
specific feelings of demoralization while compiling
the dictionary in the run-up to its publication in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755</TIMEX>.  Hence those various other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> chestnuts of
his:


<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oats</ENAMEX>... A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX>, which in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> is generally
given to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>, but in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX> supports the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron</ENAMEX>... <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> who countenances, supports or
protects.  Commonly a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wretch</ENAMEX> who supports
with insolence, and is paid with flattery.

pension... An allowance made to any one without
an equivalent.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> it is generally
understood to mean pay given to a state hireling
for treason to his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.

            

            (The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynical Definition</ENAMEX> went on to become a kind of
literary genre, thanks especially to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrose Bierce</ENAMEX>.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s opposite number in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noah Webster</ENAMEX>, was hardly a wit of the same order,
but he too seems to have occasionally injected a
(somewhat plodding) cynical humor into the definitions
in his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionary</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1828</TIMEX>:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viceregent</ENAMEX>... A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenant</ENAMEX>; a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vicar</ENAMEX>; an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>
who is deputed by a superior or by proper authority
to exercise the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX> of another.
Kings are sometimes called God's viceregents.
It is to be wished they would always deserve
the appellation.
            

            It is possible that much of the supposed humor
in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Webster's dictionary</ENAMEX> is unintentional--a 20th
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> response to his earnestly homiletic approach
to lexicography.  Certainly some of his definitions--really,
short moral tracts--cannot fail to
arouse a condescending smile <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, so quaint do
they seem across a distance of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">165 years</TIMEX>.  The entry
at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice</ENAMEX> , for instance, ends with these helpful words:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice</ENAMEX> is rarely a solitary <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">invader</ENAMEX>; it usually brings
with it a frightful <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX>.
            

            The monumental <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX>
[ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> ], now in its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> edition and filling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> vast
volumes, contains many extremely quaint definitions
that were written <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a hundred years ago</TIMEX> or more and
remain unrevised:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">am≈ìba</ENAMEX>... A microscopic animalcule (class
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protozoa</ENAMEX>) consisting of a single cell of gelatinous
sarcode, the outer layer of which is highly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extensile</ENAMEX> and contractile, and the inner fluid
and mobile, so that the shape of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> is
perpetually changing.
            

            And this from an edition published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> and purportedly
up to date!

            Unintended humor in dictionaries would usually
originate elsewhere.  First, simply, in a severe
error within the definition.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionary</ENAMEX>,
which I cannot identify, apparently defines the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> slang term pooftah as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> (possibly
a misfire for an effeminate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, a secondary
sense nowadays, after a male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual</ENAMEX>).  It is
difficult to explain to a non-Brit just how funny this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misdefinition</ENAMEX> is--almost as funny as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s attempt
at defining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wicket-keeper</ENAMEX> : the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">cricket</ENAMEX> who stands with a bat to protect the wicket
from the ball.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">One</ENAMEX> might expect bilingual dictionaries
to abound in such confusions, yet I have no
record of any: simple mistakes, yes, but nothing in
the least risible).

            Early dictionaries are obviously riddled with bizarre
errors of fact.  In what is probably the very first
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">English dictionary</ENAMEX>, published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1623</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cockeram</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unskeptically</ENAMEX> defines animals according
to current folklore: the ignarus singeth <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> kinds of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">notes</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> after another, as, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">la-sol</ENAMEX>-me-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fa</NUMEX>-me-re-ut
(there is no arguing when the details are so specific);
the barble is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Fish</ENAMEX> that will not meddle with the
baite untill with her taile she have unhooked it from
the hooke.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathan Bailey</ENAMEX>, whose dictionary of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1721</TIMEX> was to guide-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s own work, happily defined
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loriot</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Oriole</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> that,
being looked upon by one who has the yellow jaundice,
cures the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and dies himself.

            Errors may be typographical rather than lexicographical.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> gremlin has a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> streak, I notice.
Here are a couple of his pranks:

mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> and east <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, were
systematically put to death by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazis</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk products</ENAMEX>.]
            

            Next, the wackiness of the concept or word itself,
whose dutiful definition cannot fail to provoke a
gasp of comic disbelief--wackiness often being in
direct proportion to rudeness.  Bilingual dictionaries
are the major source:


raphanidoo thrust a radish up the fundament, a

            These call for special treatment.

            
               Defenestration the act of throwing someone out
of a window is probably too familiar to attract notice
of how wacky it is, but what about the following?:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sooterkin</ENAMEX>... <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">afterbirth</ENAMEX> allegedly

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>.  [<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chambers English Dictionary</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>]
            

            
               OED2e avoids spelling out the definition of merkin
in this way, but does add the following mind-spinning
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">citation</ENAMEX>:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Variant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> interviewed a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> public wig

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> making merkins and other intimate
wigs.
            

            The implications here are stupendous--not just that
there are types of intimate wig other than merkins,
but also that there are several other merkin-factories
round the world vying for the honor of
most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>, and a great many more such
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> that are of lesser importance.

            Next, a comic disproportion between the simplicity
of the word being defined and the earnestly
detailed complexity of the definition:


network... Any thing reticulated or decussated,
at equal distances, with interstices between the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intersections</ENAMEX>. [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> again.]

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merriam-Webster III</ENAMEX>'s weirdest definitions
are the famously convoluted wordings at the main
senses of door and hotel .

            Then, the monumentally unsuccessful definition,
with a bizarre failure to elucidate-- ignotum
per ignotius , explaining the unknown by means of
the incomprehensible:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cactolith</ENAMEX>... A quasi-horizontal chonolith composed
of anastomising ductoliths, whose distal
ends curl like a harpolith, thin like a sphenolith,

            Serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> are likely to let down their
hair more often in the examples they choose or construct
to illustrate a meaning than in the wording of
the definitions themselves.  To illustrate the expletive
use of the word damn , for instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.C. Wyld</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Dictionary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX>
[<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Routledge</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sons</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1932</TIMEX>] prints the
phrase damn this dictionary .  To illustrate the sense
and syntax of partial `having a particular liking for a
different <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Universal Dictionary</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reader's Digest</ENAMEX>

cigarettes and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX> .

            The recently published <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford Thesaurus</ENAMEX> , by

being killed.
            

            The zaniest example I know of occurs in a bilingual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionary</ENAMEX> published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ensk</ENAMEX>-Islensk
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ordab√≥k</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Icelandic Dictionary</ENAMEX>] of Sigurour
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orn Bogason</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">headword toad</ENAMEX> is duly glossed, as
padda, karta , and then--quite needlessly--illustrated,
with this remarkably elucidating sentence:
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">toad</ENAMEX> was delighted to see his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> again .
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bogason</ENAMEX>'s dictionary is notable for another curious
feature: the entry for the word disappear was somehow
omitted, or perhaps it simply disappeared.  Was
it a deliberate joke, comparable to the omission,
from the spellcheck subroutine of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">WordPerfect 5.0</NUMEX>,
of lost?)
            

            To return to whimsical definitions.  The mainstream
lexicographic minds that cut far and away the
most capers to relieve the drudgery are those that
have compiled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chambers English Dictionary</ENAMEX> over
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edinburgh</ENAMEX>; latest edition, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>].  (Previous
contributions to VERBATIM have noted some of
these: see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XV</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, p. 5</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, p. 18</ENAMEX>.)  The game began
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly a century ago</TIMEX> with the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1898</TIMEX> edition, under
its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor Rev.</ENAMEX>  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Davidson</ENAMEX> (any relation
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.A. Davidson</ENAMEX>, who wrote the article in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XV</ENAMEX> ,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).  Through the dictionary's various editions and
changes of name, the whimsical definitions waxed
and waned, until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1972</TIMEX> edition purged almost all
of them from the text.  Following a great deal of outraged
protest from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traditionalist readers</ENAMEX>, most of the
famous definitions were rehabilitated in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>
edition and can still be found in the current edition.
Let them now speak for themselves.  Here is a selection
of the best (those marked with an asterisk are
not in the current edition, never having been reinstated
after an earlier expulsion).

            Further to the comment in the review of the
20th <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Century Brewer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVIII,4</NUMEX> ]: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hashbury</ENAMEX> is a derivation
from the names of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> intersecting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streets</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haight</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ashbury</ENAMEX> .  The neighborhood,
often known as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Haight or The Haight</ENAMEX>-Ashbury
was, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hippie</ENAMEX>/
flower <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> movement.  It is certainly true that the
main <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> used was grass, but there was widespread
drug experimentation, with so much familiarity with
hash that the play on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> words hash, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haight</ENAMEX> ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashbury</ENAMEX> was inevitable.

            Perhaps the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Brewer</ENAMEX> does mention this
background, and my comments are redundant.



         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John A. Fust</ENAMEX> suggests [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ] that I list to a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canutian</ENAMEX> position in an effort to drag the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populace</ENAMEX>
from such aberrations as It's me.  Fust labels my
view, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canutian</ENAMEX>... more gracious than the
jargonal, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Knutty</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sage</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatauqua</ENAMEX> asks,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rhetorically</ENAMEX>.


Could anyone imagine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX>... sitting in
the grandstand at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yankee Stadium</ENAMEX>, hot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> (with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mustard</ENAMEX>) in hand, asking, Whom are you rooting
for?
            

            Such a gaffe would have been mind-boggling from
the author of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Who the Bells Tolled For ...</ENAMEX>



         
         
            More <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Prison</ENAMEX> Slang



            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slang</ENAMEX> collected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huntsville</ENAMEX>
is that used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>, not by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.  Some of the expressions originated during
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">riots</ENAMEX>, or thrill killings, or both.  <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Prisons</ENAMEX> are ugly;
so are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>; so is the slang.

            Before prison reforms of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prisons</ENAMEX> were run mostly by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> who were
strictly accountable to strategically scattered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX>,
comparatively few in number.  Many of the disciplinary
measures then used by state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervising prisoners</ENAMEX> are now illegal.  With or without
the knowledge of state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, torture to the
point of death was not uncommon, and some of the
words in the following list refer to torture.  It is evident
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">torturers</ENAMEX> had several different motives:
to humiliate, crush, or punish the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX>; to force
him to cooperate; to learn the location of valuables
outside; to assert one prison <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gang</ENAMEX>'s dominance
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another</TIMEX>; to give the torturer a macho trip.

            Even after the reforms, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> is far more dangerous
than most non-prison environments.  But reforms
led to more direct state supervision, more
prison <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were built, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> became less
like a huge collection of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hellish sardine</NUMEX> cans.  Although
the long overdue reforms came, the slang
lingers on.

            Some of the following expressions, like writ
room, must have had their beginnings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tranquillity</ENAMEX>.  Not so with words like skill and singarette .
The spellings of a few of the words, like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">singarette</ENAMEX> and worman, are attempts at reflecting
their pronounciation, for they have no spelled tradition.

            Some areas of the world are particularly rich in
strange names, and my own--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banff</ENAMEX> and Buchan
district in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grampian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>--must be one of the
best.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toddlehills</ENAMEX>?  Or would you rather go to pot at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mill of</ENAMEX>

Whigabuts, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rashypans, Waggle Hill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clattering-briggs</ENAMEX>,
or Crawheat?
            

            You could have a very gay time on Happyhillock
or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merryhillock</ENAMEX>, a rotten time on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rottenhill</ENAMEX>, a gruesome
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallowhills</ENAMEX>, and it is up to you what
you do on Ballhill !  How would a trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spital</ENAMEX> grab

            Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freud</ENAMEX>, so far as I know, did not discuss
Spoonerisms on his classic analysis of slips-of-the-tongue,
his theories as to the psychoanalytic implications
of transposed sounds, such as those attributed
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spooner</ENAMEX>, could have been usefully added to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Learn To Spike Lunars</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>] by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Archibald</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>.  Let me suggest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> examples:

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spooner</ENAMEX>'s most widely quoted slip was his firm
announcement to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>, You have hissed my
mystery lecture.  The conventional response to this
amusing transposition is A funny jab at a recalcitrant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pupil</ENAMEX>.  However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freud</ENAMEX>, I am sure, would
have stressed how the slip reveals anxieties that all
lecturers, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spooner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> about addressing
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>.  For example, hissed...my
lecture clearly reflects a reality that few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX>
are willing to voice: that their gems of wisdom are
not universally praised--in fact, are sometimes denounced,
usually in private, as platitudinous and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">simplistic</ENAMEX>.  In like fashion, my mystery lecture exposes
the unconscious fear of obfuscation, turgidity,
and other obstacles to clarity on the part of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>.  In both of these instances, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freud</ENAMEX> would argue
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spooner</ENAMEX> merely voiced what has long been
repressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Academe</ENAMEX>.

            Another case: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Television</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Mudd</ENAMEX>,
in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early days</TIMEX> as a radio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcer</ENAMEX>, was called
upon to present an update on the ill health of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX>.  The announcement came out as, The condition
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pipe Pois</ENAMEX> grows steadily worse.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mudd</ENAMEX>, roaring
with laughter, immediately blanked out the
sound.  Back in control, he meant to say, The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> has summoned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swiss</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX>, but this, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mudd</ENAMEX>'s chagrin, came out as
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> has summoned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican</ENAMEX> a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX>.

            If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freud</ENAMEX> had had his say on the significance of
this Spoonerism he would probably have assumed
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mudd</ENAMEX> unconsciously voiced not only his unspoken
disrespect for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX> but also gave vent to the
universally repressed notion that it is conceivable
that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX> could be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual</ENAMEX>.

            I am not suggesting that all the fun should be
taken out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spoonerisms</ENAMEX>; but, when transposed
sounds reveal profound universal anxieties, then
perhaps we should go beyond merely enjoying a
good laugh.



         
         

            I enjoyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Archibald Ford</ENAMEX>'s article on
spoonerisms, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Learn to Spike Lunars</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>].  He
and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, if they appreciate the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> language,
will realize that slips of the tongue in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language are laughably unfunny to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> who speak the only language in the world
that lends itself so beautifully to what they call a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contr√®peterie .</ENAMEX>

            For the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, in all walks of life, to render
one sound for another is not a slip but an art, practised
equally studiously in bistros as well as in the
salons of nobles, academicians, and beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
When translated into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> the words and
thoughts that are spirituel [in the sense of witty] or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cochon</ENAMEX> [in the sense of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">licentious</ENAMEX>] become crude
locker-room obscenities.  Many translations into
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> of the nouns le con and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la queue</ENAMEX>, for example,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grate</ENAMEX>.  They shock with sound, and not always
with image.  But these, and like words, when formed
in the mouth and on the lips of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> are soft,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inviting</ENAMEX>, amusing.  The f-verb in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> is the same
as for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kiss</ENAMEX>: baiser .  Calling a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> a con is not insulting
until you change your mind and add that he has
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ni la douceur</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ni la profondeur</ENAMEX> of that lovable object.
For the most part, what is irreverent, scatological, or
pornographic in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> sounds benign, and is, of
course, plein <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">d'esprit</ENAMEX> .

            (It is not within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of this letter to
delve into the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX> and male sexual organs
and ponder why they have reversed genders.
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, it just fits.)

            I have never come across a contrep√®terie that
was not off-color or irreverent, or touched on sex.
That is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gallic</ENAMEX>, I guess.  Let us start with irreverence:

Femme <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">folle √† la</ENAMEX> messe
vs.
Femme <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">molle √† la</ENAMEX> fesse
--Rabelais
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX> joyeuse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> du <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap</ENAMEX>
not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX> joyeuse copulation du Pape
            

            (A high-school <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">French-English dictionary</ENAMEX> will
handle most of these.  For the vulgar meanings of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of the words in the last contrep√®teries, something
like Le Petit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert: Dictionnaire de la Langue</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Francaise</ENAMEX> will be needed.  I cringe at having to put
those innocuous words into feelthy <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grounds Maintenance</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Economics</ENAMEX>
(including sex in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>):

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Il</ENAMEX> ne faut pas glisser <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dans la</ENAMEX> piscine
do not say
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Il</ENAMEX> ne faut pas pisser <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dans la</ENAMEX> glycine
            

            is the genus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisteria</ENAMEX> in the plant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le</ENAMEX> linge qui s√©che
but not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le</ENAMEX> singe qui l√©che
Madame: votre mouton bouille
not
Madame: votre bouton mouille
            

            Sex in the drawing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>:

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX> duchesse <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">braquait sa lorgnette sur le jeune</ENAMEX> homme
qui descendait en ballon
vs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX> duchesse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lorgnait la braquette du jeune</ENAMEX> homme
qui d√©bandait dans le salon
            

            To prove by exception, I bring this to an end
with a contrep√®terie employing a word that sounds
shitty even in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX>:

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX> philanthropie de l'ouvrier charpentier
not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX> tripe en folie de l'ouvrier partant chier
            

            I would like to thank all my <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> who
have furthered my contrepeteric education.  Although
there are many volumes of collections of contrep√®terie,
I would be delighted to learn of fresh and
new ones--even clean ones.

            Afterthoughts: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Speaking of/</ENAMEX>in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, I am surprised
that no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> has yet commented on the Colonial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American English</ENAMEX> 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alamode</ENAMEX> ( v .), [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>].  It
might have been a very over here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1796</TIMEX>, but for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, then as now, it is adjectival.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">√Ä la</ENAMEX> mode in
the fashion [of]' is generally followed by a place
name: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tripes √† la</ENAMEX> mode <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Caen</ENAMEX> .  The abbreviated
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boeuf √† la</ENAMEX> mode --no geography necessary for this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> plat du jour --is, of course, and as correctly
described in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amelia Simmons</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Cookery</ENAMEX>,
a round of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Beef cooked</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>.



         
         

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Weinberg</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPISTOLA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>] regarding
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> word for railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bryson</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Know-How</ENAMEX>, No Problem [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>] deserves
a comment: While loan words often undergo
vast changes in meaning when introduced into a new
language, the change from the whole to one of at
least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of its parts (assuming there would have
been a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First</ENAMEX> Class waiting room for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volksaal</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ] to
make sense) in this case seemed too far-fetched.
And phonetically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volk</ENAMEX> ... which has an initial f-sound
seemed too removed from vag ... to apply.
Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langenscheidt</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pocket Dictionary</ENAMEX>
has the entry fol'klor which reflects the
sound correctly (the letter l has a soft sign after it),
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meaning Volkskunst</ENAMEX> or folklore.  The dictionary
also gives vokzal, stressed on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> syllable, as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bahnhof</ENAMEX> or railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>.  It turns out, then,
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bryson</ENAMEX>'s rendering of the word in his article,
vagzal, is the phonetic spelling rather than the transcription
of the word.

            Although zal is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saal</ENAMEX> large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volk</ENAMEX> ... part is very implausible.  On the other
hand, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX>, au -sound, and x in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vauxhall</ENAMEX> are satisfactorily
represented by the VOKS sequence so that the
etymology given by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryson</ENAMEX> appears to be preferable.



         
         

            Further to voksal --<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> for railway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>--although
not to its etymology.  In the early
1950s, before overflight and satellite programs had
been developed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> included amongst its collection
programs one of briefing selected travelers
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> and debriefing them on their
return.  These were not recruited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, simply
assets.

            There were numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> and other installations
to which no access was possible, which
were encapsulated in small triangles (or sometimes
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rectangles</ENAMEX>) formed by the nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railroads</ENAMEX>.
By carefully briefing an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> who was to
travel that road or rail line as to the beginning and
end of the bounding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> and having him make a
count a count of electrical, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, or gas lines crossing
the stretch and of side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, rail spurs, and the
like, it was possible, after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> legs had been
traversed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> to make surprisingly
accurate estimates of the size and significance--even
the nature--of the targeted installation.

            One mysterious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> was enclosed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> and a rail line, little used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX>,
on which the only scheduled train passed the required
checkpoints in the dead of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.  The roads
were no problem, but it took a year to find an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> with an excuse to travel that rail
line--and he spoke no <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>.  He was, however,
taught the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyrillic</ENAMEX> alphabet and could transcribe
signs.

            On his return, he reported phenomenal luck.
There had been a lengthy unscheduled stop at a
small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 a.m.</TIMEX>, thanks to a hot box, and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> had been allowed off the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> to
stretch their legs.  He had wandered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX>
yards up the line where he had found, crossing it, a
large cluster of transmission lines, an oil line, assorted
piping, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> with, even at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that hour</TIMEX>,
heavy truck traffic.  He was not quite sure all this
was within the specified stretch of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX>, as it was
pitch black and the best we had been able to give
him was an estimate of the times the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> would
enter and leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>.  But he made a careful
count of everything and copied down the name of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> from the sign on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station platform</ENAMEX>.

            What was it?  we asked eagerly.

            Voksal, he proudly replied.




         
         

            In my upcoming <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek Tragedies</ENAMEX>, I often refer
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chorus</ENAMEX>.  The problem is whether or not to
consider the noun singular.  That depends.  In some
contexts, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chorus</ENAMEX> is thought of as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> (as it is in
this very sentence).  We would not say, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Chorus</ENAMEX>
are thought of as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>.  But there are times when
the noun seems to cry out for a plural verb:


The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Chorus</ENAMEX> enter shortly after, almost in panic at
the threatened attack by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polyneices</ENAMEX>.

            

            The word panic, at least to me, suggests individual
reactions.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> panic.  Collective nouns do not.
Sometimes the distinction is almost metaphysical.

            The following classic pair of sentences makes
the point more unequivocally:


My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is going to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are taking separate vacations.

            

            I wish my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Chorus contexts</ENAMEX> were as easy to decide.



         
         

            The review of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Webster</ENAMEX>
Dictionary [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>] gave space to the matter of inconsistent
hyphenation, which I appreciated, and I
also agreed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">reviewer</ENAMEX>'s comments regarding
the admittance of so-called naughty bits into the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX>.  But I was surprised, upon reading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>'s
review of this dictionary [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 24, 1991</TIMEX>], to realize
that there were issues raised there that were not
touched upon in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>.  I wish attention had
been given to these rather than some of those to
which space was devoted, ones I consider of less
consequence, such as the use of the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>,
the dating of words such as ordinals, and the cost of
the dictionary in per-word terms--and the cost of
college dictionaries in general.  While each of these
subjects is of interest, they pale in comparison to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">central</ENAMEX> issued raised in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> review, namely of
whether a dictionary is better simply because it has
more words in it, words which are included if only to
mirror the language of the moment, e.g. womyn
( pl .), herstory, waitron, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirandize</ENAMEX> .

            In short, just because a new word has been
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coined</ENAMEX> does not mandate its publication in dictionaries
in the frequency to which we have become victim
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past thirty-odd years</TIMEX>.  I have no statistics
to back me up, but it is my impression that, as
the rate of publication of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">dictionaries</ENAMEX> has increased
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few decades</TIMEX>, the fabrication of
new words has similarly increased.  A kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson's</ENAMEX>
Law may be in effect here: words will increase
in number to occupy the pages <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> are willing
to print.  Meanwhile, can we not say that accurate
use of the language has declined, both in the
meaning of words and in their syntax?  Or, put another
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>, have we not become too lazy to look
things up in the dictionary and too prone instead to
make up another word in place of the one we have
forgotten or never learned in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place?

            I would like to think that a college <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">dictionary</ENAMEX> is
best which is easy to use because it answers basic
questions about commonly used vocabulary: spelling,
pronounciation, meaning, part of speech, synonym,
and antonym.  Perhaps, because it probably
serves most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> as the single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> for such
matters, it should also include those addenda which,
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">9th</NUMEX>, consume <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">188</NUMEX> pages, e.g. a list of
abbreviations, a gazetteer, etc.  However, let it become
cluttered with etymologies, essays, and vocabulary
that, I think, belong in more encyclopedic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tomes</ENAMEX> and published at less frequent intervals, and
the result is a cumbersome volume that I, for one,
would not be inclined to use as the handy reference
a college dictionary implies.

            Would a lexicographer agree?



         
         

            I have been entertained by the discussions of
computerized hyphenation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>].  There
is no one alive who is more enthusiastic about computers
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">than I.</ENAMEX>  For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing, I make my living by
manipulating words on them.  Whether it is right to
abandon any part of the creative process to them,
however, is another.

            And creativity is indeed involved in hyphenation--not
in recognizing rules and conventions and
exceptions, but rather in deciding whether (and
how) to apply those rules, conventions, and exceptions.

            The decision is often aesthetic, which is where
computers are useless.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> may hyphenate, but
should one?  No hyphenation algorithm has been invented
to control rivers of white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>, nor to distinguish
between pro-ject (verb) and proj-ect (noun,
unless one is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX>).

            Someday, however, even that may change.  After
all, it has been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</TIMEX>, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early days</TIMEX> of computerized
typesetting, that I've seen anything to compare
with the single article about sexual dysfunction
in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> that contained these two
algorithm-driven hyphenations: the<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-rapist</ENAMEX> and
mole-ster.



         
         

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OBITER DICTA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">XVIII, 4, 15</ENAMEX>], you remark that
older has come to mean, in certain contexts at least,
less old than old.  I have another example, well established
although not part of the vernacular, of a
comparative gone into reverse.  Real-estate firms
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> around here routinely use newer on written
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> descriptions to mean recent but not new.
For fear of litigation the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> use new only if
the roof, carpet, or whatever was replaced at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of listing.  Even recent is avoided because it is
thought to imply something newer than newer,
whereas a furnace <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to two years old</TIMEX> can safely be
described as newer .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Customers</ENAMEX> sometimes inquire
about the word and laugh when it is translated; it is
confined to print and may be considered an encapsulated
piece of real-estate trade jargon without the
currency of your older .



         
         

            As an adjunct to your article on PC [‚ÄúPolitically
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Correct Nomenclature</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>], I submit the following
output of my PC (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Personal Computer</ENAMEX>).

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHL</ENAMEX> is planning an expansion franchise in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.  The mascot is to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lightnings</ENAMEX>.
Since I am a degreed electrical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX>, I must do a
lot of soul-searching to determine if any of my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother engineers</ENAMEX> and electricians should be offended.
I mean that, if some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX> (and
the usual liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protesters</ENAMEX>) are being offended by
such mascots as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiefs</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redskins</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>,
maybe the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHL</ENAMEX> ought to consider the feelings
of us <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nerds</ENAMEX> .  After all, I can visualize such headlines
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Coach</ENAMEX> fails to spark <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lightnings</ENAMEX>, Lightnings
strike twice in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bruins</ENAMEX> singed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lightnings</ENAMEX>,
etc.  How can anybody conceive of such insensitivity
on the part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHL</ENAMEX>?
            



         
         
            Name Withheld



            Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> and especially recently, in connection
with the publication of the vast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omni</ENAMEX> Gazetteer
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States of America</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omnigraphics</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> have commented on
the curious and funny names one can find in almost
any listing of place names.  I have seen no criticism,
however, of the total lack of imagination evident in
the naming of many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX>, boulevards,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streets</ENAMEX>, etc.  On a recent expedition by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, I noted a
large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> with names like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">P Avenue</ENAMEX>, Q
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenue</ENAMEX>, and the like, and everyone is familiar with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> names in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> , that reflect the
same sort of thing.

            One can easily understand the desire of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committees</ENAMEX> responsible for such things to number
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streets</ENAMEX>, then designate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> numbers in such a way
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strangers</ENAMEX> can readily get the idea that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65-42</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">83rd Street</ENAMEX> is on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">83rd Street</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">65th Avenue</ENAMEX>,
and I can find nothing to quarrel with in that practice.
Also, the simple system used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>
for numbering <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and (most) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> above
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington Square</ENAMEX> makes sense, as anyone who has
been to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, or any other old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> might agree.

            But surely there are more interesting ways in
which <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> can be named.  For example, they
could be named after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> (or foreign) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, constellations, foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statesmen</ENAMEX>, famous operas, opera
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">singers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composers</ENAMEX>, works of fiction, music, and
art, novelists, poets, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, characters
in fiction or mythology, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX> --the supply is almost inexhaustible.
Moreover, if it is deemed advisable to have the
names in alphabetical order to make it easy to find a
given <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, it would be a simple matter to put <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX>
Street between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lisbon Streets</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bach Boulevard</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> and Copland
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boulevards</ENAMEX> followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debussy</ENAMEX> .  If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>
are predominantly of a particularly ethnic stock,
they might like to commemorate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Spanish poets, or Greek playwrights</ENAMEX>; if they are of a
classical bent, they can find names of important
works of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> literature; on the other
hand, if they like modern music, they can name their
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> after rock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>.  The procedure
would require a little research in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, but
that would not be onerous.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the problems with existing names is that
they can be misleading or ambiguous: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sound View</ENAMEX>
Drive, for instance, has not afforded a view of the
Sound since all those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> were built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>.
Was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank Street</ENAMEX> named after someone named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX>,
because it was near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of a river (which has
now been moved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> blocks away because the
land was filled in), because the town <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> was once
on it, or because it was where they used to bank
fires?  How many Sunrise <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highways</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sunset</ENAMEX> Boulevards
are there?  It is not suggested that well-established,
traditional names be changed, only that
boring names be replaced by interesting ones.  One
would expect that a certain amount of common
sense be exercised: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palm Drive</ENAMEX> and Bougainvillea
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boulevard</ENAMEX> would be as out of place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yucca Lane</ENAMEX>; with the devastation wrought by
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">elm</ENAMEX> disease, one might consider renaming all
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Elm Street</ENAMEX> to describe
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hardier species</ENAMEX>.  An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> with which I have occasion
to do business is at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">123 Elm Street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old</ENAMEX>
Saybrook, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, and I cannot help feeling
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie</ENAMEX> lurks there, ready to strike down the
unwary.  But then, although I formerly owned a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> (in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Essex</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>) where the film, Let's
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Scare Jessica to Death</ENAMEX> was made, I have survived that
peril.  In this vein, I do not advocate naming a street
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bubo Boulevard or Plague Place</ENAMEX> .  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bridgeport</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>,
I have seen a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lesbia Street</ENAMEX> , which arouses all
sorts of untoward speculation.

            Obviously, one must be careful: few people
would want to have to say that they live on Hyena
Highway or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anteater Avenue</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vulture Drive</ENAMEX>; but
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Coyote Canyon Drive</ENAMEX> offers some alliteration, Chipmunk
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Way</ENAMEX> sounds cute, and who could object to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raccoon Road</ENAMEX>?  The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> leading to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Laurel Heights</ENAMEX>
(where the editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> are situated
and which is, believe it or not, somewhat elevated
from the surrounding land, a laurel or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> can actually
be found there, too) is named <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Boggy Hole Road</ENAMEX>,
an apt name till <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> or so, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of
Old Lyme rebuilt it, widened it, paved it, and provided
it with drainage; it is now in such good condition
that I have suggested that the name be changed
to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boggy Hole Boulevard</ENAMEX>, an idea that has not found
much favor at the town hall.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boggy Hole Road</ENAMEX> it will
probably remain, even though the name is proving
expensive to maintain owing to the frequency with
which its (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>) identifying sign is filched by
onomophilic souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX>.

            The Names of Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tribes</ENAMEX>



            The names <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> gave themselves are not always
known, sometimes because both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX> and language
are extinct, attested to only by the name assigned
to them by others.  Some names ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beaver</ENAMEX>,
Blackfoot, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Crow, Dog-Rib, Hare</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone</ENAMEX> ) are English
translations of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> ones.  Others have entered
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bois Br√ªl√©</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coeur d'Al√™ne</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gros Ventre, Huron, Loucheux, Nez Perc√©</ENAMEX>, Pend

Orej√≥n, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seminole</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tonto</ENAMEX>) .  Still others were given by
neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> and, sometimes, even when the
literal sense is known the connotations are unclear:
for example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dakota</ENAMEX> name for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayuhwa</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sleepy Ones</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackfoot</ENAMEX> name for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kainah</ENAMEX> , a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division of the Blackfoot</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ah-kai-nah</ENAMEX>) Many
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiefs</ENAMEX>.  Can we be sure no insult, no irony was intended?

            Some names seem to have been caught in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX>'s question: Who are you?  I am
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human being</ENAMEX>, or, We are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who live here.  Hence, perhaps, come the

answers describing their being distinctly different
from neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clallam</ENAMEX> said they
were strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caddo</ENAMEX> called themselves
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">k√§doh√§d√</ENAMEX>§cho real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kiowa</ENAMEX> , at least to
themselves, were k√¢-i-gw≈≠ the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> or principal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iroquois</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superior men</ENAMEX>.  By contrast,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hopi</ENAMEX> said, We are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hopituh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of
peace.  Was it after the same fashion that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cahita</ENAMEX> answered?  Or was their name, which means
nothing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cahita</ENAMEX>, the answer to a quite different
question?

            The question, Who are those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>?  must
often have been asked--and answered.  The Choctaw
said, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apalachi</ENAMEX> helpers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackfoot</ENAMEX>, Atsina
Good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nootka</ENAMEX>, also, inadvertently
named the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wakash</ENAMEX>, saying, ‚ÄúGood = waukash good
just as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheepscot</ENAMEX> named the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wannoak</ENAMEX> by saying
they were nopesawenoak <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">warriors</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pomo</ENAMEX> said of
their southwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cousins</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kashaya</ENAMEX>, that they
were kashaya nimble, quick, by way of praise,
blame, or mere description.

            Often a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX>'s fear or fearful experience is revealed
in a name: [The name following > is that
yielded by the italicized word.]

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Strangers</ENAMEX> were not only likely to be hostile,
they also spoke strangely.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malecite</ENAMEX> or Maliseet
were maliseet broken talkers to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micmac</ENAMEX> and
talkers of gibberish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abnaki</ENAMEX>.  To the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dakota</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cheyenne</ENAMEX> were shaiyena <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of unintelligible
speech; to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Creek</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cherokee</ENAMEX>
were tciloki <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of a different speech; and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tul'bush</ENAMEX>, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wailaki</ENAMEX>, were babblers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tul'bush.</ENAMEX>
            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wabanaki</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lenni Lenape</ENAMEX>) called the
Mohicans <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">amahiganiak wolves</ENAMEX>, referring either to
their predatory habits or (less probably) to their totemic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dakota</ENAMEX> name for the Absaroka
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bird</ENAMEX>- or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crow</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> seems to have done.

            Many names point to the appearance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX>,

            There are names with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> possible
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etymology</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arapaho</ENAMEX> called themselves `trader
(s) arapaho; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crow</ENAMEX> called them aa-raxp√©-ahu
having much skin (i.e., tattooed), and it is the
Crow word that has found its way into the etymological
information in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s Third New International
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> .  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Micmac</ENAMEX> called themselves
megumawaach perfect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and migmac <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>; the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maliseet</ENAMEX> called them micmac porcupine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and
mi k'am in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maliseet</ENAMEX> meant both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micmac</ENAMEX> and
wood spirit.  In various <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Algonquian</ENAMEX> languages, the
Ojibwa were the greatest ( ochibe, ochippe,
ochipwe, ojibwa, otchipwe) but ojib-ubway mocassins
with a puckered seam (a style characteristic of
Ojibwa footwear), literally, to roast till puckered
up is the origin cited in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s.
            

            No etymology is provided for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Papago</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pima</ENAMEX>;
both might be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hopi</ENAMEX> for, respectively, mark on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">forehead</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">reed grass</ENAMEX>, plausible origins since all
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> have inhabited parts of what is now
known as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>.

            A few names are neither <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> translations
nor mispronounciations and approximations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
words.  Flat-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> , for example, refers to several
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tribes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catawba, Chinook, Choctaw, Waxshaw</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>) that once practised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>-flattening; and the
Yellowknife , an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Algonquian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living east of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Slave Lake</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, were so named from their
use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> implements: pedestrian names, these,
in which inventiveness played no part.  But, for that
matter, it seems that inventiveness never has played
a part in producing the names of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>.  Their multiplicity
merely reflects the rich diversity of those
who have inhabited <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> since before the
arrival of the white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> --whenever that might
have been.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Katie Bar the Door</ENAMEX>
            

            This old exclamation, probably dating centuries
back, had a sudden vogue in the late eighties and
early nineties when the sports fraternity latched on
to it and spread it everywhere through radio and
television.  The best translation I have heard is,
Watch out!  Hell's about to break loose!  It will suit
a lot of occasions, domestic, political, military and of
course those critical moments in sports.  It means
threat and tension; beyond that nobody seems to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>.  Katie, bar the door!  But where does it come
from?  Like many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">long-ago</TIMEX> happenings, nobody
thought to make a permanent record.  Those who
knew the story--in this case a heroic one--had no
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to keep it in memory except by folk tales and
songs.  But these may not get written down, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tellers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singers</ENAMEX> may have no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successors</ENAMEX>.  So, great
deeds of the past are ultimately forgotten, the remnants
distorted or no longer understood.  Who was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Katie</ENAMEX>?  When, why, how did she bar the door?  The
following tale is pieced together from obscure and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scanty</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, with some logical surmise.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King James</ENAMEX> I of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>, a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who
drew a number of chieftains together under him,
strengthening the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX>,  naturally aroused rivalry
and enmity, which led at last to his assassination
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1437</TIMEX>.  This was accomplished in an outbuilding
to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King</ENAMEX> had retired with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> for recreation.  The assassination had been
carefully planned: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> had been removed from
the door, and when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">murderers</ENAMEX> attacked, it could
not be found.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>, by legend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katherine Douglas</ENAMEX>, thrust her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> through the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staples</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> should have been, and temporarily
kept the door shut.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> took refuge in a
lower <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, but ironically, the outer door had been
recently sealed by his order.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> was
broken, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">murderers</ENAMEX> rushed in; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> defended
himself but was outnumbered and killed.  But the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lady</ENAMEX>'s heroic deed was told and sung: she became
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate Barlass</ENAMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lass</ENAMEX> who barred the door.  That
is the legend, but I have found no written record of
the song nor anyone who can sing it.  Katie bar the
door must have been a refrain or a line of verse.
We may guess that as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> realized
they were under attack, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> looked to their
swords, and one of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> shouted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katie</ENAMEX>,
who finding that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> was not there, did the best
she could think to do.  A noble <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> and a noble
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deed</ENAMEX>.  And the shout became a dire warning of imminent
danger.

            The last part of the tale?  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Katie</ENAMEX> and her story
must surely have been brought to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and sung
in some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Appalachia</ENAMEX>,
made mostly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>.  Many of these old
ballads have survived to the present; this one, as we
put it together, must at least have made current the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">warning Katie</ENAMEX>, bar the door!  And out of the hills
some hill-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> coming north introduced it
there, perhaps directly into the world of sports and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sportscasting</ENAMEX>.  But nobody has written down the
facts, or if written, they lie hidden in obscure places.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> of language, lexicographers, need records
too.  Is it now too late to track our surmises
back to facts, to recover the missing pieces of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Katie</ENAMEX>'s
story?  The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of American Regional English</ENAMEX>
is now editing the letter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K. Lady Katherine</ENAMEX> deserves
to be honored in memory once again, as all good
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> agree.
