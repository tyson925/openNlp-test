            Nothing underscores the subtle complexities of
language more strikingly than the miscommunications
that occur among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew members</ENAMEX>,
and air traffic controllers.  An experienced flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX>
reports noticing considerable power on, just
before touching down, while checking out a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> in a
small airplane.  He had thought he was saying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Back‚</ENAMEX>Äî
on the power , with a stress on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Back</ENAMEX> and a pause before
on , but he was interpreted by the pilot as having said
Back on‚Äîthe power , with the stress on on and the
pause after it.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> who had been instructed to
maintain <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7000 feet</NUMEX> and who was then told,


traffic at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten o'clock</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three miles</NUMEX>,
level at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX>, to pass under you,

            

            responded, We have him , and was then challenged
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> when he was observed descending
through <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6800 feet</NUMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> had misconstrued the
phrase level at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> imperatively, as an instruction
for himself, meaning [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Descend</ENAMEX> to and remain] level
at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX>, rather than understanding it declaratively,
as it had been intended, as an assertion about his
traffic, meaning [The traffic is] level at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX>.  On
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 25, 1990</TIMEX>, an aircraft over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cove Neck</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX>, ran out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">159</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
aboard died in the resulting crash, including the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> crew <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in the cockpit.  The flying pilot
had instructed the copilot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digale</ENAMEX> que estamos en
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emergencia</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">copilot</ENAMEX> had responded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX>, senor,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ya le</ENAMEX> dije ; but what he had actually radioed to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">controller</ENAMEX> was We're running out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> .  The specific
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word emergency is required in the aviation
protocol to convey to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> that the
disaster is imminent, but the copilot failed to use
that word, even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> had used its exact
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> equivalent in telling him what to say.

            As I show in my book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fatal Words: Communication</ENAMEX>
Clashes and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aircraft Crashes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago</ENAMEX>
Press, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>), these examples are representative
of a wide range of accidents and near misses in
which language misunderstandings or omissions
have played a contributing and sometimes central
role.  An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> reports responding to the tower
calling traffic by saying I got it , with the intended
meaning I see the traffic but being interpreted by
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> as meaning that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> was now
flying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>.  In similar incident, a copilot reports
that the landing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> was in sight by saying I've
got it , with the result that the flying pilot let go of
the controls.  The sentence Maintain runway heading
is interpreted sometimes as meaning that the pilot
maintain the heading indicated when lined up on the
extended center line of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">runway</ENAMEX> and sometimes
as meaning that the pilot take a heading after liftoff
to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> traveling on that line.  In some
situations this difference can lead to a conflict between
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aircraft</ENAMEX> in a cross wind after takeoff.  At an
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">airport</ENAMEX> at which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Local Control</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ground Control</ENAMEX>
were combined, a construction <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">B1</TIMEX>, called,
At the localizer road to proceed to the ramp .  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX>,
knowing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B1</ENAMEX> had called but not sure
what the request had been, replied <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">B1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ground</ENAMEX>, Go
Ahead and then proceeded to talk to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> while
waiting for a reply.  B1 misinterpreted the phrase
Go Ahead as referring to his driving, rather than his
speaking, and was halfway down his normal route of
travel before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> realized what had happened.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homophony</ENAMEX> and, more commonly, near-homophony,
in which different words or phrases
sound exactly or nearly alike, can be just as problematic
as syntactic ambiguity.  For example, the
sentence Pass to the left of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> is ambiguous
because left can mean either the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>'s left or the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hearer</ENAMEX>'s left; but further confusion is also possible,
because left can sound very much like west .  A pilot
reports practicing short field landings in a small airplane
as a student when his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last</TIMEX> of
the power , meaning to reduce to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> while flaring.
However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> thought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> had said
Blast of power , fearing an imminent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stall</ENAMEX>.  The result
was confusion and a longer landing.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> who was
observed on radar to be somewhat higher than
called for and flying in the wrong direction turned
out to have misheard a clearance for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maspeth</ENAMEX> climb
as a clearance for a massive climb .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maspeth</ENAMEX> is a fix in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> metropolitan area, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> was
unfamiliar with the local geography.  An outbound
pilot who was told to receive his clearance from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> when he was on the deck misheard this as off
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">deck</ENAMEX> and proceeded with his takeoff, consequently
finding himself head-on with an inbound <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>.
In another incident, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> widebody airplane
barely missed colliding with another after landing,
because the pilot heard Hold short as Oh sure in response
to his asking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> May we cross ? in
reference to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">runway</ENAMEX>.

            An international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> inbound to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> was handed off to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> after the captain
had read back the clearance Cleared to descend
to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two zero zero</NUMEX>, cross <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two zero miles</NUMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XYZ</ENAMEX> at
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two two zero</NUMEX> and the First <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officer</ENAMEX> had set the altitude
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">selector</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20,000 feet</NUMEX>.  To the initial contact
from the flight, Leaving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two two zero</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two zero</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">zero</ENAMEX> , the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> responded, Were you cleared
to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two zero zero</NUMEX> ?  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> claimed later that the
clearance had been only to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">220</NUMEX>, that is, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22,000 feet</NUMEX>,
but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> had understood otherwise.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Captain</ENAMEX>
who was flying with an assigned altitude of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>
feet while being vectored for a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">landing</ENAMEX> on runway
27L thought he heard the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">copilot</ENAMEX> say Cleared to
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>, took this to mean Cleared to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seven thousand</NUMEX>
feet, and started to descend.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">copilot</ENAMEX> had really
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cleared</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two seven</NUMEX> in reference to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">runway</ENAMEX>.
Confusions between the identical sounding to and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> almost led to a mid-air collision, when a pilot
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">misheard Climb</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five zero</NUMEX> as Climb <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two five zero</NUMEX>,
putting him on a collision course with another aircraft
that was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just fifteen hundred feet</NUMEX> above him; it
did lead to a fatal accident, when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>, in another
incident, read back the instruction Descend <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero zero</NUMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.K. Four</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero zero</NUMEX> and then proceeded,
without correction from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX>, to descend
to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four hundred</NUMEX>, rather than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four hundred</NUMEX>
feet.

            To is not the only preposition that can kill.  On
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 27, 1977</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">747</NUMEX> radioed We
are now at take-off, as his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> began rolling down
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">runway</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tenerife</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX>.  The air
traffic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> mistakenly took this statement to
mean that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> was at the take-off point, waiting
for further instructions, and so did not warn the pilot
that another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">747</NUMEX> that was invisible in
the thick fog, was already on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">runway</ENAMEX>.  The resulting
crash killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">583</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in what is still the most
destructive accident in aviation history.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX>
pilot's otherwise perplexing use of the very nonstandard
phrase at take-off, rather than the more standard
phrase taking off, appears to have been a subtle
form of what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguists</ENAMEX> call code-switching, a process in
which bilingual or multilingual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> inadvertently
switch back and forth from one of their languages
to another in the course of a conversation.  In
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>'s case, what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguists</ENAMEX> call the present
progressive aspect, which is expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> by a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">verb</ENAMEX>'s -ing form, can be expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> by the
equivalent of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at</NUMEX> plus the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">verb</ENAMEX>'s infinitive.  Perhaps
because of fatigue or the stress of having to work in
conditions of no visibility, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>-speaking pilot
switched into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> grammatical construction
while keeping his words in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, as required.  The
Spanish-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> had no clue that this was
going on and so interpreted the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at</TIMEX> in the most natural
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>, as indicating a place, the take-off point.

            Code-switching can take place even within the
same language, when different dialects or variants
are available.  On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 17, 1981</TIMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Wayne</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Orange County Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Ana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cal 336</ENAMEX> was cleared to land while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Cal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">931</ENAMEX> was
cleared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> into position for takeoff, but the controller
then decided that more time was needed between
the takeoff and the landing and so told <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">336</NUMEX> to
go around.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">336 Captain</ENAMEX> resisted this instruction
by having his copilot radio to ask for permission to
continue landing, but he switched from technical
aviation jargon to ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> and used the
word hold to express this request.  In aviation parlance,
to hold some action always means to stop
what you are doing and thus to go around in a landing
situation; but in ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> hold can also
mean to continue what you are doing and thus to
land in such a situation.  The resulting confusion
led to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> injuries, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of them classified as serious,
and the complete destruction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> by fire,
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Cal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">336</ENAMEX> landed with its landing gear retracted,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Captain</ENAMEX> having finally decided to follow
instructions to go around, but too late to do so.

            There are technological means of ameliorating
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">miscommunications</ENAMEX> in the aviation setting, as I discuss
in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fatal Words</ENAMEX>, but there are broader lessons to
be learned from these examples.  Not only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">controllers</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in general need to learn to
be more mindful of their own language use and to be
willing to use more words to get meanings across.
We all need to learn to listen with more care and to
ask for clarification, rather than assuming that we
already know what is going to be said to us in advance.

            What Is <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Dementia</ENAMEX>?




            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dementia</ENAMEX> is a term often used by laypersons and
by medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, both of which have
employed the word in different ways at various
times.  The resulting confusion is furthered by inconsistencies
among definitions in medical dictionaries
and textbooks.  A survey of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> material was
therefore undertaken to provide a history of the
word and of how its use has evolved.

            
               Dementia derives from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, de - away or
from, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ment-</ENAMEX> , root of mens `mind.'  The OED incorrectly
attributes the initial use of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe Pinel</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1806</TIMEX>: the word was first used in an
English text in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1592</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Cosin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Member</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX>, in defense of the hanging of a conspirator
against the monarchy.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cosin</ENAMEX> defined dementia as
...a passion of the minde, bereaving it of the
light of understanding...  The word <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appeared
in an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> medical dictionary in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1775</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Motherby</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A New Medical Dictionary</ENAMEX> ) said it
was madness, or a delirium and used the same
definition for insania .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dementia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insanity</ENAMEX> , and madness
were synonyms throughout most of the 19th
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robley Dunglison</ENAMEX> in his series of medical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionaries</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1833‚Äî1903</ENAMEX>) echoes medical thinking
of the time when he says of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX> in common
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parlance</ENAMEX>, and even in legal language, this word is
synonymous with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insanity</ENAMEX>... It is characterized by
a total loss of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> of thought.  Medical use of
madness then disappeared, but the word was retained
by the laity.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1900s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insanity</ENAMEX> also faded
from the medical vocabulary, and it is now used by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> when deciding on responsibility
for acts committed while mentally deranged: not
guilty by reason of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insanity</ENAMEX>.

            Modern understanding of the meaning of dementia
began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1892</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Dictionary of Psychological</ENAMEX>
Medicine , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Tuke</ENAMEX>, where it was defined
as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in which manifestations of mind are
to a greater or less degree absent in consequence of
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> or decay of the brain itself.  It is always an
acquired condition, and as such is to be distinguished
from amentia, which is either a congenital
state or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> closely connected with that period.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuke</ENAMEX>'s definition has a remarkably contemporary
sound.  It recognizes degrees of the syndrome rather
than the previously described total loss of mentality.
The condition is attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> or decay of
the brain and is acquired.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuke</ENAMEX> also commented on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reversibility</ENAMEX> and dismissed acute dementia as really
instances of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melancholia</ENAMEX> cum stupore .  In the late
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th century</TIMEX> he listed nineteen forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX>,
from acute and accidentalis to senile and toxica .

            The meaning of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX> frequently changed in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>; the word lost popularity in the
1940s and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">'50s</TIMEX>.  Selected definitions from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dorland</ENAMEX>'s
Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX> illustrate some of the shifts:


<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9th ed.: Insanity</ENAMEX> characterized by loss or
impairment of intellect, will, and memory.

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">19th ed</ENAMEX>.: A generic designation for mental
deterioration, less frequently used than formerly,
except in the term dementia praecox.

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1957</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">23rd ed</ENAMEX>.: A general designation for mental
deterioration.

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">25th ed</ENAMEX>.: A generic designation for mental
deterioration; called also aphrenia, aphronesia,
and athymia.

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">26th ed</ENAMEX>.: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organic</ENAMEX> loss of intellectual function,
called also aphrenia, aphronesia, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">athymia</ENAMEX>.

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">27th ed</ENAMEX>.: [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSM</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">III</ENAMEX>] An organic mental disorder
characterized by a general loss of intellectual
abilities involving impairment of memory,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">judgment</ENAMEX>, and abstract thinking as well as
changes in personality.  It does not include loss
of intellectual functioning caused by clouding
of consciousness... nor that caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>...
Dementia may be caused by a number
of conditions, some reversible, some progressive...

            

            Each definition has deficiencies.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX>)
is difficult to determine, and was soon abandoned.  If
dementia means only mental deterioration (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941</TIMEX>
to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>), it is not separated from neuroses and psychoses.
The word organic (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>) addresses this
problem.  The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synonyms</ENAMEX> cited in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX> and repeated
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX> came from a lexicographer whose
mind was fixed in an earlier (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19th</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>.  The
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> quotation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagnostic and Statistical</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manual</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSM-III</ENAMEX>) returned <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dorland's Medical Dictionary</ENAMEX>
to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th century</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSM</ENAMEX>-III is the standard
psychiatric manual defining mental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX>.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s and '50s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX> was seldom
used except for types of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>, e.g., dementia
praecox , or catatonic and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">paranoid dementia</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Psychiatrists</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that time</TIMEX> officially replaced the
word dementia with chronic brain <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> , a useless
phrase now almost completely abandoned.

            Let us examine critically some representative
definitions of the word dementia to illustrate the
complex nature of the term and to marvel at the diversity
of words used to define this single concept:


Lishman, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organic Psychiatry</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>: An acquired
global impairment of intellect, reason and personality
but without impairment of consciousness.

            

            
               Global , meaning all aspects of intellect, is used
by many medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>, but is incorrect.  The decay
is not global at onset; discrete disorders of mention
may dominate the clinical picture in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">midcourse</TIMEX>; and
even in the final stages cognitive impairment may be
selective.  Maintained consciousness is accepted by
modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> as necessary to the definition, but
nothing is said here of the cerebral origin of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX>,
its organic nature, or its degree of permanence.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Butterworths Medical Dictionary</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>: A form of
mental disorder in which the cognitive and intellectual
functions of the mind are prominently
or predominantly affected; invariably a
symptom of organic cerebral <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, and as a
rule, impairment of memory is one of the earliest
symptoms.  Dementia necessarily implies
some degree of permanent change; totally recoverable
confusional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> in which cognitive
changes are prominent are thus excluded.

            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cognitive</ENAMEX> and intellectual are synonyms for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> of knowing ( OED ): use of both words is redundant.
Of the mind is unnecessary‚Äîwhere else is
knowing located?  Impairment of memory is a frequent
early symptom of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's</ENAMEX> dementia, but
not necessarily of other types.  The concept of irreversibility
arose from initially equating all dementias
with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">senile dementia</ENAMEX>.  Toxic and infectious dementias
can be halted or reversed, as illustrated by the
effect of penicillin on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia paralytica</ENAMEX> , the cerebral
form of neurosyphilis.  It is therefore incorrect
to state that some degree of permanent change is
implied for all types of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">III</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>),
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>: The essential feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Dementia</ENAMEX> is impairment
in short-and long-term memory, associated
with impairment in abstract thinking, impaired
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">judgment</ENAMEX>, other disburbances of higher
cortical function, or personality changes.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disturbance</ENAMEX> is severe enough to interfere significantly
with work or usual social activities or
relationships with others.  The diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dementia</ENAMEX>
is not made if these symptoms occur
only in the presence of reduced ability to maintain
or shift attention to external stimuli, as in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delirium</ENAMEX>; however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delirium and Dementia</ENAMEX>
may coexist... an underlying causative organic
factor is always assumed... Dementia
may be progressive, static, or remitting...

            

            Emphasis on memory loss does not take into account
dementias other than <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's</ENAMEX>.  Insistence
on severity eliminates mild cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX> or instances
where a mildly demented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is able to
manage when little intellectual ability is needed.  All
mental and physical disorders may interfere with
work or usual social activities, hence these losses
are not diagnostic of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX>.  The assumption that
a causative organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> is always present is not
proved in rare cases.  Complete studies including autopsy
may occasionally fail to disclose the cause.

            The definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX> has changed often
since it was used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Cosin</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1592</TIMEX>, and it
will continue to change as new information becomes
available.  Any definition, therefore, must be tentative,
but it should not contain outmoded concepts,
as occurs too often in medical dictionaries.  Current
meaning may be sought in articles published in recent
medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> are contentious,
and judgment must be used.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dementia</ENAMEX> is not a single symptom but a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>,
a group of symptoms and signs that occur in
different combinations depending on the site and
nature of changes in brain tissue.  It therefore cannot
be properly defined in a few words.  A synthesis
of current uses of the word would include the following
concepts: an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired syndrome</ENAMEX> of mental
deterioration without loss of consciousness; onset
often uncertain; early changes from normal to abnormal
frequently imperceptible.  Furthermore, dementia
is chronic and usually progressive, but it may
be static or reversible.  It arises secondary to structural
or biochemical alterations of the brain, hence
its medical description is organic.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dementia</ENAMEX> is characterized
by changes in personality and behavior
with disturbances of orientation, memory, abstract
thinking, and judgment.  Altered cerebral function
may also result in disordered language and difficulty
in movements requiring dexterity.

            It should be noted that individual symptoms
may occur in normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> at various times and
that memory commonly declines in normal old age.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Popular</ENAMEX> and medical use of dementia first associated
it with senility but since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> has linked it
predominantly with the type <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> described by Alois
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1907</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's</ENAMEX> and multi-infarct
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dementia</ENAMEX>, the result of multiple small strokes, are
currently considered the most frequent causes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX>.
The devastating and untreatable effects of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">senility</ENAMEX> and of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of dementia excite
horror and pity.  Other causes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX>, however,
although less common, can be treated effectively
and reversed.  These conditions include thyroid
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX>, mercury poisoning, infectious
diseases such as neurosyphilis and meningitis, nutritional
disorders, including pellagra and pernicious
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX> that involve deficiency of elements of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitamin</ENAMEX> B complex, and chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX>.  Unfortunately,
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> is a recent addition to the list of
causes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX> that lack an effective treatment.
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">True Meaning of Christmas</ENAMEX>




            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mistletoe</ENAMEX> and festivities, holly and ivy, peace to
the world, commerciality... Just what is
the meaning of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>?  This is a question asked
all too often <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>.  A little research soon
reveals the true meaning of the season of good will
to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.

            The word <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> derives from the late old
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Christes</ENAMEX> m√¶sse , meaning the mass of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX>.  That is easy enough to follow, but digging a
little deeper into the meaning of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> leads us
to a strange anomaly.  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass</ENAMEX> has its roots, as already
noted, in the old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> m√¶sse which itself derives
from the written <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> missa which means send,
send away, or dismiss.  The earliest occurrences of
the word being used to refer to a religious service
are to be found in the epistles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Ambrose</ENAMEX> and
the itinerary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silvia of Aquitania</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last quarter</TIMEX>
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX>, when it was applied to matins
and vespers; however, in its most eminent sense,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m√¶sse</ENAMEX> was used to denote the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eucharist</ENAMEX>.

            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">etymologists</ENAMEX> believe that missa at first denoted
the solemn conclusion of a religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>,
the words <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ite</ENAMEX>, missa est Go, it is the dismissal being
uttered at the end of the ceremony but later applied
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> itself.  And it is here that the anomaly
can be seen; in its most rudimentary form, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">means Christ</ENAMEX>'s dismissal, quite the opposite of its
meaning of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX>'s birth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.

            The angel may well have sung <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The First Noel</ENAMEX> ,
but what exactly is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">No√´l</ENAMEX>?  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">No√´l</ENAMEX> originally was a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">canticle</ENAMEX> or song sung at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> time in country
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">churches</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, but it soon became a general
term for a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Christmas carol</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nowel</ENAMEX> is closely related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">No√´l</ENAMEX> , although there is a
slight difference in meaning: nowel was a word
shouted or sung as an expression of joy to commemorate
the birth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX>.  Both words derive from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> nƒÅtƒÅlis birth.

            Another term used to describe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yule</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yule</ENAMEX> has its roots in both Christianity and paganism.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old English</ENAMEX> the word \?\e√≥l was used to
mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas Day</TIMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christmastide</ENAMEX>.  It corresponds
to the old Norse j√≥l which was a heathen festival
lasting twelve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>.
It was this festival that was adopted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>
and later became known as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>, hence
the twelve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of celebration around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christmas</ENAMEX>
period.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> is known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Festive Season</ENAMEX>.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> when we remember the poor and needy
by spending wallets full of money and gorging ourselves
on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sage</ENAMEX> and onion stuffing, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christmas</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pudding</ENAMEX>.  Indeed, the word festive comes from
the word feast which derives from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> festa
which was a feastal ceremony.  Festa itself derives
from festus which probably, according to etymologists,
had the same root as feria fair.

            Such is the true meaning of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> .  It is exactly
the same as it means to us now: twelve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of
ceremonial feasting.  Maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> has always
been the most commercial time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, and it is just
our perception of it that has changed.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Reading Non-Sequentially: The Peculiar Kanbun System</ENAMEX>




            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> languages are written from left to
right, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> from right to left,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> may be written vertically, and
Ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> was written multidirectionally.
The word boustrophedon is used to describe inscriptions
that run as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ox ploughs</ENAMEX> (left to right, then
right to left, and back again).  Despite the wide
range of directional options, all writing systems have
one thing in common: they are intended to be read
in the direction they are written.  Actually, there is
one significant exception to this rule, a written language
used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> called kanbun .

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kanbun</ENAMEX> \?\ \?\ is essentially <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Classical Chinese</ENAMEX>
( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">w√©ny√°nw√©n</ENAMEX> \?\ \?\ \?\ ) as read by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>.
It began as a decoding system in which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> learned to read texts from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> as though
they were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, and developed into a way of
writing employed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> themselves.

            In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kanbun</ENAMEX> system, special punctuation enables
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> to convert phrases presented in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> order (usually subject-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">verb</NUMEX>-object) to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
order (usually subject-object-verb), and to
supply missing inflectional endings to produce
something approximating <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Classical Japanese</ENAMEX>.  For example,
let us consider the phrase:


             <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mandarin    English</ENAMEX> translation
\?\   sh√†o    young
\?\   ni√°n    year
\?\   y√¨      easy
\?\   lƒÉo     old
\?\   xu√©     study
\?\   n√°n     difficult
\?\   ch√©ng   accomplish

            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mandarin Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>
would read this from top to bottom (it may also be
written left to right) as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sh√†oni√°n y√¨ lƒÉo</ENAMEX>, xu√© n√°n
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ch√©ng</ENAMEX> , and understand it to mean something like
It is easy for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> to grow old, but harder to
complete one's studies.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speakers</ENAMEX> of other dialects
would pronounce the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> differently but
would associate the same meaning with the sentence.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mandarin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chengdu</ENAMEX> would
say sƒÉoni√°n y\?\ n√†o, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">x√º√≥ n√°n c√©n</ENAMEX> , while a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Min speaker</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amoy</ENAMEX> would say si√†oli√¢n \?\ l√≥, h√°k
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">l√¢n s√™ng</ENAMEX> .

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>, educated in Kanbun
would punctuate this sentence with the aid of the
symbol:


           <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> pronunciation
\?\   sh≈ç
\?\   nen
\?\   yasu(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ku</ENAMEX>)
\?\
\?\   o(i)
\?\   gaku
\?\   gata(shi)
\?\
\?\   na(ri)

            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> indicates that the character above it is
to be read after the following character.  Parentheses
indicate inflectional endings not found in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, inferred
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>.  The text would thus
be read sh≈çnen o(i) yasu(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ku</ENAMEX>), gaku na(ri) gata(shi) ,
which retains the meaning of the original, as much as
any translation can.

            Note that some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> readings are
very similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> original: sh≈ç, nen , and
gaku are etymologically related to sh√†o, ni√°n and xu√©
(originally gak ).  On the other hand, the readings
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX>(i), yasu(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ku</ENAMEX>), na(ri) and gata(shi) , are unrelated
to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lƒÉo</ENAMEX>, y√¨, ch√©ng , and n√°n .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Characters</ENAMEX> are
either pronounced in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanized</ENAMEX> version of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> ( on reading), or else a synonymous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
word ( kun reading) is read in place of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
word.  The choice of which reading to use for a specific
character is determined by context.

            Sometimes, for additional clarity, kanbun <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>
will add the inflectional endings to the right of
the line, using phonetic symbols called katakana :


\?\   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sh≈</ENAMEX>ç
\?\   nen
\?\   yasu
\?\   \?\
\?\
\?\
\?\   gaku
\?\   gata
\?\   \?\
\?\

            

            Of course, to get from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
word order, a simple transposition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> characters
may not suffice.  More complex reordering may be
indicated through punctuation as well.  A sequence
of \?\ signs means that the text so marked is read in
reverse order:


\?\   1
\?\   5
\?\           [Circles represent any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>,
\?\   4       and numbers indicate
\?\   <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>       the order in which they are to
              be read.]
\?\   2

            

            In addition to the symbol, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other
devices for indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> are to be read
out of sequence.  First, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> - ichi , one
and= ni , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> may be used:


\?\   1
\?\   4
\?\   2
\?\   3
\?\

            

            Note that these numbers may be used more than
once in a long phrase:  


\?\   1
\?\   2
\?\       [The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> occurence of = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fol</NUMEX>-
          lows the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> occurence of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-,</ENAMEX>
\?\   3   etc.  That is, the application of
\?\   <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>   the reversals must be consecu-
\?\   <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>   tive, without overlapping or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nesting</ENAMEX>.]
\?\   6
\?\   7

            

            In cases where reversals overlap, or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nest</ENAMEX>, a second
pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> is used, namely, \?\ ue , up
and \?\ shita , down.  Here are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> examples:


\?\  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7      \</TIMEX>?\   8
\?\  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1      \</TIMEX>?\   3
\?\  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4      \</TIMEX>?\   1
\?\  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2      \</TIMEX>?\   2
\?\  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3      \</TIMEX>?\   6
\?\  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5      \</TIMEX>?\   4
\?\  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6      \</TIMEX>?\   5
\?\  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8      \</TIMEX>?\   7

            

            In general, the reordering markers are easily understood;
the main source of ambiguity relates to the
choice of on or kun readings, and, if a kun reading has
been selected, the choice of inflectional endings intended.
Not surprisingly, this arcane system of reading
contrary to written order takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> to learn and
has fallen out of fashion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent decades</TIMEX>.  While
there are still many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who can read kanbun
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">texts</ENAMEX>, very few can actually write them.  In the nineteenth
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, however, kanbun was still widely
used, and it is interesting to note that some of the first
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> language instruction books written in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>
employ similar systems for reading <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and
other languages in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>!
         
         
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balance of Trade</ENAMEX>




            I was amused and bemused by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martyn Ecott</ENAMEX>'s The
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Franglais Blues</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XX</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>].  My bemusement led to
my wondering how many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> words in the story
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youpie</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc</ENAMEX>, where the vocabulary has been selected
to illustrate the relentless incursion of English
expressions into modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, were borrowed
into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, either the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern</ENAMEX> language.  Here is a copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martyn</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ecott</ENAMEX>'s little story, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franglais</ENAMEX> expressions
left in italics but with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> morphemes
originally borrowed from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> underlined in the
mainly English text.  My etymological authority is
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Dictionary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX> .


A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine, let's call him <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc</ENAMEX>, was finishing
his work for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>.  He consulted his
agenda diary, appointment book to check
whether he was keeping to his planning schedule.
His listing computer printout list helps him
keep track of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> and is used by his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> for un mailing despatch of letters; mail

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">raining</ENAMEX> so he had to avoid un aquaplaning skid
on the slippery surface.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc</ENAMEX> is a bit of a youpie
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">yuppie</ENAMEX> and has to ensure he is keeping his
standing social status.  He has his own box private
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">garage</ENAMEX>.  His <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, too, is standing conferring
status, as is his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> who regularly has her
lifting face-lift to make sure she is sufficiently

to be snob√©e looked down upon.  He himself

In the meantime, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> pops along to the local

gets her exercise down at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">le</ENAMEX> fitness gym.  She
also wears baskets, but with un body stretch fluo

            In this calculatedly selective text I count only a
few more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franglais</ENAMEX> words or morphemes, forty-four,
than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> morphemes originally, in most cases
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries ago</TIMEX>, borrowed from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, forty by my
count.  However, of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> words in the closing
paragraph of the article, where the language is not
artificially loaded, I find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> words derived from
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acad√©mie</ENAMEX> , which is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, but
not a single word of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franglais</ENAMEX>, nor would any Franglais
expression appear in the paragraph were it
translated into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.  The current balance of trade
may be in favor of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, but overall it is clearly
still heavily in favor of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.

            As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martyn Ecott</ENAMEX> cleverly demonstrates, francophone
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purists</ENAMEX> have reason for alarm; the flow, absolute
flood of vocabulary from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>,
once resulting in a kind of hybridization, has lately
been somewhat reversed, depositing in the elegant
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> language such grotesque neologisms as un
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pin</ENAMEX>'s or hip hop.  Certainly, though, most of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">freaks</ENAMEX> will be dislodged and swept away by the passage
of time while those already rooted in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> language, like smoking and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>-end, have
become naturalized and no longer jar in the Gallic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ear</ENAMEX>.  The real threat to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> language is not
that some faddish expressions and technical terms
are invading <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.  No, the real menace, already
almost a fait accompli, is that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> will replace
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> altogether in science and technology, commerce,
and international communication.  At the
present rate, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, which still appears along with
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in my <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> passport and which sometimes
still fills full-page ads in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX>, may
wind up like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greek‚</ENAMEX>Äîa language providing access to
the roots of world culture but hardly worth learning
for the conduct of mundane affairs.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Guide</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard American English</ENAMEX>
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Connecticut</ENAMEX>, recently called this book
to my attention, and I am pleased that he did, for it
gives advice on a number of issues‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Äî6500</NUMEX>, according
to the jacket blurb‚Äîthat is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stalwart</ENAMEX>, which is to
say, advice with which I agree.

            Before getting into that, I feel compelled to reiterate
my perpetual complaint about the prospective
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of such books: in order to look something up in
a reference book of any kind‚Äîdictionary, thesaurus,
usage book, encyclopedia‚Äîa <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> must either
acknowledge that he does not know something
or, at least, have doubts about the information he
already possesses.  Not everyone can always be sure
of everything, but it has always seemed to me that
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the functions of education is to implant doubt
in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>'s mind: in other words, it is not so important
that he remember, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> after leaving
school, what a dangling modifier, split infinitive,
agreement between the number of a subject and its
verb, etc., might mean, but the process of education
should have created a (minor) circuit in the brain of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupil</ENAMEX> so that when a certain situation is encountered
later on, he acknowledge a nagging suspicion
that there might be something wrong and that it
would be best were he to look it up in an authoritative
source to see what is written there by people
who know such things.  Had the semi-educated computer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> who gave us programmed, programming,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">programmer labored</ENAMEX> under any doubt
about their ability to spell according to standard
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> practice, they might have looked it up in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX> or other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> and got it right.

            The proliferation of printed media and the
amount of text appearing on television screens these
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> requires a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>; the problem is that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> is these days construed in its minimalist sense
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who is literate: that is, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who
knows how to write but by no means necessarily a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who knows how to write .  As the standards
slip in the marketplace, so they move on down the
slippery slope in the education place, with older,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wiser</ENAMEX>, more dedicated, better educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>
gradually but ineluctably replaced by those who
have not a scintilla of enlightenment regarding the
meaning of contrary-to-fact condition, comma splice ,
or double genitive .  The result is that quality and art
of expression continue to deteriorate, and we are
left with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> who spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five or ten minutes</TIMEX>
to deliver a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three-minute</TIMEX> weather report on
television, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housewives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">househusbands</ENAMEX> who delight
in revealing intimate, revolting, and highly suspect
details of their childhood on national television,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> devoted entirely to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">charlatans</ENAMEX> perpetrating
psychic rubbish.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth G. Wilson</ENAMEX> is clearly of the old school
(or, to make him seem younger, I should write
older <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>).  His advice, couched in language
that reflects the tolerance of one who has spent
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> correcting <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> themes, flows from an enviable
intimacy with, confidence in, and control of the
language.

            Entries range from grammatical matters (like
agreement between various elements that ought to
agree), to questions of syntax (like the placement of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adjectives</ENAMEX>), to matters of semantics (like the discussion
of adequate ), to the meaning, usage, spelling,
inflection, and pronunciation of a large number of
words and phrases that might be confused ( adduce,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deduce</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plural</ENAMEX>/singular status of addendum, agenda ;
spelling of practice, practise ; plurals of words ending
in -o , etc.).  I agree with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s comments almost
entirely, but he fails to criticize severely enough
those who say i.e. and e.g. (rather than confine
their use solely to writing), and, in general, he seems
to avoid condemning poor style; also, the pronunciation
system he employs may be a little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> for this
sort of book, being derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moo Goo</ENAMEX> Gai
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of phonetics.

            On balance, though, it is a relief to see a well-rounded,
sensible approach to the questions of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grammar</ENAMEX>, usage, and other aspects of language <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilson</ENAMEX>
covers.  Would that we could do something to
induce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to use it!

            This welcome work is directed toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> who have the wit to harbor doubts about
their infallibility (which ought to include just about
anyone worthy of consideration as a professional).
As I have said on numerous occasions, books that
inform are of no use to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who think that they
know it all, for it never occurs to them to look up the
standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> spelling of words like programed,

            But let me interrupt: what is a frontispiece?  I
always thought it was a full-page illustration at the
front of a book.  I checked in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHD</ENAMEX> Unabridged
and found that definition.  What made me check was
a reference in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Preface</ENAMEX> to names listed
on the frontispiece.  Sure enough, on the page facing
the title page is a list of, among other things, the
contributing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>.  Maybe I was out of date with
my understanding of frontispiece , so I looked it up in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Writer's Guide</ENAMEX> itself.  Sure enough:


A frontispiece is an illustration that appears opposite
the title page.  If there is no frontispiece,
this page may contain a list of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s other
works or information about other books in the
series.
            

            New to me.  I checked in what I consider one of the
best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> on books, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glaister</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glossary</ENAMEX> of the
Book , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geoffrey Ashall Glaister</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California</ENAMEX>
Press, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2nd</TIMEX> edition, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glaister's</ENAMEX> has:


an illustration facing the title-page, either
printed with the prelims or separately pasted and
guarded into a book.

            

            From the wording, it is obvious that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glaister</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>,
and either frontispiece might not be used that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> or perhaps this is a new sense of frontispiece
not in use in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>.  I checked in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWIII</ENAMEX> and
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2e</ENAMEX> : neither yielded the definition sought
(though the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OED2e</ENAMEX> has a definition, labeled obsolete
and obviously not the meaning sought, the first
page of a book).  That may not seem <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an auspicious</TIMEX>
beginning, but we must not despair, for an authority‚Äîif
one is needed‚Äîmust be lurking somewhere:
either we have not found it or we must recognize
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX>'s right to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humpty-Dumpty</ENAMEX> meanings into
existence at a whim.

            The foregoing is not very important, but it does
show what can happen when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> keen on words
is let loose.

            A few of the names on the so-called frontispiece
are familiar, particularly that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Priscilla S. Taylor</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant editor</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Editorial Eye</ENAMEX> (or to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEI</ENAMEX>, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phi Beta</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kappa Newsletter</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> of formidable qualifications
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> whom I trust.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Writer's Guide</ENAMEX> is divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> parts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Usage</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grammar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Style, Preparing the Text</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Production</ENAMEX>
and Printing.  There is an annotated bibliography,
which lists my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford Theasurus</ENAMEX> but fails to
include notice of the myriad illustrative sentences it
contains.  I trust that I shall be forgiven for skimming
over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Usage</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, partly because much of it is
cut and dried and the parts that are not confuse the
issue of avoiding prejudice with political correctness,
a subject that gives me dyspepsia.  (It is beyond
me, for example, why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> should
be offended by the word orient , which is no more
than a reference to the place where the sun rises.)  I
shall also skip <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grammar</ENAMEX>, which seems quite straightforward
and predictable.  Scattered here and there
are helpful vignettes that focus on ancillary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">matters‚</ENAMEX>ÄîSPOTTING
A <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE</ENAMEX>, THE HISTORY
OF THE SEMICOLON, etc.

            In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> on Style, I expected to find under
punctuation a fuller treatment than that afforded: I
looked in vain for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> things, the wisdom offered regarding
serial commas (whether or when the second
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comma</ENAMEX> is required or desirable in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A</TIMEX>, B, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>, and
what the position is on the use of a comma following
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX> in the middle of a sentence).  I found neither, nor
did I find the common editorial term serial commas in
the Index, which seems a little thin.  It seemed best
not to try to go through the book systematically but
to dip into it here and there.  Good advice is given
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> hyphens and adverbs ending in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-ly</TIMEX> preceding
adjectives: were I being pernickety, I should say that
the word modifier is not necessarily applied only to
words that precede a noun, and that the rules change
when a modifier is in apositive or predicative position,
as in a well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> vs. a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> well known for
his generosity .  Would that it were possible to distill
the vagaries of English compounding into a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-page
table: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> are forced to offer comments like
equal titles of functions (equality is not always easy
to decide), words go together naturally (naturally
for whom?), etc., and even then to include a column
of exceptions.  (If you want my advice, settle on one
large dictionary as a standard and look up any compounds
it contains, following it slavishly: your writing
is more important than whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> has a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyphen</ENAMEX> or not.  However, that does not apply as consistently
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> as to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of what they are
editing.)

            I disagree with the suggested treatment of fractions,
in which we are told to write <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-eighths ,
etc.  Nonsense!  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two thirds</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> eighths
are exactly the same in construction as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thousand</NUMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three millions</NUMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> birdhouses.  <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX>
are perfectly legitimate nouns in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and do not
conform to the convention that requires eighty-six.
            

            In the section on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computers</ENAMEX>, I was particularly
interested in reading a vignette on spelling checkers
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 695</ENAMEX>), made to appear ludicrous, and on scanning
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 705</ENAMEX>).  I agree that no nonparsing checker could
find the error of writing ewe for you , wile for while ,
bin for been , or sum for some .  Such errors‚Äîbut not
halve for have‚Äîare unlikely if the text was written
by a literate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>.  In any event, I have found that
spelling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">checkers</ENAMEX> do find typographical errors that
result in nonwords (like fulkly for fully ), which result
from fast hunt-and-peck typing.  As far as scanning
goes, I have been shopping for a flatbed scanner
because there are many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> I am now using
that I should like to have in machine-readable form
for sorting and other processing.  The hand-held
scanner I have used is very tricky and sensitive, and,
as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Writer's Guide</ENAMEX> admonishes, creates as many
problems as it solves; but I am going to pursue the
subject nonetheless, hoping that a useful balance
might be struck in which less time is spent correcting
than in initial keyboarding plus correcting.

            In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Typography</ENAMEX>, information that
appears in an illustration (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 730</ENAMEX>) is somewhat misleading,
for the inference is that small capitals are
the same height as x-high letters of a given font.
That might not have been the implication, for small
caps are usually <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">sixty per cent</NUMEX> of cap height (though
there is no standard).  In the example shown, a sansserif
face, the x-height of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> is quite
large; in different faces, the x-height to cap-height
ratio varies, as does the small-cap height.  I have my
own notions of typographic design which are likely
to be at odds with those of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX>, and I
have seen fit to comment on particularly heinous examples
of design encountered in reviewing.  This is
not, however, the place to embark on a disputatious
wrangle leading nowhere.  Suffice it to say, I find
nothing serious to quibble with in the basic advice
given, though I would caution against using the
Guide as a quick course to typographic design.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Writer's Guide</ENAMEX> contains a huge amount of
useful information, and if one does not already have
a style manual, it might be as good as another,
though many would argue that nothing could equal
(let alone surpass) the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chicago Manual of Style</ENAMEX> .  If
one has become accustomed to a particular manual,
the temptation is to stay with it: it is like a comfortable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX> shoe; even when a new edition becomes
available, the information appears in approximately
the same place and in a familiar format.  Things are
changing, though, and I am a little surprised that I
have heard nothing about the availability of a style
manual integrated with the software of a word processing
package.

the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDAS</ENAMEX> is long-awaited would be to give away
no secret, for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguists</ENAMEX> have long been aware
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Lighter</ENAMEX>'s announcement of his project
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years ago</TIMEX>, and it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart Flexner</ENAMEX>'s coup to
grab it for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>.

            In his substantial Introduction, Lighter treats
several aspects of his subject, from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">What Is Slang</ENAMEX>?
through <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Slang in Its Cultural Environment</ENAMEX>, Some
Features of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slang</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The History of Slang, Influences on</ENAMEX>
Slang: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Military and Civilian, Slang in Other</ENAMEX> English-Speaking
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Countries</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Motives for Using Slang</ENAMEX> and a
final word, History of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Project</ENAMEX>, the last revealing
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>'s initial interest in such a project went
back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Introduction</ENAMEX> is followed by a Bibliography
with useful, brief annotations; the following
pages are occupied by the usual paraphernalia involved
in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide</ENAMEX>, etc.

            So many reviews of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDAS</ENAMEX> will have been
published in the press by the time this appears that
most of our comments will seem redundant.  Still, it
is useful to note a few things that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> are
likely to overlook or pay little or no heed.  For instance,
it is worth noting that although the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Regional English</ENAMEX> , edited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. Cassidy</ENAMEX>, serves as a source for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lighter</ENAMEX>, it is
not listed among the titles in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Selected Bibliography</ENAMEX>.
It is not in the slightest way suggested that
picking up citations from other works is in any way
curious or reprehensible‚Äîanyone would be a fool
to research any subject without relying on the scholarship
that has gone before‚Äîbut one would have
expected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARE</ENAMEX> to be found among books like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Farmer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Slang and Its</ENAMEX>
Analogues , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapman</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New Dictionary of Slang</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wentworth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flexner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of American</ENAMEX>
Slang , and the others listed.

            A dictionary is a reference book, not a text, and,
with few exceptions, its purpose is to provide a reliable
source of information about the words and
phrases <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> looks up.  It is not a text whose purpose
is to teach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> words that they do not already
know.  Yet the writing of a review puts a different
complexion on the use of a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>, and I have
often remarked that the most useful, realistic reviews
of such works can be written only after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
has lived with the subject book for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many months</TIMEX>,
using it all the while.  It is thus with some of the
reference books that I have edited: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> have told
me that although the style of a given work was unfamiliar
to them at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, they made the effort to master
it and were rewarded by information (and its
treatment) not available from books previously used.

            For many, slang and its treatment‚Äîhowever
clinical‚Äîis taboo, for it is loaded language, not so
much with the expected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-letter words (of which
there are only a handful) but with racial, religious,
and ethnic slurs, which are both derogatory and offensive
and are shunned like the plague by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX>.
A high percentage of slang consists of such matter.

            Like other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> who have not had the leisure
to become acquainted with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDAS</ENAMEX> gradually,
I am compelled to browse through, snatching
at pieces here and there.  Because of a recent criticism
I was recently moved to express concerning the
spelling of flack for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press agent</ENAMEX>, I looked it up and
found it under flack , where the fancied etymology is
quoted from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better English</ENAMEX> ([<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 28</TIMEX>] <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</TIMEX>):


That alert <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Variety</ENAMEX>...is trying to coin
the word flack as a synonym for publicity
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>.  The word is said to be derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>
Flack, a movie publicity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>... A <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>
word similar in sound means one who goes
around talking about the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX>'s business.

            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>'s comment is, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> word referred
to is unkn.; the closest words available are unlikely on
various grounds.  I have known the term for most of
my life, and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> was never a mystery to me;
still, I must allow that, like others, I am not immune
to succumbing to the trap of believing in the infallibility
of a fact that is simply not so.  My own etymology,
which seems painfully obvious, is revealed if
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> acknowledges that the proper spelling is flak ,
which at once clarifies the etymological origin: flak .
The metaphor is too transparent to waste the space
for an explanation.

            I confess to being less gregarious than the rest
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>: much of my contact with the
world comes through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">periodicals</ENAMEX>, radio, and television.
Consequently, I am known to vent my spleen
with a hearty Caramba!, a loancurseword not to
be found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDAS</ENAMEX> .  Neither is the (so-called by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">puzzlers</ENAMEX>) minced oath <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Egad</ENAMEX>! , which was uttered
by a blimpish comic-strip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> whose identity I
am too lazy to look up.  These interjections could be
considered marginal slang; but they are not so labeled
in dictionaries and do not meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lighter</ENAMEX>'s criteria.
On the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> in the good/bad egg
context is in, and I should not expect many dictionaries
to label that sense (in contrast to the aerial
bomb sense, which is slang) anything but Informal
or, depending on their style, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colloquial</ENAMEX> .  Still, the
labeling in dictionaries is not only erratic but internally
inconsistent.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX> Unabridged -
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> Edition labels fuck as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vulgar</ENAMEX> , but none of the
definitions given for that term in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dictionary</ENAMEX> itself
seems to fit.  The label for cunt is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slang</ENAMEX> ( vulgar ), and
the distinction is lost on me.  My vote would have
been for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taboo</ENAMEX> for all such terms (and these days
there are fewer and fewer).  The pattern of labeling
at shit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHD</ENAMEX> is quite arcane.  (I ought to mention
that, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managing Editor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Edition of</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHD</ENAMEX> , such matters fell into my purview, but
only shit (labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slang</ENAMEX> (vulgar) ) was entered in that
book.  I cannot recall the reasoning behind the label,
over which we agonized for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">many hours</TIMEX>, but it
means nothing to me now.)

            Noteworthy are shifts in language levels.  Dingbat ,
in the printing sense of a typographic ornament
[like the open book <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> at the end of this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX>], was once slang but is now standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cook</ENAMEX> , in the sense of juggle (the books), was once
standard but is now slang.  It would be interesting to
find more of these.

            Humility is a desirable attribute of those who
deal with language, and it ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">behooves purists</ENAMEX>
and precisions to turn their noses up at vulgarians
and others who fail to preserve the language in its
supposedly pristine condition.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> who cleave to
such attitudes may also scorn slang, but they are
very often unaware of the true pristine condition
of the language or of the origins of words that are
standard in contemporary speech.  Such people
should be advised that much, if not most slang is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metaphoric</ENAMEX> in origin and that much of it can be quite
subtle.  True, there is not much subtlety in calling
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cannon</ENAMEX> , a ship a canoe , or an incompetent
prizefighter a canvasback ; but that a canoe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector</ENAMEX>
is a gynecologist is not immediately obvious, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cement</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">City</ENAMEX> might be thought picturesquely oblique
for a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX>, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> lightning is certainly
as descriptive as rotgut for cheap potent liquor cannot
escape anyone's notice.  When overworked,
such images cloy, which is why slang is constantly
shifting and why some of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (like neat and
keen ) are occasionally recycled‚Äîwhy waste a good
word?  It must also be said that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>
more than any earlier time has seen the accumulation
of a more detailed documentation of life, as anyone
knows from the plethora of scratchy, saccadic,
often soundless images thrown on our television
screens: a series on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangsters</ENAMEX>, for instance,
repeats radio broadcasts of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX> and
30s, bringing to us vividly not only the pictorial
images of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> when, to modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>, everyone
wore black and white clothing and makeup but the
words and accents of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franklin D. Roosevelt</ENAMEX>, Huey
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Long</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Winchell</ENAMEX>, and others who epitomize
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>.  Such language ought not be allowed to go
to waste; it is ripe for recycling.

            What is also brought dramatically to the attention
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDAS</ENAMEX> is the relatively large
number of words and expressions that have remained
current in the language over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>.
Some have been retained by becoming standard, often
because there is no other convenient or adequately
descriptive standard term for the same
thing, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Charley horse</ENAMEX> for a leg cramp; others are
genuinely standard words but were applied in a
slang context, like chassis for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>; many
are not frequent enough to have bored their users
sufficiently to drop them, like chew out for scold;
some might have been dropped by those who are in,
only to be picked up by the squares to make themselves
appear to be in, like cheeba for (a) cannabis
(cigarette).  Many have little use <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> but are colorful,
like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> piano or typewriter for machine
gun.  Some have experiential reference for some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> but are obscurely metaphoric for others, like
catbird seat vantage point, which is often treated as
arcane but which is meaningful to anyone who has
seen the way a catbird alights on a tree <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> from
where the surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> can be surveyed for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">provender</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predators</ENAMEX>.

            As one might expect, I enjoy reading dictionaries,
but some make more interesting reading than
others.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDAS</ENAMEX> should serve not only as superb
documentation of an aspect of the language too often
left to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">amateurs</ENAMEX> among whom most professional
lexicographers, including me, must be counted but
also as an engaging colorful source of the pleasure to
be derived from revelation and reminiscence.  Further
volumes are eagerly awaited.

            Those of us who deal with the lexicographic
side of language are well aware of what Jeans characterizes
as the astonishing debt that our idiomatic
speech owes to the nautical language of the past.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Preface, p. ix</ENAMEX>) There are the obvious examples‚Äî
come adrift, go overboard (about something), get under
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> , even <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">skyscraper ‚Äîbut</ENAMEX> there are far more
common words and expressions that have a far more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subtle</ENAMEX>, less direct connection with maritime affairs,
some of which I shall come to.  The only quibble I
might have with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeans</ENAMEX>'s statement is with his use of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">astonishing</ENAMEX> , for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> was born and nurtured on an
island culture that depended heavily on the sea for
food, commerce, and transport.  Perhaps what is
astonishing is the increasing distance, chiefly during
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past century</TIMEX>, that landlubbers have put between
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sea</ENAMEX> and themselves: knowledge and awareness of
such matters now rests largely among naval <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX>,
those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yachtsmen</ENAMEX> who enjoy the leftover jargon of
the sea, and a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eccentrics</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeans</ENAMEX>, a few
others I could mention, and me.  My own connection
stems from a lifetime of sailing, a brief stint in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII US Navy</ENAMEX>, and an abiding lexicographic
concern for terms nautical, the last of which is manifesting
itself in the preparation of a historical nautical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX>.

            Jeans, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> as his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spellings</ENAMEX> confirm,
has ferreted about in the language to uncover words
and phrases that have‚Äîand might have‚Äîsome nautical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">provenance</ENAMEX>.  He has not always been successful,
but, undaunted, he <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> on.  In a random
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">browse</ENAMEX> through the book jerry-built caught my eye,
mainly because, recalling it as a reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ashore</ENAMEX>, I was surprised to find it among nautical
words.  Jeans does not deny that‚Äîindeed, provides
his own quotation from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pall Mall Gazette</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 1884</TIMEX>, (not listed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the OED2e</TIMEX> ) to support
the architectural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">reference‚</ENAMEX>Äîbut he persists in offering
the opinion that because the word is used in association
with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Liverpool</ENAMEX>, this makes it
... likely that the word is of nautical origin.  That
is imaginative but unsupported by the evidence, and
I fear that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeans</ENAMEX> has stretched a point.  My suspicions
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aroused</ENAMEX>, I found that a number of entries had
neither a nautical origin nor, perceivably, any nautical
connection: jingo , offered as probably a Basque
word, acquires a nautical connection because
Basques were among the earliest organised whalers
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, and as harpooners their expressions
would have carried some weight with other seafarers.
That is a fancied nautical origin at best.  Kedgeree ,
a vegetable curry, popular with seamen,
has, notwithstanding tarry appetites, not the remotest
connection with matters nautical; kickback is
shown by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the OED2e</TIMEX> to be a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">coinage</ENAMEX>,
and there is not evidence to suggest it ever had anything
to do with maritime affairs; and kite , for which
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">OED2e</NUMEX> includes a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7th-century</TIMEX> quotation for the
(original) bird sense, found a metaphoric application
to sail not much before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the 19th</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>.

            I must say that I was quite disappointed to find
the foregoing examples; alas! there are many more.
Of course, there are genuine nautical expressions as
well, some of which have been given thorough treatment:
I have not seen elsewhere as complete a discussion
of loggerheads , but it is offset by the very
inclusion of mind your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">q's</ENAMEX> , about which Jeans
writes, the phrase is not nautical in origin.  If not,
then why is it here?  Why is space devoted to entries
like misfire, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morse</ENAMEX> code, muster, nickname, nip short
drink, nous brains, slate , etc.?  Either the author
lost his way or, as often happens, the (original, probably
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> was dissatisfied with a
shorter book for which less could be charged.  As it
is, the book is greatly bulked up: its wide hanging
indentions, large type, ragged-right setting, open
spaces make for an attractive package; the illustrations
are pretty and, in some cases (various sails),
useful, but many of them are gratuitous and purely
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decorative</ENAMEX> ( helm, scrimshaw , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> pages of different
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rigs</ENAMEX>).

            Consequently, I did not expect much when I
looked up my favorite entry, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">latitudes</ENAMEX> , for
which Jeans repeats the conventional theory (to the
effect that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> used to throw starving
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses overboard</ENAMEX> when they were becalmed, which
I maintain to be an incredibly poor fiction); he also
brings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Golfo de las Yeguas</ENAMEX> gulf of mares, which I
have been able to find, with the help of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geographical Society</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only</NUMEX> inland in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.  Jeans
mentions one modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>, whose identity I
should like to know, who makes the intriguing
suggestion that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> aboard sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> often
had to be lifted overboard into the sea to relieve
their thirst, a theory that even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeans</ENAMEX> regards as ludicrous.

            There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> appendices: Nautical Prepositions
(many of which would be classed (also) as adverbs
by a grammarian); <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Changed Spellings</ENAMEX> and Corrupted
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Word Forms; Nautical Terms Related</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Anatomy; Nautical Terms Derived</ENAMEX> from the
Land.  There is also a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bibliography</ENAMEX> of sorts: the OED
was, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the OED2e</TIMEX> was not consulted; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brewer</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Phrase & Fable</ENAMEX> was, perhaps somewhat
uncritically; and, among works that either fail to reflect
the latest scholarship, are not pertinent to the
task set, or are just plain awful, the following are
listed: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilfred Funk</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Word Origins</ENAMEX> and Their Romantic
Stories , (a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX> reprint of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX> work); <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1897</TIMEX>); a
modern selection from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755</TIMEX>);
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Partridge's Origins</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>), a work long criticized for
its errors; and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX>), which is a
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15</NUMEX> reprint, cursorily updated, of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX>
Ogilvie edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annandale</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX> .  Some of
these are useless and inaccurate, others are picturesque
but useless.  In all, aside from the dictionaries,
Jeans lists <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> books plus fifteen of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patrick</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Brian</ENAMEX>'s novels; no mention is made of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mariner</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirror</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society of Nautical</ENAMEX>
Research, or of other essential source materials.
Nautical language deserves more respect.  By contrast,
the bibliography for my historical nautical dictionary
already <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">numbers</ENAMEX> close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">285</NUMEX> works.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX>
should not for a moment think that my adverse
criticism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeans</ENAMEX>'s book has anything remotely to do
with my own: the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are of entirely different purpose
and scope, and I would have welcomed any
help or new insight into some of the problems and
questions that vex anyone trying to deal with such
an elusive subject as nautical language.

            Tisk tisk, said the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>.

            I know because I was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five feet</NUMEX> away and I heard
her.  Only after I had ferried my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cart</ENAMEX> to the next
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aisle</ENAMEX> did I figure out what she meant: tsk tsk , that
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-pitying, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-disapproving sound made by pressing
the tongue against the upper palate and teeth
and sucking in slightly.  She had obviously read the
expression tsk tsk somewhere, and this was how she
concluded that it should sound.  Or her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> had
made the mistake and passed it on.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> often
spell it tchah , and I wondered whether some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">matron</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harrod's</ENAMEX> wasn't even now saying cha
for the same reason.

            The alteration of tsk to tisk is like the back-formation
of certain words.  Someone comes up with
a spelling to approximate a sound, which someone
else eventually reads, mispronounces, and thus turns
into a new sound.  Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>, the new sound
may acquire its own distinction: a dignified gentleman
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">announcing Ahem</ENAMEX>! to gain attention, rather
than actually clearing his throat, or someone cackling
Yukkety yuk yuk! at a lousy joke.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Onomatopoeia</ENAMEX> adds zest to language, from
aagh! to zzz ..., but somewhere between print and
enunciation, the exact equivalence between sound
and sense can get lost.  In fact, I recently heard
someone pronounce zzz ... to mimic sleep, and it
sounded nothing like the faint sussurus that the
word implies.  There are linguistic terms for these
sorts of sounds, from bilabial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">implosives‚Äîa kiss</ENAMEX> becomes
a smooch ‚Äîto dental or alveolar stops‚Äî tut
tut , scolds the cautious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX>.  In a few rare instances,
one can actually see the transmogrification
at work.  The childish exclamation peeyoo! , for instance,
probably stems from a distorted rendering of
phew! , just as another air-and-spit expression of disgust
was once rendered as pfui! but gradually turned
into fooey! , which is both easier to read and pronounce.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">near relative</ENAMEX>, the mucus release known as
something like huk-ptui , has similarly eased into the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">accipitrine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawk patooie</ENAMEX>.  The polite forms may still
be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hem</ENAMEX> and haw , but the polite forms are from a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bygone</ENAMEX> era.  Others have supplanted them.

            In fact, the amount of back-formed onomatopoeia
devoted to sounds of human manufacture is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">astounding</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> now exclaim whew! after a close
call, or humph or harrumph when impatient.  But
these sounds are meant to be said in haste and
slurred slightly, so that whew comes across as a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-whistled
expulsion of breath, not a precise word
with the wh of what and the ew of ewer .  The same is
true of humph , a nasal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snort</ENAMEX> of derision rather than
something akin to what a camel has on its back.
When you become disgusted, the sound from your
throat sounds like a gathering of phlegm, variously
rendered as ugh, yuk , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mad</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s famous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">yecch ‚Äîbut</ENAMEX> often when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> repeat those sounds,
what comes out is ug, yuck , and even yetch .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ick</ENAMEX> also
belongs somewhere in there.  Certain aspects of revulsion,
such as eeeuew! (a guess as to the spelling),
still have no agreed-upon form.

            Other spelled-out bodily reactions range from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eructation</ENAMEX> to fright, though admittedly people
sometimes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-pronounce the sounds for a humorous
effect.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L'il Abner</ENAMEX>'s Gulp! might have shown that
his heart was in his throat, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> when
someone says gulp , it is more likely tongue in cheek.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gasp</ENAMEX>! says someone is more amused than scared.
Yikes, yipes, eek , and eep now function similarly, the
last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> originally mimicking the response of someone
encountering a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> in a darkened <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>.  In
fact, the sheer pronunciation of the letters in sounds
like the lip-smacking yum yum or the postprandial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urp</ENAMEX> and sigh provokes a chuckle.

            Laughter itself has its own onomatopoetic
codes.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ha</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ha</NUMEX>, he-he , or hee-hee may be the closest
spelled-out equivalents, with te-hee as a feminine
version, dating back to the laugh that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaucer</ENAMEX> assigned
the reeve's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tale</ENAMEX>.  Hardy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">har har</ENAMEX> is the hearty masculine equivalent, a guffaw
compared to a titter.  But retro-punk culture now
dominates the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arena</ENAMEX> of cachinnation, with Beavis
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Butthead</ENAMEX>'s heh-heh ... heh-heh ... echoing
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTV</ENAMEX> to the schoolyards.  The only appropriate
response is boo-hoo .

            Comic books also contribute a lot to this fracas.
Much comic-book onomatopoeia comes from the
fights of good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> versus bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX>, specifically the
sound of fists against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bif</ENAMEX> and bam were early
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">favorites</ENAMEX>, followed by an off!  Then newer impacts
came along, pow and kazowie , and in this age of electronic
armaments, whoosh and zap have replaced the
standard artillery bang bang and rat-a-tat-tat .

            
               Bloosh , spotted in both <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">X-Men and Superman</ENAMEX> , is
the sound a body makes when hitting the water and
sinking.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fzzssh</ENAMEX> and fwwwp indicate sudden appearance
and disappearance (or materialization and dematerialization)
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Captain America</ENAMEX> comic books.
And while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archie comics</ENAMEX> are still using the old standbys
of crunch and swish , the heavier impacts of action
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comics</ENAMEX> have gone beyond boom and kablooie to
ktoom, bdoom , and even skrakataboom for the detonation
of an entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>.  Similarly, the old elastic
collision of boing sounds tame compared to the
clash of metal on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX>: bladang .  Of course, these
words appear simply as large colored letters within a
given frame, but if you have ever read a comic book
to a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> perched on your lap, you have
had to figure out a pronunciation key.  Luckily, since
most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comics</ENAMEX> are aimed at those with unsophisticated
reading skills, most of the onomatopoeia inside is
spelled the way it sounds.  The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> puzzlement is
how to pronounce comic puzzlement, variously
spelled as ??? or ?!
            

            Beyond the realm of human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ken</ENAMEX> lie animal
sounds, a fine mess for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.  Again, the villain
is precise pronunciation: with the possible exception
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Orphan Annie</ENAMEX>'s dog <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandy</ENAMEX>, no mutt
barks arf .  The same is true of woof and bow-wow ,
though all dogs can be heard to approximate these
sounds.  If only <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> could spell.  Cats only vaguely
cry meow (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Joyce</ENAMEX> bravely tried mkgnao ), hapless
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX> have the choice of only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oink</ENAMEX> or ooee , horses
bray neigh and mules hee-haw .  The rooster crows
cock-a<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-doodle-doo</ENAMEX> , which for anyone who has spent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> is a sad travesty of the deep, throaty
ur-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ur-ur-ur-urrh</ENAMEX>!  In other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> are
similarly saddled with precisely imprecise sound effects,
such as gnaf-gnaf for a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">poodle</ENAMEX>, or wanwan
for a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> akita.

            Of course, these vile approximations are not always
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>'s fault.  The ruminative uh , which
most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can faithfully reproduce, used to be
spelled as unh , in an attempt to get in that glottal
effect, but all it did was mislead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> into pronouncing
an n where none was intended.  Some old
novels similarly have characters expressing surprise
by hanh? in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> before the ubiquitous huh?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi-Cola</ENAMEX>'s famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Uh-huh</ENAMEX>! commercials have
made bare assent into a ringing affirmative, though
no one has yet done a similar campaign on uh-uh .

            Nowadays the unh or ungh combination tends to
convey exertion or being stifled.  But then, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
have always had trouble with ch and gh .  Blame
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loch Lomond</ENAMEX>, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
language that produces such sentences as The
tough cough ploughs him through.  This may be
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason, besides orthographic brevity, that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American English</ENAMEX> has changed doughnuts to donuts
and hiccough to hiccup .

            Even sounds that should be simple to execute,
such as ah , and oh , have hidden traps.  Is it eh as
in pest , or eh as in pay ?  It depends on whether you
are in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>.  When ah is drawn out to
ahhhhhh! , it evokes deep satisfaction, but spelled as
aaaaaah! , it is more a sign of fright.  In the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> often try to convey a drawn-out oh by
writing oooooh , which should be another sound entirely,
with the u of tube .  Maybe those who want to
prolong oh by more than a breath should learn to
write ohhhhhh .

            Perhaps the logical endpoint of onomatopoetic
spelling is eye-dialect, as in wimmin for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
gotcha for got you , and so on.  Victuals , still the correct
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spelling</ENAMEX>, has yielded an alternate version
spelled vittles .  Will solder spelled as sodder come
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next</TIMEX> (for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> pronunciation)?  It would be
a shame to lose the etymology buried in the original
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spelling</ENAMEX>, though it would be a boon for easy pronunciation.
Or maybe some sounds will never have absolute
phonetic accuracy bestowed on them, as in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ring ‚Äîor</ENAMEX> is it rrring , or some other sound altogether?
Can a sudden intake of breath be shown
as hi , or does that monosyllable have too friendly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>?  Mood and personal intonation also
play a part in many sounds: is oops meant to be ups ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ups</ENAMEX> , or whoops ?  And what should one make of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rappers</ENAMEX>' cry,  Whoomp! ‚Äîthere it is!, when they
spot a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> with big breasts?

            Questions multiply quickly‚Äî sproing .  What really
is whir meant to imitate?  Where does wow
come from?  How does whoosh! manage to maintain
its phonic integrity?  Is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> in buzz really necessary?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaak</ENAMEX> is often used for gagging, but gag itself
was originally onomatopoetic, which raises the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thorny</ENAMEX> issue of how much language was all imitative
at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time.  In place of answers, a thoughtful hmmm
... will have to suffice.

            I am very fond of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language, to which I
took a great fancy when I was twelve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX>.
It is no exaggeration when I say that I prefer <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
to my native tongue, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malayalam</ENAMEX>, the language spoken
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerala</ENAMEX>, a southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>,
the language which has entered the pages of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guinness Book of Records</ENAMEX> as the longest palindromic
language in the world.  To tell the truth, it is the
little knowledge that I have of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language
that has made me what I am now.  Had it not been
for this knowledge, I would not have been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> and an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>.

            I know that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> has merits and demerits.
Not all ideas that arise in my mind in my own tongue
can be expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as well because not all
words, phrases, sayings, and usages in my mother
tongue have English equivalents.  It was when I was
a high-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> that I became convinced of
this fact for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmate</ENAMEX> of mine came to me <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one afternoon</TIMEX>
with a question.  As I was the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>,
he expected a correct answer.  What he asked
me was, How can we ask a question in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> that
elicits an ordinal number as answer?  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abraham Lincoln</ENAMEX>
was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>; try to form a
question to which the answer is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th</TIMEX>.  I was‚Äî
still am‚Äîat a loss for an answer.

            When, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years back</TIMEX>, I started writing an
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English language</ENAMEX> column entitled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">English Corner in</ENAMEX>
a well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malayalam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, it became evident, from the letters of
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, that most of them wanted to know how
to ask such a question.  I had already learnt that although
there is no idiomatic way in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> of asking
such a question, it is very common in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malayalam</ENAMEX> and
also, I think, in other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vernaculars</ENAMEX>.  Unlike
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, those languages do not distinguish between
order or position.

            As a consequence, we have found our own ways
of asking such questions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  I have collected
the following ones:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.  What is the rank/position/ordinal number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>/among the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">presidents</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>?

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.  What is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chronological</ENAMEX>/numerical order
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>/among the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">presidents</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>?

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.  Which of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> is Bill
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>?

            

            But none of them is really acceptable as idiomatic to
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> one would be acceptable
to them if it is changed into Where, in the
numerical order of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>, does
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> come?

            Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randolph Quirk</ENAMEX>, the most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>
grammarian, says that the ordinal question can be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">obliquely</ENAMEX> asked in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> like this: How many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">presidents</ENAMEX> were there before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>?  But
such a question does not satisfy us.  Our answer to
that question will be the total number of former
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">presidents</ENAMEX>.

            I have recently come to know that it is correct
in colloquial <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> speech to ask What number
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>?  In my estimation,
this question is undoubtedly the best solution.

            Recently, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> of my column sent me a letter
asking me whether it would be correct to use
How manieth to form an ordinal question.  How
many yields answers with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinal numbers</ENAMEX> like
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>, fifteen: How many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have you?  I
have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> .  Then, what about using How <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">manieth</ENAMEX>/
How manyeth for an answer that contains an ordinal
number like <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX>, fifteenth?  Unfortunately,
How manieth <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> is Bill
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>? does not exist in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.

            Do you know any other good ways of asking
such a question in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>?  If you do, please let me
know of them so that I can include them in my next
book on enjoyable <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  I will give you credit.

Part <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, almost any word can become an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ism</ENAMEX>.
Rather than turn this into a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-volumes set, they
continue, we decided to limit the words included
to those noted in one of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> dictionaries or
used in a recent book, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>.  All
the more surprising, then that they missed, among
the available <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">-Ologies & -Isms</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Urdang</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gale Research Company</ENAMEX>, published in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three</TIMEX> editions (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978, 1981</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>).  Considering
the fact that there are not a lot of books dealing with
isms, one might have expected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altendorfs</ENAMEX> to
have found that one.

            Still, that has nothing to do with the present
work, which focuses on isms alone and is far more
thorough in its detailed treatment and explanations
of the nature of isms not treated in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">-Ologies & -Isms</ENAMEX> .
The selection does not exclude ordinary language,
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldwynism</ENAMEX>, hermaphroditism, iotacism, opportunism,
optimism , and toadyism are included among
the scores of entries.  I am not sure whether to categorize
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the preceding as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Concepts</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doctrines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Traits, or Beliefs</ENAMEX>, but no matter.  The
definitions are quite good and straightforward, despite
the facetious tone of the prefatory matter and
the illustrations.  It seems that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> enjoyed
their labors, and they have produced a work which
I consider a valuable, useful addition to anyone's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">laughter</ENAMEX>, but if they have no effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX>,
they are consigned to oblivion.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Submitters</ENAMEX> should

Also, we must have the name of the periodical or call

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIC</ENAMEX>!¬≥s are usually saved up for typesetting in
batches.  Because they are used as fillers, they might
not be used for some time, depending on how long
they are and on filling needs.  If they start looking a
bit hoary, we discard them on the grounds that there
are always new ones appearing, and, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>, language
changes are so rapid that a usage might have
become standard by the time a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year</TIMEX> interval has
passed.

            Reflections on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unitedstatesese</ENAMEX> and other-eses



            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Toynbee</ENAMEX>, distinguished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosopher</ENAMEX> of
history, in his old age wrote about his having learned
about the difference between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> language
and my native <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Unitedkingdomese</ENAMEX>.  He said
that as a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> recently out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1911</TIMEX>
he encountered <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> other than the few
highly educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rhodes scholars</ENAMEX> he had met at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>.
He then became aware of the significant differences
between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Englishes</ENAMEX> and of the increasing
dominance of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX>.  He told about
this in his book of reminiscences and reflections, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Experiences</ENAMEX>,
which was published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years</TIMEX>
before his death:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX> was now in a minority in the English-speaking
World.  The majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> whose
language was <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> were now living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American English</ENAMEX> had become
the standard form of the language.  It was irrelevant
that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> had been spoken in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> long before
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> had been heard of in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.  History
never stands still; and this had reduced my Unitedkingdomese
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dialect</ENAMEX> to the status of being a bizarre
provincial brogue.

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toynbee</ENAMEX>'s dialect actually was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Englandese</ENAMEX>: Scotlandese
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irelandese</ENAMEX> are quite distinct from that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dialect</ENAMEX>.  And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unitedstatesese</ENAMEX> had become a linguistic
reality before the thirteen <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> had rebelled
and declared their independence.  Soon after
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Revolution</ENAMEX> several of the founding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>
of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> advocated establishing an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">academy</ENAMEX>, similar to those of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX>, to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">standardize</ENAMEX> and, in effect, enshrine an official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
form of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">academy</ENAMEX> was not established.
Soon after the independence treaty between
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Britain</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> had been signed
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1784</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noah Webster</ENAMEX>, then in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-twenties</TIMEX>, issued
his book, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grammatical Institute of the English</ENAMEX>
Language.  This was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of the several books
which made him a leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unitedstatesese</ENAMEX>,
and in some ways a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creator</ENAMEX> of it.  His most
important work, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The American Dictionary of the English</ENAMEX>
Language, was published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1812</TIMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Today‚Äîas</ENAMEX> English-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in all parts
of the world should be aware‚Äîthere are several distinct
dialects in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX>.  The predominant
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, which in itself has sub-dialects, is conveniently
called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General American</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts</ENAMEX> estimate that
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two thirds</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, living on
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80 per cent</NUMEX> of the land area speak this dialect‚Äîor
with this accent, if one prefers that term.
(The terms are not quite synonymous, but in this
context they can be taken as such.)  Recently a polished,
precise form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General American</ENAMEX> has come
to be called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Network Standard</ENAMEX>: it is the speech of
many of the prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX>
on national television.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Canadian English‚</ENAMEX>ÄîCanadese?‚Äîis closer
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General American</ENAMEX> than it is to any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
Englishes, but it is distinct from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> ones in
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spellings</ENAMEX>, usages, and pronunciations and in a
few peculiar intonations.

         
         
            Borrowings




            Borrowed words fill gaps in a language for which
they were not designed, much as if one were
to take pieces from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> jig-saw puzzle and use them
in another which happens to be missing a few.  Or,
to use another simile, they are like <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> transplanted
to an alien climate: sometimes the shrub
loses its spreading habit or becomes dwarfed; sometimes
it expands luxuriantly, taking up more space
than when on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> ground; occasionally, it keeps
its original shape and size.

            These were some of my reflections as, more
than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade ago</TIMEX>, I watched the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> news
broadcasts and accompanying advertisements.  By
then.  I had lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than two decades</TIMEX>
and was aware of the many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> words also
at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> there; but now, I was struck not just by the
large number but by their use in official <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>.
Until then, I think I had assumed that only the
everyday speech of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and
the very demotic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> of some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> had incorporated these borrowings.  In
the space of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks</TIMEX>, I jotted down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">loanwords</ENAMEX>, most of which could be
grouped under the headings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entertainment</ENAMEX>,
Food, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Games and Sports, Technology</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation.</ENAMEX>

            Predictably, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> has given a good many
words to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Modern Greek</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cowboy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detective</ENAMEX>, gangster,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thriller</ENAMEX>, western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">‚Äîall</ENAMEX> refer to film categories,
though gangster (or, rather, gangsterism ) can be
many kinds of coercive behavior, even schoolyard
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bullying</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Picnic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX>, striptease , and video have entered
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> with their meanings intact, rock considerably
narrowed, confined as it is to rock music.
Camping , however, is a place, not an activity, and
cocktail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> has shrunk to kokt√©l , while show and
star refer only to the theater.

            In the area of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacon</ENAMEX>, bar where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> are
served, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX>, cornflakes, cornflour, custard powder
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pudding mix</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ketchup</ENAMEX>, popcorn , and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX> have retained their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> meanings.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Baking</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">powder</ENAMEX> has been shortened to mp√©kin ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quaker oats</ENAMEX>
is kou√°ker ; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> style potato chips are ts√≠ps ; and
anyone who orders t√≥st in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> will be served not
toast but a grilled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese sandwich</ENAMEX>.  S√°ntou√Øts itself‚Äîtwo
thick chunks of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> with nothing between
them but a thin slice of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> or salami‚Äîis
not exactly what <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have in mind; and, although
there are sn√°kmpar in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>, there are no
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sn√°k</ENAMEX> , for the very good reason that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">meze</ENAMEX> was
in use long before snackbars arrived on the scene.

            But perhaps the greatest number of loanwords
has been provided by games and sports.  Some have
been trimmed: <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> , to mp√°sket .  Others are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unaltered</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX>, golf, jogging, ping
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pong</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">soccer</ENAMEX>, surfing, tennis, volleyball, water polo .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, foul, goal , (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, match, out ,
and rally have, in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, none but the meanings
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pertaining</ENAMEX> to games and sports.  A record-breaker or
-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX> is a r√©korntman (or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">r√©korntgouman</NUMEX>) , no
doubt coined by some enterprising sports rep√≥rter
or sp√≠ker ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker announcer</ENAMEX>).

            Technology and transportation have yielded
computer, laser, transistor , and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">watt</NUMEX> , all unchanged
in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, as are bulldozer, ferryboat, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> , and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yacht</ENAMEX>.  Pullman , however, is a large, long-distance
bus most of the time (occasionally, a city <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>), and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">station-wagon</ENAMEX> has lost its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon</ENAMEX> .

            Allowing, as always, for a difference in pronunciation,
many other words are perfectly recognizable
and many acronyms, too ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOB</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">UFO</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>).  Nevertheless, the usage of
some recognizable words can certainly muddle conversations
between foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">English-speakers</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flirt</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gk</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phl√©rt</ENAMEX> ) is no longer a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who
indulges in harmless dalliance but a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> or
female or the love affair itself (more often than
not, illicit); hula hoop means leotards; nylon is the
transparent kind of plastic; shocking, used as a plural
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noun</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gk</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s√≥kin</ENAMEX> ), means off-color or risqu√© stories;
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> , as in the sentence, It has become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">texas</ENAMEX>,
means out of control, maniacally chaotic and violent
(though this may be an idiosyncratic use by a
small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>).

            Words that are or become nouns in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assigned</ENAMEX> articles indicating gender, and some words
are also inflected like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> nouns; but the majority,
become uninflected neuters, which, anyway, have
fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inflections</ENAMEX> than feminines or masculines, so
that a change in the article is often the only indication
of case and syntax.  One inference to be drawn
from this might be that the choice of neuter is inevitable
since the gender of most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">nouns</ENAMEX> is inscrutable.
Another inference might be that the same
tolerance displayed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> in their dealings with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident foreigners‚</ENAMEX>Äîat any rate, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
ones‚Äîhas been extended to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words
which are, as noted, largely exempted from the
strictures of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> grammar and allowed to retain
their alien habit.  A third‚Äîperhaps only a corollary
to the second‚Äîmight be that the longer a borrowing
remains in use, the more likely it is to be treated
like a native.  Recordwoman , if it was not a nonce
word and is still in use, may be an example of this:
though obviously feminine, it was uninflected,
whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> of much longer
standing, has acquired all the inflections of a feminine
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noun</ENAMEX>.  Further evidence is that the many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>
loanwords, in use for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> and with no obvious
preponderance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gender, are, with very
few exceptions, fully inflected, as are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> musical
and nautical terms, likewise of long standing.  In
short, it seems that a process of naturalization has
been and may still be at work.

            If, in the future, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> continues to be
as hospitable to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words as it has been in the
recent past, there are likely to be more and more
neuter nouns with few inflections or none at all, at
least until the new words have put down roots.  Still,
because these borrowed, aberrant words represent
relatively rare infractions of the time-honored rules
of grammar, I doubt that matters will ever reach the
point where literate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> would be driven to
gnashing of teeth and tearing of hair by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
equivalents of barbarisms such as to you and I and Us
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> are ....  Such trials and temptations to mayhem
are reserved for the literate‚Äîand hapless‚Äî
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
         
         
            Living with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fossilized Ears</ENAMEX>




            I returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> after spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>.  Since then, I have had to do
almost as much readjusting to this changed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>
as I did when I moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time.  I
expected many details of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life to have changed
or to be unfamiliar, but I was not prepared for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> in the pronunciation of words which had
occurred in such a relatively short time.  I have also
noticed a sharp acceleration in the decline of dialectal
usages, less in pronunciation than in vocabulary: I
find that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in my own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suffolk</ENAMEX>,
for example, no longer know dialect words and expressions
that were universal currency as recently as
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>.

            Some quite common words have undergone
striking changes.  I am still waiting for somebody to
explain to me just how and when yoghurt , which had
always been pronounced YOH\?\gert, mysteriously
metamorphosed into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOG</ENAMEX>\?\ert.  At first I suspected
that some television advertising campaign had
caused the change, but then I remembered that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Band Margarine</ENAMEX> commercials of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> and
1960s never did succeed in reviving the old pronunciation
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">margarine</ENAMEX> with a hard g .

            It seems that nobody calls the police any more;
they dial <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">999</NUMEX> for the pleece .  If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> sink into the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">earth</ENAMEX>, the cause is no longer subsidence , pronounced
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUB'sidence</ENAMEX>, it is subSIDE\?\ence, an obvious back-formation
from the verb subside .  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> of
my own home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suffolk</ENAMEX> used to be noted for
pronouncing the word wholly to rhyme with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bully</ENAMEX> ,
just as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth</ENAMEX> I would have done, while everyone
else rhymed it with holy .  I keep hearing it pronounced
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HOL\</ENAMEX>?\ly.  How did this start?

            It is possible that radio and TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">announcers</ENAMEX> are
to blame, although the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Blue Band example</ENAMEX> shows
that TV is not accepted as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> on pronunciation,
when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purchasers</ENAMEX> of the product kept on
calling it marjoreen in spite of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s
instructions to the contrary.

            TV and radio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcers</ENAMEX> seem to obey changes
in pronunciation rather than initiating them.  I find
myself often confused by the accelerating trend
towards adopting back vowels in diphthongs to replace
front vowels.  I was baffled for quite a long
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> by a conversation on a bus, in which someone
announced that because the cool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> weather
had arrived they were going to buy a kite .  I was
trying to speculate on how a kite could keep you
warm when I finally realized from the context that
they were planning to purchase a coat .

            This particular alteration in pronunciation seems
to have been widely accepted.  Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> now
seem to live in a hice rather than a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, and this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pronunciation</ENAMEX> is by no means confined to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Royalty</ENAMEX> and
the aristocracy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of the famed Received Pronunciation
Plus.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Buerk</ENAMEX>
is an invariant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> of this diphthong for what was
formerly a low back diphthong.  He stumped me
when reporting that the dissident <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrei</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sakharov</ENAMEX> had been shited dine when trying to
speak in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sakharov</ENAMEX> had of
course, been shouted down.  It would be an interesting
experiment for phoneticians to ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Buerk</ENAMEX>
to recite the line how now brown <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX> .

            There seem to me to be numerous explanations
for these phenomena.  The continuing drift from back
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vowels</ENAMEX> to front vowels is surely no more than the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">continuation of the Great Vowel Shift</ENAMEX>, which began in
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifteenth century</TIMEX>.  Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX>
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Himalayas</ENAMEX>, it is a process that is so slow that
we cannot perceive it happening.

            Another factor, not quite as old although not a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">novelty</ENAMEX>, either, is the pressure of the speak-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as</NUMEX>-you-spell
movement <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> described by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fowler brothers</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Modern English Usage</ENAMEX> .  The pronunciation of
place names has been tending to conform to their
written appearance ever since the coming of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">railways</ENAMEX>, and I notice that the letter t is now always
sounded in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hertfordshire</ENAMEX> , as is the letter l in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colchester</ENAMEX> .
The speak-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as</NUMEX>-you-spell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faction</ENAMEX> have definitely
won a final victory over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fowlers</ENAMEX> when it
comes to the word conduit .  The pronunciation
KON\?\dewit has now established itself as the standard
form, and there is no point in trying to revive
KUN\?\dit.  The same applies to untoward: the once-correct
pronunciation unTOE\?\erd is dead and might
as well be buried.

            Now of course conduit and untoward are not
words common in everyday conversation, so it is
hardly surprising that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have to say them
for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time they guess the pronunciation from
the spelling, always a dangerous procedure in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
It is a puzzle, though, that the verb conflict
should have had its stress changed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CON</ENAMEX>\?\flict so as to
conform to the stress in the noun conflict .

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> important lesson to be learned from these
changes is that the expected tendency of recordings
to stabilize pronunciation has not in fact happened.
When sound recording was first invented, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,
remembering how the invention of printing had
frozen grammar in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> forms, thought
that recordings would do the same for the spoken
language.  I can remember that as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late as the 1950s</TIMEX>
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> conscientiously pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glue</ENAMEX> as
glyoo, and went to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> wearing a syoot.
I have not heard suit pronounced that way for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>.

            One might look ahead <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a hundred years</TIMEX> to imagine
the squeaky <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> pronunciation of the late 21st
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, all front vowels, and with a heavy rhythm
caused by habitual stressing of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> syllable in
words.  Perhaps Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> sounded something like
that.

            My <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, who has lived in English-speaking
environments since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</TIMEX>, still uses the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> pronunciations and expressions from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that period</TIMEX>,
to the great amusement of her younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>.
I find it fascinating to observe the parallel
changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> pronunciation, particularly so
because everyone I ask assures me that no such
changes have taken place and that everyone has always
called yoghurt YOG\?\ert.  It is strange that a back
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vowel</ENAMEX> has displaced a diphthong there: I would have
expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YIE</ENAMEX>\?\gert instead.  Where is there a Ph.D.
student, some latter-day <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grimm</ENAMEX>, who will propound
the laws by which our pronunciation is still evolving?
         
         

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Titillating Titles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allison Whitehead</ENAMEX>'s engaging
exploration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">titling</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XX</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>], cautions
against titles that give the game away.  However, it
has been postulated that the best titles are those
that manage to embrace an entire plot (without, of
course, tipping the ending).

            Titles that reveal (without giving away) the are
of the plot are typified, quite randomly, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">by: Witness</ENAMEX>
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Prosecution, Don't Look Now, Beware of Pity</ENAMEX>,
Deliverance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portnoy's Complaint</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crime</ENAMEX> \?\ <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Punishment</ENAMEX>,
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Informer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Doll's House, Hunger, Pygmalion</ENAMEX>,
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ransom</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX>, Before the Fact ,‚Äî
once started, the list is endless.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme</ENAMEX> at this art are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Austen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conrad</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James 'n Wharton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trollope</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX>,... and
there are many, many more of these not so terribly
strange bed-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellows</ENAMEX>.

            Name titles, a category Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitehead</ENAMEX> supports,
present an even greater challenge: to delineate
plot trajectory via. a name.  It can be done.
Think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rebecca</ENAMEX> .  Or try <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hedda Tesman</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parse Cousin</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bette</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Encompass Anna Karenina</ENAMEX> : while not as revelatory
as <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War</ENAMEX> \?\ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace</ENAMEX> , that title is every bit as
sweeping in a related <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arena</ENAMEX>: do not forget that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eponymous</ENAMEX> character departs the book some fifty
pages before it ends, leaving her name as a metaphor
for the deadly effects of society's conventions, as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tolstoy</ENAMEX> saw them, on the soul.  Thus, the title becomes
equally appropriate as an umbrella for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna</ENAMEX>'s
story, its consequences on her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contemporaries</ENAMEX>, and
the novel's preoccupation with the agrarian defection
from that society of (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tolstoy</ENAMEX>'s stand-in) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levin</ENAMEX>.

            Subtitling, also encouraged by Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitehead</ENAMEX>,
can conspire magnificently with a plot-revealing title:
A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Novel Without a Hero</ENAMEX> says it all; Or, The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Modern Prometheus</ENAMEX> tells us what Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelley</ENAMEX> had
in mind; A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tale of the Christ</ENAMEX> prepares us for more
than chariot races, and so on.

            Opening lines of a novel, play, or short story can
also reveal plot schema.

            Punning titles, I would suggest, as titillating as
they may be, have become an editorial addiction of
popular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>.  If they are not fed to us with
restraint, they can soon render us dangerously
overgorged on pop <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX>.




         
         

            When I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> read [in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XX</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BIBLIOGRAPHIA</ENAMEX> that
A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of American Proverbs</ENAMEX> contains data on
the recording of the proverbs and that it contains
historical information on earliest appearances: for
example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Money</ENAMEX> is the root of all evil is traced to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aelfric</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Homilies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c. 1000</ENAMEX>), I assumed that the
original statement, The love of money is the root of
all evil, was not being traced back there.  That,
clearly, would have produced a date nearly a millennium
earlier, for it is a quote from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Testament</ENAMEX>
(I <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6:10</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KJV</ENAMEX>).  I supposed that since
the quote is given as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Money</ENAMEX> is the root of all evil,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX> were tracing back the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> misquotation-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as</NUMEX>-proverb that one usually
hears.

            When, however, I looked up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aelfric</ENAMEX> in The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reader</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Encyclopedia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ben√©t</ENAMEX>) I found:


Aelfric, called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grammaticus</ENAMEX>, or the Grammarian
(<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">c. 955-c</NUMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1020</TIMEX>).  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergyman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX>, a
prolific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> and Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>....
Concerned with the revival of learning, he wrote a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin grammar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> glossary.

            

            Surely, this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> could not have mistranslated Radix
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">malorum est cupiditas</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Money</ENAMEX> is the root of all evil!
He might have translated it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cupidity</ENAMEX> is ...,Avarice
is..., or even The love of money is ..., but
never Money is ...!  The Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cupiditas</ENAMEX> is gitsung avarice, greed, a word not easily
confused with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">feoh cattle</ENAMEX>; property; money.  Having
no copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aelfric's Homilies</ENAMEX> available to me, I am
unable to see exactly what this cleric and grammarian
wrote c. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>, but I will lay you dollars to doughnuts
( low colloq ., ca. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1920</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Partridge</ENAMEX>) that the Grammarian
is not the source of the misquote qua proverb,
Money is the root of all evil.




         
         
            [As far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> quotation is concerned, one
would expect it to be traceable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyndale</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King James Version</ENAMEX>, not scripture of a date nearly a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">millennium earlier</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄîEditor</ENAMEX>]
         
         
            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBUM SAP</ENAMEX>
            
         
         
            To Verb or Not to Verb



            Language, like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, tends to seek the path of
least resistance‚Äînot, I think, because tongues
are naturally indolent, but because their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> are
instinctively efficient.  Nowhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is this human
impulse to simplify and streamline more evident
than in the formation of verbs.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the oldest, tidiest and least ambiguous
methods of verbification is to take a noun and put it
to work, either by adding a prefix or suffix as in simplify
in the paragraph above, or by merely activating
an unadorned and unaffixed substantive, as in streamline .
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Saxons</ENAMEX> wanted a word to express
the activity of traveling in a ship powered by
wind in sails, they saved themselves a lot of breath by
forming the verb sail .  When they wanted to moor
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>, they dropped a heavy object attached to a
line, and they termed this anchoring , because the object
was called an anchor (rather ankor, anker , or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ancre</ENAMEX> ), When it was time to return to terra firma,
they chose a short, appropriate noun to describe that
action, to land .

            Through the easy and logical expedient of converting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nouns</ENAMEX> to verbs, our linguistic forebears established
a tradition that has continued through every
age.  Probably somewhere in the English-speaking
world, a noun was verbified <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>.  And undoubtedly
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it is being greeted with gasps and sputters
of incoherent outrage.

            Why is such a time-tested device viewed with
such utter revulsion?  In an article in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1978 VERBATIM</ENAMEX> [V<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX>  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noel Perrin</ENAMEX> explained the
technical reasons behind the verbification of other
parts of speech‚Äîwhy, for example, we breafkast and
lunch , but do not dinner .  He did not, alas, illuminate
the inexplicable horror with which modern English
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> regard this venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX>.

            What brought the phenomenon to mind was the
recent publication of a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC Style Guide</ENAMEX> for
News and Current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Affairs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Programmes</ENAMEX>.  It was written,
or at least endorsed, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Hall</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managing</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Current Affairs</ENAMEX>, and is for the most part
a reasonable exposition on the need for plain <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
But in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> entitled‚Äîmake that titled‚Äî
Americanisms, the manual betrays both an unseemly
nationalistic bias and an ignorance of the history
of its own language.

            While admitting that some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Americanisms</ENAMEX>, such
as teenager, babysitter, know-how, gimmick, stunt,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">commuter</ENAMEX> , and blurb add vigour and dynamic expression
to the language, the book draws the line at
diaper, drug-store , and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX> (for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
have the patently superior nappy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemist</ENAMEX>'s and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pavement</ENAMEX> ), and at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> habit of turning
nouns into verbs (to hospitalise) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ].

            Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> may be pleased to know that the OED
does not list hospitalise.  On the other hand, he
may be surprised to learn that it does contain hospitalize,
a verb with no stigmatizing labels like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orig</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> slang or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colloq</ENAMEX>.  In fact, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrative</ENAMEX> citations, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1901</TIMEX>, are from
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.

            As is usual with such quasi-official language arbiters,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> guide falls into the deadly snare of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inconsistency</ENAMEX>.  Tut-tutting the fixation of newspaper
sub-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> on short words like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> and
row because they fit in headlines, it adds, somewhat
pompously: These words usually hype the story,
and that is never our job.

            
               Hype ?  Egad, sir!  This one is labeled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>
as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slang</ENAMEX>.  What is more, it is probably a verbified
short-form of hypodermic ( needle ) or hyperbole ,
both of which are nouns!  The next thing we shall
hear is that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> use such
noun-verb abominations as film, record, tape, schedule,
plan, program(me), screen, air, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monitor</ENAMEX> , and
view .

            This erratic neophobia is by no means restricted
to those blessed and sometimes smug beneficiaries
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Received Standard English</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Franklin</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankee</ENAMEX>, returned home after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> to
find an infestation of nefarious noun-verb <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX>, including
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">advocate,</ENAMEX> notice, progress , and oppose .  In a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1789</TIMEX> letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noah Webster</ENAMEX>, he pleaded: If you
should happen to be of my opinion with respect to
these inventions, you will use your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> in reprobating
them.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harper</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</TIMEX> rebuked a government
official for using re-think , and another publication
pilloried the monstrous verb unfreeze in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX>.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1859</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edinburgh Review</ENAMEX> excoriated
another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>, who are [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX>] striving to debase the
language by introducing the verb to wire instead of
the word hitherto used, to telegraph.   That
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>'s puritanical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heirs</ENAMEX> today rail against the verb
fax, even though they likely think nothing of cabling,
telexing , or the dialing and ringing involved in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">telephoning</ENAMEX> .

            Certainly, some verbifications sound sappy.  I
admit I did a double-take when I read that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jersey Nets</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX>, accused of rape, said
his involvement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> never got beyond
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conversating</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> would probably call that
an ignorant back-formation, as it does the useful
and unambiguous enthuse .  But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> provides no
reliable guidance in the whole matter.  It labels the
well-established verb contact , meaning to figuratively
get in touch with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S. Colloq.</ENAMEX>,
even though it has citations going back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1927</TIMEX>.  The
much newer (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1962</TIMEX>) transitive verb access , as of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> base, bears no such oblique opprobrium in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> ,
even though it induces epidemic apoplexy
among the self-appointed sentinels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linguistic correctness</ENAMEX>.

            What are the criteria?  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Safire</ENAMEX> took a futile
stab in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>, opining that when the purpose of
turning a thing into an act is trendy brevity, or chicspeak
[!], the practice is bad style.  He mentioned
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>, to enthuse , to critique , and to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> among
these affectations.  But what has intent to do with
it, even assuming you can accurately impute motive?
I argue that all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safire's</ENAMEX> examples, no matter
how vile the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coiner</ENAMEX>'s design, serve useful purposes.
Certainly, to critique fills a gap left by the pejoration
of criticize , and in any event is not new, having appeared
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1751</TIMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safire</ENAMEX>'s prissy and presumptuous subjectivity is
exemplified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> in the public relations
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Superior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State University</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sault Ste. Marie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Each year since 1976</TIMEX>,
they have published a List of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Words Banished</ENAMEX> from
the Queen's <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> for Mis-use, Over-use or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX>

the continent gleefully and unthinkingly report their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edicts‚Äîwhich</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> included the fairly innocuous
verbs skyrocket and spearhead .  These may be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overused</ENAMEX>, and they are certainly noun-verbs; but
they most decidedly are not non-verbs, as the
LSSU P.R. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> declared.

            So one knee-jerk reaction begets another, and
our peculiar penchant for verbal infanticide‚Äîor infantile
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">verbicide‚Äîcontinues.</ENAMEX>  It is probably bootless
to beseech that the noun-verb nay-sayers withhold
snap judgments at least until a new, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">verb</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> has
been duly usaged.
