            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">toponymy of Rome</ENAMEX> offers an entertaining
supplement to the study of its <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty-seven</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hundred years</TIMEX> of history.  The etymology of the
name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> itself remains a mystery.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Legend</ENAMEX> attributes it to a more or less imaginary eponymous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romulus</ENAMEX> , or, in a less familiar version,
to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Trojan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rhome</ENAMEX> (whose name is a
Greek word for `strength').  Modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> attempt
to explain the name more scientifically as being
based on a word meaning `river,' or on an Etruscan
name.  Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>, noting evidence for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> word ruma meaning `breast,' have concluded
that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> owes its name to the supposed shape of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palatine Hill</ENAMEX> as it appeared to the eye of an exceptionally
determined <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Tetons</ENAMEX>
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American West</ENAMEX> illustrate this same phenomenon
in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.

            Major natural features of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> whose ancient
names are still in use include the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tiber River</ENAMEX> and the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> hills.  The etymology of all these names remains
as elusive as that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">of Rome</ENAMEX> itself.  Various legends
were invented to account for them; for example,
the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitoline Hill</ENAMEX> (from which
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">capitol</ENAMEX> comes) was said to be derived from a human
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> ( caput ) found on it when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jupiter</ENAMEX>
Capitolinus was being built.  This was taken as a portent
of future glory.  The adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palatine Hill</ENAMEX>,
which was eventually reserved for imperial structures
(whence our words palace and palatial ), was
derived from the name of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pallas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evander</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> who according to epic tradition settled on the
site of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> before its ‚Äúreal‚Äù founding.
The fate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pallas</ENAMEX> constitutes a major motif in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vergil</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeneid</ENAMEX> .

            One relatively unfamiliar hill in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte</ENAMEX>
               Testaccio , is a sizable, artificial eminence near the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiber</ENAMEX> south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, rising <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a hundred feet</NUMEX> above
the surrounding level.  This was the commercial
dock area in antiquity, and more recently the site of
the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s slaughterhouse, not much frequented
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, although it is near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX>
that contains the grave of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Keats</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte Testaccio</ENAMEX>
( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Testaceus</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>) means `hill of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">potsherds</ENAMEX>'--an
exact description of its makeup.  For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> it was
formed by the dumping of debris from the dock
area, mostly pieces of broken amphoras, which then
became compacted.  Walking on its surface is an extraordinary
experience.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colosseum</ENAMEX> is the popular name for the most famous
surviving ancient building of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>.  Its official
name was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flavian Amphitheater</ENAMEX> , after the family
name of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builder</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vespasian</ENAMEX>.  The
name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colosseum</ENAMEX> , now usually taken to refer to its
size, originally referred to the fact that the amphitheater
was built adjacent to a huge statue (a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colossus</ENAMEX> )
of the sun god that had been commissioned by
Nero, allegedly in his own likeness.

            The name of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most favored places of
modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piazza Navona</ENAMEX> , is a disguised form of
a word for the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> whose site it occupies,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">circus</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>) built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Domitian</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza Navona</ENAMEX> still preserves the exact
shape of that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX>, of which practically nothing
else is left.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> itself, and the kind of activity
that took place there, were called agon , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
word which originally meant simply `competition,'
but which has given us our word `agony.' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX> Agnes
suffered martyrdom at this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> after her hair
grew with miraculous rapidity to cover the nakedness
by which her persecutors sought to humiliate
her.  Consequently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> that was later built
there was called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúSt</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agnes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Agone</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  The phrase
in agone came to be corrupted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Navona</ENAMEX> , by way of
intermediate forms such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nagone</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navone</ENAMEX> .  Until
well into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the present century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>, if little
used, name of the piazza was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Circo Agonale</ENAMEX> .

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piazza di Spagna</ENAMEX> , site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> Steps, is so
named because since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> it has been
the location of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy See</ENAMEX>.
The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> that leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> Steps, despite
its present concentration of elegant and renowned
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boutiques</ENAMEX>, has the most prosaic of names:
Via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Condotti</ENAMEX> , after the aged conduits that serve the
nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trevi Fountain</ENAMEX>.

            Many ecclesiastical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> have
striking names.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Giovanni</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oleo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stands</ENAMEX> near the
spot, just inside the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porta Latina</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John the Evangelist</ENAMEX> is said to have survived immersion
in boiling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>.  The name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria sopra Minerva</ENAMEX> recalls that it was built over a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> of the pagan <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minerva</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Maria</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cosmedin</ENAMEX> remains an etymological puzzle.  This
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> served <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 8th century</TIMEX>,
and the designation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cosmedin</ENAMEX> is usually assumed
to be connected with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> word kosmidion , diminutive
of kosmos , meaning `embellishment.'

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> names of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> reflect both its long
history and the fanciful imagination of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via del Babuino</ENAMEX> , running north from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza di</ENAMEX>
Spagna, is named after an ancient fountain with a
statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silenus</ENAMEX>, the grotesque drunken <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">follower</ENAMEX> of
Bacchus, which seemed to resemble a baboon.  A
similar circumstance accounts for the strange name
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Santo Stefano del Cacco</ENAMEX> , which refers to a
statue of an animal-headed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deity</ENAMEX> discovered
in the remains of the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Temple of Isis</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> was identified as the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX>
called in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> a macaque , <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">macacco</ENAMEX> , here
colloquially truncated.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Via di Ripetta</ENAMEX> `Embankment
Street' skirts the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tiber River</ENAMEX> as it passes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ara</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pacis and the Mausoleum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Augustus</ENAMEX>.  Here until
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present century</TIMEX> there was a bustling landing
place for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> that plied the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiber</ENAMEX>, a popular
subject in old photographs and prints.  Now a flood
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> has recessed the river below the level
of the adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, and the ripetta has disappeared
except in name.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via di Ripetta</ENAMEX> imperceptibly
merges into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via della Scrofa</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Street of the Sow</ENAMEX>,'
named after another ancient sculpture that is still
preserved there.  Just off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via della Scrofa</ENAMEX> is an old
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tower</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torre della Scimmia</ENAMEX> .  A votive lamp
permanently lit on this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> commemorates the miraculous
rescue of a baby girl from a scimmia `pet
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey'</ENAMEX> that had carried her off to its top.  Its principal
interest for many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, however, is that
this is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hilda</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tower</ENAMEX>, where the ethereal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX> of
Nathaniel <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawthorne</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marble Faun</ENAMEX> lived while she
studied painting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>.

            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> names in the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> recall how <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medieval artisans</ENAMEX> used to congregate
in specialized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarters</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via dei</ENAMEX> Giubbonari
`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> of coats,' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Calderari</ENAMEX> `tinkers,' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pettinari</ENAMEX> `makers
of combs,' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Coronari</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rosary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>,' Balestrari
`<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crossbow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>,' and many others.  The words in
this list are obsolete in contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, but the
street names survive.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> that retains a picturesque name
is Via delle <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Botteghe Oscure</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Street of Dark Shops</ENAMEX>.'
The widening of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> resulted not
only in the brightening (or disappearance) of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, but also in the uncovering of important archaeological
remains, much to the inconvenience of
modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX>--an old story in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>.  The
street gave its name to the influential literary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Botteghe Oscure</ENAMEX> , published there in the 1950s
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marguerite Caetani</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>-born member
of the aristocratic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> whose ancestral palace
stands at the beginning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>.

            The single most prolific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> of street names
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Risorgimento</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> revolutionary
movement that unified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> grew
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenomenally</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the decades</TIMEX> following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Risorgimento</ENAMEX>.
One result of this growth was an abundance
of new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> that needed names; the worthies of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Risorgimento</ENAMEX> largely filled the bill.  Its principal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Vittorio Emanuele II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garibaldi, Mazzini</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cavour</ENAMEX> --are commemorated in the names of
the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and piazzas of virtually every city
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, not least in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>.  Via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venti</ENAMEX> Settembre
`<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">20th of September Street</ENAMEX>' illustrates the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> propensity for naming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> after historic
dates, in this case the date of the breach in the ancient
fortification wall of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, through which Italian
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">troops</ENAMEX> stormed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to bring the Risorgimento
to an end.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via del Plebiscito</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">connects Piazza Venezia</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Largo Argentina</ENAMEX>, now
almost totally surrendered to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxis</ENAMEX>, was
named for the `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plebiscite</ENAMEX>' held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1870</TIMEX>, shortly after
the events of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th of September</TIMEX>, when the people
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> voted to join the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, ending
the temporal power of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>.

            
               Via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veneto</ENAMEX> , site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embassy</ENAMEX> and of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">la</ENAMEX> dolce vita in general, was named for one of the
provinces of the newly unified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, as were other
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> nearby ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Toscana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Lombardia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via</ENAMEX>
Campania, etc .), when what had been the gardens of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villa Ludovisi</ENAMEX> were urbanized almost exactly a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hundred years ago</TIMEX>.  Following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via</ENAMEX>
Veneto was renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Vittoria Veneto</ENAMEX> , after a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Veneto</ENAMEX> that had been the scene of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>
battle of that war.  (This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> itself had been renamed
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1866</TIMEX> in honor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vittorio Emanuele</ENAMEX>
II.)  To this day, hardly anyone ever calls <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Vittorio</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veneto</ENAMEX> anything but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Veneto</ENAMEX>.

            Few of the street names that originated in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fascist</ENAMEX> era have survived it.  The grandiose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dell'Impero</ENAMEX> that was rammed through the central archaeological
zone in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> was named after the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">short-lived Fascist ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>.  It has been
renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via dei Fori Imperiali</ENAMEX> , some what ironically,
as the frenzied traffic on it is a serious blight to the
enjoyment of the remains of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fora</ENAMEX> themselves.  Proposals to demolish this street
and restore the unity of the whole archaeological
zone from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitoline Hill</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colosseum</ENAMEX> are
often in the news.

            Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiber</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via della Conciliazione</ENAMEX> , which
cleared the approach to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Basilica of St. Peter</ENAMEX> from
centuries-old congestion, commemorates the `Reconciliation'
effected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Lateran Treaty</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX>.
This regularized the relationship between the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, which had remained
unsettled during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Risorgimento</ENAMEX>.

            Just inside the southern part of the ancient wall
there is another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> that has escaped renaming,
although it commemorates a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fascist</ENAMEX> victory in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ethiopian</ENAMEX> war.  This is the exotic-sounding
Via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amba Aradam</ENAMEX> , named after a plateau in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ethiopia</ENAMEX>,
a battlefield in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX>.

            In the southern part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> stands the rather
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forlorn EUR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> of obsolescent modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>.
The initials, always pronounced as one Italian
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">word ‚Äúay-OOR‚Äù</ENAMEX>), stand for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esposizione Universale di</ENAMEX>
Roma , a world's fair that was to have been held in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1942</TIMEX> but yielded instead to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, visible from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> that serves
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, is a bizarre structure officially called
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo della Civilt√° del Lavoro</ENAMEX>.  Its principal design
feature is the rounded openings that cover all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of
its exterior walls.  The major <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> guidebook to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> soberly claims that this building has been
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nicknamed Il Colosseo Quadrato</ENAMEX> , `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Square Colosseum</ENAMEX>.'
In fact, what most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> really call it is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Il</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palazzo di Groviera</ENAMEX> `The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swiss Cheese Palace</ENAMEX>.'

            A scattering of names referring to more recent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> history can be found.  At the base of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aventine</ENAMEX>,
a postwar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> has been named the Parco
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">della Resistenza dell'Otto Settembre</ENAMEX> , commemorating
the heroic action against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazis</ENAMEX> there on that
date in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partisans</ENAMEX>.  Nearby, just
outside the ancient wall, the area in front of the railroad
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">station</ENAMEX> has been named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazzale dei Partigiani</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luigi Einaudi</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patriarch</ENAMEX> of postwar <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> politics,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948 to 1955</TIMEX>,
when he was an octogenarian, has the unusual honor
of a street named for him in the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>,
near the central railway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>.  This had previously
been called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Viale delle Terme</ENAMEX>, after the ruins of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adjacent Baths</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diocletian</ENAMEX>, one corner of which
holds the present <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Museum of Antiquities</ENAMEX>.

            Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> who visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> should make
an excursion to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villa Borghese</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> just outside
the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Veneto</ENAMEX>, where they will
find what used to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viale dei Leoni</ENAMEX> `Street of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lions</ENAMEX>,' now officially <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viale Fiorello Laguardia</ENAMEX> .

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>.  There were, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
bishops at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council of Arles</ENAMEX>, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">314</NUMEX>.  See The

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Scandalous Yiddish</ENAMEX>
Guide of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census Bureau</ENAMEX>




            Every language deserves respect and reverence.
Every language is the creative expression of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, the collective repository of
a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s legends, traditions, and history, and a
mighty potentiator of its national and cultural continuity.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census Bureau</ENAMEX> publishes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> foreign language
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guides</ENAMEX>, from (alphabetically) <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>,
to assist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> unfamiliar with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> in
answering the official <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Census Form</ENAMEX>.  I
took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish Guide</ENAMEX> and my
eyes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-score-and-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years old</TIMEX>, glazed over, not
because of their age but because what they saw was
totally unreadable--a heap of pure gibberish.  From
the very title of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide</ENAMEX> , to the first word, first
sentence, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> paragraph--every rule of spelling,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grammar</ENAMEX>, and syntax has been violated beyond recognition.
The entire document represents a veritable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rain</ENAMEX> of error--nay, a torrent, a deluge of gross
mistakes, outrageous misspellings, and just plain and
simple ignorance.

            To give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> an approximate idea of what
a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> is confronted with, imagine a
question like ‚ÄúHow many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> live in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX>?‚Äù
being translated as With <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pensil</ENAMEX> say on these line how
much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">parssonalitys residue</ENAMEX> in yuore abodiement .
Even this fails to convey in full the nonsense of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yiddish Guide</ENAMEX> because with patience and some educated
guessing one could decipher the meaning of
the above sentence.  This, however, would be practically
impossible with the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide</ENAMEX> .  No
amount of patient effort and guessing to reconstruct
a sentence would be of any avail because the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide</ENAMEX> is garbled to the point of incoherence.

            One is reminded of the assembly instructions
that used to come with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> imported from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> terms in those instructions were so
comically outlandish and the sentence <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> so
awkward that they became a source of hilarity.
There is nothing hilarious or mirthful, however,
about the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish Guide</ENAMEX> .  To the very contrary: it
brings forth a deep sense of sadness because what
was supposed to be a serious attempt at facilitating
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census</ENAMEX> count, a sort of ‚Äúfirst aid‚Äù assistance in
answering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census Form</ENAMEX>, looks like the work of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> who took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> pages from a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> book,
cut them up with his plastic scissors into tiny pieces
of various shapes and sizes and then playfully pasted
them together.

            How did such irresponsibility come about?
Why did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census Bureau</ENAMEX> not call up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> for a referral to a responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX>?  Instead, I imagine, whoever was in
charge of foreign language translations asked around
casually during a coffee break: <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">‚ÄúAnyone</ENAMEX> here know
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish?‚</ENAMEX>Äù  And a chap piped up: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúWell</ENAMEX>, my mother
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> spoke <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> when they didn't want me
and my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> to understand what they were saying,
but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> always spoke
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish...‚</ENAMEX>Äù

            The saying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traduttore traditore</ENAMEX> expresses the
idea that no matter how gifted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX> is, he can
never truly convey the subtle nuances and meanings
behind the original language, the many-layered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>
and allusions that the words in the original
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">connote</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish ‚Äútranslator‚Äù</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide</ENAMEX> doesn't belong, of course, to the above class
of translators.  While professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translators</ENAMEX> are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">richly</ENAMEX> and deeply knowledgable in both languages,
the original language and the language they translate
into, the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census Guide</ENAMEX>
is totally ignorant of the rudimentary rules of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>,
not to mention its spirit.  The end result of his
work therefore is tantamount to sabotage, albeit unintended,
since any native <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> starting
to answer the questionnaire with the help of this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide</ENAMEX> would soon have to discard, in utter confusion,
both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census Form</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide</ENAMEX> as well.

            But this denigration alone would not make the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yiddish Guide</ENAMEX> the travesty it is.  What made it a travesty,
indeed a tragedy, is that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> upon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>, many of them elderly and
poor, remained uncounted, and thus have fallen
‚Äúbetween the cracks,‚Äù so to speak, with grave political,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX>, and economic consequences.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnhart</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> have
been intimately involved in dictionary-making, certainly
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most unusual family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> one
could imagine.  The tradition began with the influential
work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarence L. Barnhart</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dean</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
lexicography, who at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 89</TIMEX> is still active in
the profession.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.L.B.</ENAMEX> had much to do with the application
of modern linguistic theory to lexicography;
the list of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> he has edited includes
such landmarks as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of American English</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago Press</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thorndike</ENAMEX>-Barnhart
School <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictionaries</ENAMEX> series (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Foresman</ENAMEX>;
the top-selling school dictionaries in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>), the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American College Dictionary</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>), the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Century Cyclopedia</ENAMEX> of Names (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appleton-Century-Crofts</ENAMEX>),
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">World Book Dictionary</ENAMEX> (little
known, sadly, but one of the best unabridged dictionaries
still being kept current).  He also founded
and, with his son, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX>, still edits the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Barnhart Dictionary</ENAMEX>
Companion [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDC</ENAMEX> ], a periodical report on
new words that features the staple of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barnhart</ENAMEX> lexicography--full,
dated citations.

            In addition to their work in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary Companion</ENAMEX> ,
well regarded by lexicographers and other
serious word <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, the family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Barnhart</ENAMEX> and their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have directed much effort over the years
to tracking and recording new <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, and this latest
publication is another in that line.  This Third
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Barnhart Dictionary of New English</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBDNE</ENAMEX>] follows
on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> others of similar purpose and style that appeared
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973 and 1980</TIMEX>, respectively, published
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harper</ENAMEX> & Row.  The intent of the series is to record
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúwords</ENAMEX> and meanings not entered or fully explained
in standard dictionaries... a supplement to
current dictionaries of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">language‚Äù</ENAMEX> (from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preface</ENAMEX>).  In this latest addition to the series
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert K. Barnhart</ENAMEX> is listed first on the title page,
taking over his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s role in the previous books,
and, as before, they are joined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sol Steinmetz</ENAMEX>.
The combined editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> books includes
the names of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no fewer than nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Barnharts</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBDNE</ENAMEX> is an amalgamation and continuation,
with ‚Äúmany of the entries found in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> earlier
books of this <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">series</ENAMEX> (both now out of print)...included
to provide a revised and expanded record of
new words and meanings introduced into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three decades‚Äù</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preface</ENAMEX>).  Those
wishing to supplement their aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s Third
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New International</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merriam</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX>) and unwilling to
spend about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> dollars more for the recent editions
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Unabridged</ENAMEX> or World
Book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX> would be very well served by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBDNE</ENAMEX> .  It should be noted, however, that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBDNE</ENAMEX> , in including the work of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX>,
represents a departure from their approach.  The
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> was totally independent of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX>
book: the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> supplemented the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>.  The
TBDNE consolidates the best of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> earlier dictionaries,
with revisions, then adds some new entries.
It is intended to replace its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX>, not
supplement them.

            Each entry contains a definition (occasionally
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more) followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more lengthy,
dated citations, plus a date, often different, of the
earliest citation on file for each sense.  The date is
often earlier than that of the citations given since
these were selected from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barnhart</ENAMEX> files as most
illustrative of meaning and usage.  Indeed, the definition
is often provided in the citation itself.  Multiple
citations are arranged in an order of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>'
choosing, not necessarily chronological.  This approach
reflects editorial sifting of the evidence from
the citations and a subsequent presentation that best
befits clarity and sense development.  Strict chronological
presentation of dated citations is at best a lexicographic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Procrustean</ENAMEX> bed, at worst very misleading.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Citations</ENAMEX>, being only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lexicographer</ENAMEX>'s raw
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, need to be carefully reviewed, weighed, selected,
and presented if a dictionary entry is to record
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of a word properly.  Sound citation
analysis is, like good definition-writing, a rare gift,
and requires, besides diligence, broad experience
and a firm sense of the idiom of the language:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sprachgef√ºhl .</ENAMEX>  Fortunately, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of TBDNE
have this in abundance, and the resulting excellence
is manifest on every page.

            A careful estimate indicates that the TBDNE
contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 9,000 headwords</NUMEX> with an additional
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000 or so</NUMEX> other entry words; of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,000 or so</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entries</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some 2,300</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 21%</NUMEX>) are phrasal.  The
estimate suggests something less than the entry
count of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merriam-Webster 12,000 Words</ENAMEX> , which
is billed as a supplement to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merriam Third</ENAMEX> , but
there the comparison ends.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBDNE</ENAMEX> has well
over twice the information of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merriam</ENAMEX> book,
which lacks citations.  Citations are particularly important
in dictionaries of new words, not only in establishing
a dated record, but to furnish context and
thereby more clearly illustrate actual use--essential
for words that are by nature unfamiliar.

            Other features include special notes on usage,
word formation, and cultural or historical background.
Pronunciations are given as necessary, using
an adaptation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Phonetic Alphabet</ENAMEX>
developed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barnharts</ENAMEX> for this series.
Etymologies are provided for a small proportion of
entries.  Otherwise, the dictionary presents itself in
fairly standard, familiar fashion, with the sort of labeling
and cross-referencing that one expects in a
quality product.  One feature of the earlier books in
the series has unfortunately not been kept in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBDNE</ENAMEX> --the use of centered dots within headwords
to show syllabication points.

            An analysis of the entries in two randomly selected
spans of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBDNE</ENAMEX> suggests that the great
bulk of the entries are repeated, often with revision,
from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> earlier books, with less evidence of
new material than one might have hoped for.  A randomly
chosen span of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> full entries in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBDNE</ENAMEX> ,
from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pill</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">platinum</ENAMEX> , was compared against the
same alphabetic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">span</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963 and 1980</TIMEX> dictionaries:


<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1963        1980        1990</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> entries  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> entries  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> entries

            

            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> entries of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBDNE</ENAMEX> include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> from
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX> book (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> were dropped) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> from the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> book (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> were dropped), with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> completely
new entries.  The new items, pinstriper and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Planet X</ENAMEX>, are, not surprisingly, both drawn from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDC</ENAMEX> , which provided the actual citation for pinstriper
and the date of earliest occurrence for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Planet</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX>  It seems likely that the increasingly common acronym
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIN</ENAMEX> , for personal identification number , issued
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> as a unique identifier for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> who
use automatic teller machines (yes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX> is in),
which was in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDC</ENAMEX> was passed over for TBDNE because
it appears as an entry in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unabridged Second Edition</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>), though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX> is
an entry in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>.

            To find such a low proportion of new entries
(<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>), was unexpected, so another random span of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>, from go to grammaticality , was compared, with
the following result:


<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1963        1980        1990</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> entries  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> entries  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> entries

            

            Of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> entries, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> come from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX>
book (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> dropped), all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> were taken from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>,
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> new items were added: goldbug , golden parachute,
gold rush (new sense), golf ball (new sense),
and gomer .  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> are to be found in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDC</ENAMEX> , while entries for all appear in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Book</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> edition), also produced by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barnhart</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>.  So there was indeed a greater proportion
of new entries (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>) than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">span</ENAMEX> noted
first, but still a disappointingly small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minority</ENAMEX> of the
whole.

            Of the entries left out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBDNE</ENAMEX> that did
appear in the previous books, none was surprising.
Technical terms such as pinealectomy , planetology ,
and planktotrophic are of low frequency or have only
specialized use, so were understandably dropped in
compiling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBDNE</ENAMEX> (indeed, it is more notable
that they were ever included at all).  Entries for pipe
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bomb</ENAMEX> , ( in the ) pipeline, pita , and placebo effect ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">plasma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX> , and platform tennis , all in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX> book,
were doubtless dropped because they all are entered
in current general-language dictionaries, and
so are no longer required in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBDNE</ENAMEX>, given its
stated intention.  The dropping of goulash communism
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX> citation; economic approach in thencommunist
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> emphasizing greater production
of consumer goods) and gramadan (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX> citation;
Hindi loanword applied to a Gandhian form of
land collectivization in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>), both in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX> book
but not in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBDNE</ENAMEX> , reflects the fact that, in a living
language, citations require different analysis and
judgment after the perspective of time is added.  It
may seem unfortunate to discard entries that, no
matter the frequency or currency of the term, are
part of the record of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, but such is necessary in
any commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictionary venture</ENAMEX>.  At least it does
appear, based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spans</ENAMEX> analyzed, that the discards
were judiciously chosen.

            A comparison reading of full entries in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBDNE</ENAMEX> against the source entries from its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX>
reveals the marks of close editing to incorporate
better citations and record <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> attestations.  Also,
the citational style has been tightened, undoubtedly
to create space for additional entries.  Where the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963 and 1980</TIMEX> dictionaries cited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, article,
publication, and date (for a periodical), the same citation
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBDNE</ENAMEX> gives only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> and date.
The space saved allowed for amalgamation and new
entries; yet, anyone interested in more background
on a particular citation is provided with enough information
to track it down, assuming that a good library
is at hand.

            I hesitate to quibble over a few items not found
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBDNE</ENAMEX> , since even these should cause no
great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>.  A dictionary of neologisms owes
nearly everything to the citation files behind it, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">citation</ENAMEX> files are very much a product of accident,
constrained by budget.  That the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX> Unabridged
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Edition</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>) includes pimpmobile
and plain-vanilla probably means that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX> files had citations for these, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barnharts</ENAMEX>' not--or not enough.  Given the immense
quantity of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in use worldwide, it is simply
impossible for any single citation-gathering force to
see, much less collect, all that should be in the file.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merriam</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Words</ENAMEX> has entries for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinteresque</ENAMEX>,
pistou , and place value , again a reflection of what the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vast Merriam</ENAMEX> files have yielded up.  Still, none of the
new-words dictionaries I checked, including the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman Register of New Words</ENAMEX> (edited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayto; Longman</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Facts on File Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Words</ENAMEX> (edited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LeMay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lerner</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor; Facts on File</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>) had an entry for pixelization
`the appearance of pixels (dots that make up
a computer-screen image) in a computer graphic, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mark</ENAMEX> of lower resolution.'  An entry for it must await
citations entering the files, assuming the word
proves its usefulness to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of English over time.

            It is a bit dissatisfying to find fewer new entries
in the TBDNE than one might have expected.  Commercial
constraints are the likely explanation for
this, not, I strongly suspect, lack of new words and
senses in the ever-burgeoning <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> lexicon.  But
we should not judge too harshly on the basis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spans</ENAMEX> covering <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 1%</NUMEX> of the entries.
While it can truly be said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBDNE</ENAMEX> shows
more of the solid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX> than
it does of newly laid work, this is hardly negative
criticism.  The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963 and 1980</TIMEX> books are both fine
dictionaries, and a book that combines the best of
those, carefully re-edited, with some solid, new lexicography
based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDC</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">World Book Dictionary</ENAMEX> ,
and the substantial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barnhart</ENAMEX> files, must be a
high-quality dictionary.  It is.

            I'd like to add a word to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Cohen</ENAMEX>'s delightful
list in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúJingo Lingo‚</ENAMEX>Äù [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>].  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> words
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junkie</ENAMEX> are toxoman and morphinman , neither of
which merits <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> use.





         
         


            I must take issue with your quick dismissal of
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saussy</ENAMEX>'s claim that his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> earned his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bachelor</ENAMEX>'s
degree ‚Äúat the behest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps‚</ENAMEX>Äù
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>].  To the extent that written orders constitute
military commands, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Navy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Corps</ENAMEX> do indeed issue ‚Äúbehests‚Äù for academic degrees.
In the past, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> has had programs
similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College Degree Program</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDP</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy Enlisted Scientific Education Program</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NESEP</ENAMEX>).  Moreover, at any given time there
are many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> enrolled in graduate
study programs at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naval Postgraduate School</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPS</ENAMEX>), in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monterey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>.  They arrive at NPS
with orders in hand and usually complete degree requirements
within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>--at the behest of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX>.





         
         
            To <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbrev</ENAMEX>. or Not to Abbreviate



            There is a linguistic process in the evolution of
our vocabulary that is not functioning with a
high rate of efficiency.  Not that the language has
ever been highly logical or ever should be, but what
set out on a bon voyage is gradually abandoning ship
and heading back to shore.  What was to have happened
simply is not always happening.

            In the world of modern communication, it is evident
that it is often necessary to speed up the sending
of messages.  With the written language, this is
orthographically facilitated by the various processes
of word shortening--acronyms ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZIP for Zone Improvement</ENAMEX>
Plan ), contractions ( won't for will not ),
clipped words ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">deli</ENAMEX> for delicatessen ) and abbreviations
( lb. for pound ).  However, the time- and space-saving
act of abbreviating is not always working with
the efficiency that was originally intended.  A few
examples will vividly illustrate this puzzling discrepancy.

            When we find ourselves with a long word or
phrase on our hands, we would normally expect to
find an abbreviation to come to the rescue.  In time,
that generally happens and, with few communication
difficulties, everything lives happily after.  The
expression, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of the ceremonies , is earliest
found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1662</TIMEX>.  It is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a hundred years later</TIMEX>
before an efficient abbreviation for it is found.  In
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">1790 M.C.</ENAMEX> finally arrives in print to reduce the writing
wordload by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">300 percent</NUMEX>.  Supposedly, everything
is firmly set.  For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost one and one half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.C.</ENAMEX> does the job it was called upon to do.  In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX>, however, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> mysteriously decides
that a new word is needed to represent the pronunciation
of the abbreviation.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emcee</ENAMEX> is thus born, no
matter that this represents an increase from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> letters
to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>, a bulging <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">125%</NUMEX> growth.  Granted, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emcee</ENAMEX>
is still more efficient than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of ceremonies , but
the need for spelling out the sound of letters seems
redundant, superfluous, and therefore useless.

            Nevertheless, the practice of changing from
term to abbreviation to phonetic spelling of the abbreviation
is an old and continuing oddity in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, the need for a general-purpose vehicle
was satisfied with the development of a means
of transportation referred to by the government
with astonishing directness and candor as a general-purpose
vehicle .  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX>, quick to abbreviate everything,
began to refer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> as a g.p., but
by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941</TIMEX> g.p. had given way to the longer jeep .

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice president</ENAMEX> (with no <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> found in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1574</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> , referring to his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> nibs,
is found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1787</TIMEX>.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sometime later</TIMEX> VP shortened the
term by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">250%</NUMEX>, but by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX> veep , although abhorred
by many, was applied affectionately to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alben Barclay</ENAMEX>
and became part of the written and spoken
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vocabulary</ENAMEX>.

            
               Junior varsity is found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>, referring to the
secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>.
The date for the first use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.V.</ENAMEX> is unsure, but the
date for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">jayvee , 1937</TIMEX>, would seem to show a lack of
conclusive evidence since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junior varsity</ENAMEX> must obviously
have preceded jayvee .

            
               Disc jockey is found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941</TIMEX>, deejay in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>,
indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.J.</ENAMEX> might have been in between.

            Another inconsistency is to be found in the process
of knockout , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">boxing</ENAMEX> term and later the metaphoric
term referring to anything that amazes or
shocks.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knockout</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> recorded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1887</TIMEX>, and logically
following is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.O.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</TIMEX>, but the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appearance
of kayo is cited in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1923</TIMEX>.

            Not to rehash the OK controversy, but oll korrect
is <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1839</TIMEX> with OK also listed in that
same year.  Following reasonable suit, okeh appears
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1919</TIMEX>, and okay is charted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> of the armed forces is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Construction</ENAMEX>
Batallion, which was quickly abbreviated
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.B.</ENAMEX>  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1942</TIMEX> this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> came to be known as the
Seabees , sporting uniforms with an appropriate insigne
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">seafaring bee</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the latest words to enter the Abbreviation
Cycle of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redundancy Race</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> .  The
‚ÄúShow-Me‚Äù state gained statehood in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1821</TIMEX>.  It is not
clear when the inept <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mo.</ENAMEX> became the official abbreviation.
However it is, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> saw fit to
continue the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MO.</ENAMEX>  The final stage is now
evident in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s motto regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúMO</ENAMEX>
SAYS NO TO <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DRUGS</ENAMEX>,‚Äù where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX> is obviously to be
rhymed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NO.</ENAMEX>

            What are the reasons for the apparent senselessness
in the preceding examples?  It must first be remembered
that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> is not highly reliant on the
rules of logic.  Prescriptive dictionaries are becoming
fewer; descriptive dictionaries are gaining in
popularity.  Aside from generalizations, however,
the abbreviations considered here do present some
reason for their madness.  Mo rhyming with no certainly
makes the slogan easy to remember.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeep</ENAMEX> and
veep , each containing only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> syllable, are easier to
pronounce than their ancestral abbreviations.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Emcee</ENAMEX>
probably radiates a more euphemistic aura of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dignity than M.C.</ENAMEX>  Although there seems to be no
reason for jayvee , it must be noted that the date
given for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appearance of a word is actually a
record of when it was first found in print, and earlier
oral use could not distinguish <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. V.</ENAMEX> from jayvee .  The
word was no doubt used orally much earlier.

            The problem with abbreviations as presented
here again illustrates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> demand that language
work the way they want to make it work.
Overall, the abbreviating process is alive and doing
exceptionally well.
         
         

            To supplement <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. T. Henry</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúNifty Nomenclature‚</ENAMEX>Äù
[XVI<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX>], my <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> (nee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hume</ENAMEX> ) from

            Perhaps the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> was not serious, because he
had a plural subject with a singular verb, runneth , in
the relative clause.  What ‚Äúrunneth not to the contrary‚Äù
is memory, rather than custom.  A better use
of the phrase would be:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Droit du</ENAMEX> seigneur has been the custom for so long
that the mind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> runneth not to the contrary.

            





         
         
            The Sounds of Inglish



            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Shaw</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry Higgins</ENAMEX> liked to
vent his ire on his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">countrymen</ENAMEX> for ‚Äúthe
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cold-blooded</ENAMEX> murder of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> tongue.‚Äù  What
his views were on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> who spoke the language
less than perfectly we shall never know.  But I
imagine those views wouldn't have been complimentary
either, because many of his real-life <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>,
devout worshipers of the Queen's <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>,
have expressed varying degrees of horror on the
subject.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> would have thought that a little gratitude
would be in order, gratitude for living in a world
that largely speaks their language, however differently.
Assume for a moment that this were not the
case.  How would the predominantly monoglot
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britons</ENAMEX> then cope?

            Now imagine for a moment that you are seated
on the verandah of a bungalow in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>.  The impending
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">monsoon</ENAMEX> has darkened the skies, the breeze
is rustling the chintz curtains and the calico tablecloth.
Is a typhoon on its way?  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motley crowd</ENAMEX> is
hurrying by--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">dungarees</TIMEX>; a yogi with his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX>; a noblewoman in purdah in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">palanquin</TIMEX>; a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of nautch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>, attractive in their aniline-dyed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dresses</ENAMEX> and bright bandanas, their bangles jingling
and their long, shampooed hair streaming in the
breeze; a sepoy all smart in khaki on his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>, his
jodhpurs trim and neat; a scholarly pundit; a mahout
on his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX>, ambling like a juggernaut.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pariah</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog barks</ENAMEX> at a bandicoot (or is it a mongoose?) in the
paddy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> while mynahs twitter in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">adjoining</NUMEX>
jungle.  Fishermen secure their catamarans and dinghies
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX> with thick coir ropes.  There's
have a dekko at.  Everything is so different from
good old Blighty...

            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Thirty-five</NUMEX> words in the preceding paragraph
are derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> languages and are listed in
standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> dictionaries as acceptable English
words.  Some of them strike us immediately as exotic
but others (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">shampoo</ENAMEX>, for instance) are in such common
use that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are often astonished to learn
that they have a foreign origin.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX> carried
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language to distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">climes</ENAMEX>.  These lands
were poles apart from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> in every possible
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>.  There simply were no words in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
language to describe many local features and the local
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> of life.  New words, phrases, and idioms had
to be coined--out of necessity.  What better than to
borrow words and expressions from local languages
and anglicize them?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, in turn, made its impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> languages
in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways: crossbreeding with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
words to produce unique amalgamations; and lending
words and expressions to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> languages.  As a
result, we now have hybrid words like gymkhana
and memsahib .  Gymkhana , a `<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">socialize</ENAMEX> and partake in sports and recreation,' is a
mixture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> gendkhana (meaning `ball
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX>') and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> gymnasium .  Memsahib ,
meaning `<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> or white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>,' stems from sahib ,
an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> title of respect often accorded to white
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, and mem , a corruption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madam</ENAMEX> .

            So too, words like shirt, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>, paper, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX>, road ,
and light have become common in everyday vernacular
speech in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>.  Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pronunciations</ENAMEX> have
been <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Indianized</ENAMEX>.  Pen is at times pronounced ‚Äúpenai‚Äù
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South India</ENAMEX>, and when somebody speaks of
krishnoil , he means kerosene <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>.  Expressions like
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tamil Then-nilavu</ENAMEX> , which is a literal translation
of `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX>' and `moon' and means `honeymoon,' have
also resulted.

            The permutations do not end there.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>
bring nuances from their own languages into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
This has resulted in a variant of English known
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inglish</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian English</ENAMEX>).  <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Inglish</ENAMEX> differs from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> ways: words, expressions, grammar, pronunciation
and rhythm.  Inglish sentences are peppered
with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> words.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yaar</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Da</ENAMEX> (meaning
`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chum</ENAMEX>' or `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddy</ENAMEX>'), often punctuate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Inglish</ENAMEX> speech.
Maha , meaning `great,' is another such word; an
irate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> chastises his `maha-lazy‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">enamoured</ENAMEX> youth woos his ‚Äúmaha-beautiful‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sweetheart</ENAMEX>.
When the police control unruly mobs by
wielding wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">batons</ENAMEX> (lathi in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hindi</ENAMEX>), they make
a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äúlathi-</NUMEX>charge.‚Äù  When you are introduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>'s
‚Äúco-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>,‚Äù you infer that he is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gentleman</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> patterns of grammer are also adopted in
Inglish speech.  ‚ÄúWill you come?‚Äù changes to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúYou
will come?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhy has she done this?‚Äù to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúWhat
for she has done this?‚Äù because that's the right way
to structure those sentences grammatically in the
original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> languages.  Somebody answering the
telephone might be expected to say, ‚ÄúThis is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krishnaswami speaking</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Instead</ENAMEX>, you get a booming,‚Äù
‚ÄúI speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krishnaswami</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            The lilting rhythms and pronunciations of each
regional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> language are characteristic of the Inglish
spoken there.  Thus, we have <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inglish</ENAMEX> dialects
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hinglish, Benglish, Punglish, Tamglish</ENAMEX>,
Malayanglish, and so forth.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inglish</ENAMEX> often
tells you which region of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> he or she hails from.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúTwinkle Twinkle Little Star‚</ENAMEX>Äù sung by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North Indian</ENAMEX>
could have the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">le</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">twinkle pronounced ‚Äúlay</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andhra Pradesh</ENAMEX> might come up with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telugu flavored Twinkulu Twinkulu Littlu Staru</ENAMEX> ,
while from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Kerala</ENAMEX> come the deeply resonant Malayalam
twangs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dwingle Dwingle Liddle Sdar</ENAMEX> .‚Äù

            And <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Inglish</ENAMEX> speech is not complete without
nodding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, some gesticulation, and an expressive
face.

            This may be more than sufficient, perhaps, to
drive the literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purists</ENAMEX> to suicide.  But before they
plunge the knife in, let them consider the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
spoken in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> around the world--<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, and especially
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States of America</ENAMEX>.  A majority of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> today as it should not be spoken
according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purists</ENAMEX>.

            Languages that rigidly hold on to their purity
soon suffocate themselves.  Those that adapt and
change (and yes, get ‚<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Äúcorrupted‚Äù</ENAMEX> once in a while)
survive and thrive.  It is this quality to adapt that
gives English its virility.  Its status as the most widely
spoken language in the world will take some challenging.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speakers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, this is reason enough
to rejoice.  Listen with an attentive ear to the sounds
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inglish</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Englishes</ENAMEX> of other lands.  The experience
can be maha-fascinating.
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Naming of Poisons</ENAMEX>



            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúIt</ENAMEX> must be tough being a bartender,‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>
would sometimes say to me, in the days
when I was practising the trade.  ‚ÄúHow can you
ever remember all those different drink recipes?‚Äù  It
is not really all that hard, I would explain to them.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Drinks</ENAMEX> are a lot like popular songs.  First, there are
the standards , like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martini</ENAMEX> and the Screwdriver
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloody Mary</ENAMEX> .  These are to bartender what
White <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">My Way</ENAMEX> are to a lounge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX>.
There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 20 or 30</NUMEX> of them, and they account
for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> of all cocktail orders.

            Then there are the current hits , things like the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melonball</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamikaze</ENAMEX> .  These are comparable
to this season's hit songs.  If you don't know how to
make one of them, someone can usually tell you--
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> who ordered it, a regular sitting at the
end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, or another bartender.  After this happens
a few times the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX> gets pounded into your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, like the latest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Springsteen</ENAMEX> on the juke
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">box.</ENAMEX>

            Finally, there are the oldies-but-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">goodies</ENAMEX> .  If you
don't know these, you can look them up in one of
the bartending reference books behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>.

            There is also--with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> as well as with
songs--a phenomenally large number of also-rans.
One can look through the promotional booklets
given out by the liquor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and the ads in
magazines like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playboy</ENAMEX> to find countless unlikely
sounding recipes concocted by marketing departments
in hopes of selling more of their products.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> rarely hears a ‚Äúreal‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> order one of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>.

            If one adds to these flops the unpublicized creations
of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bartenders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>,
it is apparent that in our culture there is an
immense and continual outpouring of mixologic creativity.
Only the tiniest fraction of this output, however,
actually achieves the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> level of popular acceptance,
and becomes a current hit .  Having
reached that level, it is almost as difficult to achieve
the next <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and become a standard , a drink that
will still be popular by the time the next generation
of current hits comes along.

            I occasionally wondered why, out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> available, a certain few drinks
had managed to achieve favor with the popular
taste.  It was usually not , as one might have supposed,
because a newly discovered combination of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ingredients</ENAMEX> had resulted in some completely unique
new flavor.  An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama Slammer</ENAMEX> , for instance, is
made from sweetish liquors and fruit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX>.  As far as
flavor goes, it offers nothing to the palate that could
not as easily be provided by, say, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore Sling</ENAMEX> .
But, for young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> of certain backgrounds,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama Slammer</ENAMEX> is now chic, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sling</ENAMEX> is not.

            The liquor industry sometimes does come up
with new and different flavors.  During the period
when I was tending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, for instance, a honeydewmelon-flavored
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">liqueur</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Midori</ENAMEX>, a product of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">distiller</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suntory</ENAMEX>, became very popular.
But one might still ask why certain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Midori</ENAMEX>-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melonball</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearl Harbor</ENAMEX> ,
became widely accepted, while others-- The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Green</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goddess</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Early Spring</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> --languished in the
pages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suntory</ENAMEX>'s promotional literature.  I have
concluded that by far the most important factor in
the success of a new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX> is its name .

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> where I used to work was located in the
train <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New London</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>.  This is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> that has both a large naval <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> and a private
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-educational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX>, and I waited on great numbers
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in their early to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid twenties</TIMEX>.  This is
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that, more than any other, serves as the
breeding ground for new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>.  Very often I would
take an order for a drink that was just coming into
popularity, and then, when I served the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX>, I
would find out that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> had expected
something different.  Frequently that was because
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> came from a region of the country
where a different set of ingredients went by the
same name.  What had happened was that the recipe
had become garbled as it traveled across the country
by oral transmission from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> to bartender,
and bartender to bartender.  Yet the name had survived.

            Unlike most products, which may be slipped
across a counter (over or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">under</NUMEX>) in silence, drinks
are usually ordered out loud.  Young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, when
ordering a drink, like to give an indication, to themselves
and to others, that they are tough, or sexy, or
funny.  They also have a strong tendency to imitate
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> and to order what they hear other order.
During the time that I was working as a bartender
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977-1984</TIMEX>), the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> that became
popular almost invariably contained references in
their names to images from the following categories:
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) pleasant taste; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) destruction or self-destruction;
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) irreverence; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) sexual innuendo.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pleasant Taste</ENAMEX> : Many young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do not
like the taste of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquor</ENAMEX> in its raw state.  They often
order a drink with a name that seems to promise a
sweet or non-alcoholic taste.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúA Creamsicle</ENAMEX> !?  That
sounds good!  I think I'll try one of those!‚Äù  In all of
the cases below, the name actually does reflect, to
some extent, the taste of the drink.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Destruction</ENAMEX> or Self-Destruction : It is not always
clear which of these is referred to in the name
of a drink.  When someone orders a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cherry Bomb</ENAMEX> ,
for instance, is he saying, symbolically, that he is
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> to drop a small explosive charge into his nervous
system?  Or is he saying that he is explosive?
Perhaps it is a little of each.  There are many drinks
in this category, as one might expect, since so many
of the euphemisms for drunk (smashed, bombed , etc.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>) also refer to destruction:

overlap a good deal.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> Motherfucker
could also be placed in the next category, but I think
the name is intended more for shock than anything
else.  It is a way of saying, ‚ÄúI am an outlaw, a mountain
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">man!‚</ENAMEX>Äù  As one might expect, it tastes like a syrupy

the references are increasingly blunt.  Much of the

hard to imagine someone buying the ingredients for
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Orgasm</ENAMEX> at a liquor store and then going home and
mixing up a few to drink while reading mysteries in

            There is no doubt that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> names often provide
a source of amusement, and some well-known

            Can you Find It?
            This might (otherwise) be a fine piece of work,
but I happened to open it to the question, ‚ÄúThe

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">knothead</ENAMEX>...' ‚Äù For those who have not remained
awake during class, I must repeat the fact that when
a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>, whether it be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Slang</ENAMEX> (the source of this citation), or any
other work uses quotations it simply lists the quotation
as the earliest printed evidence found of the use
of a word: that does NOT mean that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of the
cited work made up the word.  Just think how many
words must have been coined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> whose
works are the only ones extant from early periods of
the language: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who misuse citation dictionaries
must think that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Rolle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hampole, Holinshed</ENAMEX>,
Chaucer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>, and a handful of other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">geniuses</ENAMEX> sat down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> and invented the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
language, making up the words as they went along.
This book has a lot of cartoons and very few words.
Its cover promises the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> will be able to answer
questions like ‚ÄúWhy did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whoopi Goldberg</ENAMEX> once
work at a mortuary, and what did she do there?‚Äù and
‚ÄúHow many paintings did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Gogh</ENAMEX> actually sell
during his lifetime?‚Äù  If you regard life as a trivial
pursuit, then knowing the answers to those might be
important to you.  I had best not dwell on the revelation
that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCutcheon</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nebraska</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teacher</ENAMEX>
of the Year in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>.
         
         
            Words & C
            Born <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1901</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Flagg Gummere</ENAMEX> received a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ph.D.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> languages from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX>; he died around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>
--the date is not given in the brief biography provided
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Francis Marion</ENAMEX>, an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>.  Gummere
was headmaster of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penn Charter School</ENAMEX> for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-seven years</TIMEX>, later taught classics and humanities
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haverford College</ENAMEX>.  We were--how to put
it?--distantly in touch with each other: though we
had never met, we knew some of the same people
and knew of each other.  We corresponded occasionally
(in connection with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>, which he read
and, I think, enjoyed), and his warmth came through
in his letters.  This book is an attractive and friendly
collection of his short pieces on language, written
with the authority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gummere</ENAMEX>'s scholarship and utterly
lacking in pedanticism.  I do not know how
many copies were printed or how much they cost,
but I urge you to inquire and get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> copies if you
can, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to keep and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to give to someone else
who loves language.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years ago</TIMEX>, we published <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Definitive Quotations</ENAMEX> ,
by the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Ferguson</ENAMEX>, a (very) small book
that contains entries like, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúboy</ENAMEX>: A noise with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX> on
it.‚Äù Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brussell</ENAMEX>'s book does not consist entirely
of definitions (unless the genre be very loosely
defined), it comes close enough, so if you like these
things by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> instead of by the score, then
buy it.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> definition is in it, but I could not find
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorites</ENAMEX> (from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DQ</ENAMEX> ), ‚Äú penicillin: just the

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> Given Names
            As all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> probably know, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrence</ENAMEX>
sprang in medieval use from the name of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman saint</ENAMEX> who was martyred by being broiled on
a gridiron in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">258</NUMEX>.  The ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Laurentium</ENAMEX> derived its name from the laurel or bay
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, which presumably grew there.  As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> is
currently published from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Laurel Heights</ENAMEX>, the snake
has swallowed its tail.  In any event, this book is well
known to all who are familiar with onomastic literature,
as, indeed, are other works by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Stewart</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> Place-Names and Names on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> (reviewed
in VERBATIM by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W.F.H. Nicolaisen</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">II,4</ENAMEX>]).
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 or so</NUMEX> pages are devoted to an excellent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">essay</ENAMEX>, titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúHistorical Sketch</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  Those who are interested
in given names or in onmastics in general
would do well to start here, then progress to the
other books by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> and by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leslie Dunkling</ENAMEX>.  We

            Appropriate Word
            It seems unnecessary, when we have available
terms like informal, colloquial, formal, nonstandard,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">literary</ENAMEX>, poetic , and even conversational (though I
have never seen the last used), to come up with still
another set of labels, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jules Hook</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of a
number of responsible and useful works dealing with
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, feels that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWE</ENAMEX> (for `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>' and `standard written <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>,' respectively)
tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> something that he might not already
know or feel about usages of borderline words.  Certainly,
there was enough confusion about colloquial
to move lexicographers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few decades ago</TIMEX> to drop it
in favor of informal ; but I used colloquial in a book I
recently completed on the grounds that informal
seemed to be getting contaminated.  These terms
fluctuate.  It is a comfort to know that if my book still
merits reprinting some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> hence, as it is in
machine-readable form, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> need only
write a short program indicating that informal be
substituted for all occurrences of colloquial and, like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">magic</ENAMEX>, the switch will be effected.  Hook goes on at
some expressive length on the subject of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FF</ENAMEX> and SWE
and makes good sense, particularly when he emphasizes
the ways in which language changes, so that
the words classed taboo or formal in one generation
might very well change places.  Of course, the biggest
problem with books of this sort is that the most
they can expect to accomplish is to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> refine
their use of the language: those whom we think
of as needing the greatest amount of help are usually
unaware of the fact; for them, looking up a doubtful
usage in a book like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hook</ENAMEX>'s (or anyone else's, or
even a dictionary) would be unthinkable.  Thus, the
greatest service such a book could render is virtually
aborted by definition.

            Depending on the degree of refinement of
which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> is aware, that holds true for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>
as well.  The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">other day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reid Collins</ENAMEX>, a news
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">presenter</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>, used the expression the wheres
and the whyfors , which, as far as I know, constitutes
a fractured idiom in the category of I could care less .
Hook has an entry for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.D.</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX> that comments on
the placement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.D.</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> and of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX> after
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>; there are ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> who are unaware
of that, so how will they know to look up the
style in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Appropriate Word</ENAMEX> or any other style or
usage book?  Hook is more liberal than I: for instance,
I cannot bring myself to condone spelling
any more as one word in any context.  I do not deny
the fact that it does not appear as one word, but if it
is going to appear that way in anything I have written
it will be after I am dead (and if this carping
keeps up, there will soon be a contract out on me).
For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing, I have not noted any change in the
pronunciation of the compounded <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúanymore‚Äù</ENAMEX>--it
is pronounced as if it were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words (in contrast to
anybody, anything, anyhow, anywhere , etc.)--and I
see no justification for spelling it as a solid word.  In
short, I do not agree with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hook</ENAMEX> in all matters, regardless
of the respect I have for his judgment and
the quality of his writing.  I have not done a careful
comparison among the various usage/style manuals
to see what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hook</ENAMEX> might have that others do not, but
I get the feeling that his work is very much up to
date.  If you write and wish to corroborate the style
of what you have written, you will probably want as
many books of this kind as you can lay your hands
on, and it would definitely be a good idea to acquire
this one.

            Appositional Elegance
A <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Brief Exposition</ENAMEX>



            It has been a commonplace of language studies to
explore signs and use them to elucidate the phenomena
of elevation and degradation in the language.
One can readily assess the relative status of
establishments that refer to themselves as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eats</ENAMEX>,
Diner , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Restaurant</ENAMEX> .  One can also assume that in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pub</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> step above a
bar , although a saloon may be a par with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pub</ENAMEX>
since it connotes by-gone as opposed to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
(and therefore old-world) elegance.

            Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past five or six years</TIMEX>, however, I
have observed that elegance has come to be a matter
of phase rather than diction.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House Inn</ENAMEX> ,
for example, has become The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> a Country
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inn</ENAMEX> .  Note there is no punctuation in the phrase
nor a capital letter on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> article, and it is the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> article that appears to be a key.  (I should
note that all examples come from establishments in
and around the more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">‚Äúelegant‚Äù resorts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>, although I have witnessed the
phenomenon in many parts of parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>).

            The article in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second half</TIMEX> of the phrase,
both makes the phrase appositional and indicates the
upgrading of the referent.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> example is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meredith</ENAMEX>
Station a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Restaurant a Grill a Niteclub</ENAMEX>; this location
would appear to give the establishment a greater cachet
than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meredith Station</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Restaurant</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grill</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niteclub</ENAMEX> and certainly more than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meredith Bar</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grill</ENAMEX> .  The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">series</ENAMEX> in this example helps to establish a
set of alternative uses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meredith Station</ENAMEX> and the
rhythm appears to suggest mounting excitement.

            The apposition is to be distinguished from the
adjectival modifier such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barney's</ENAMEX> Good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> in a
Country Atmosphere , which serves to describe more
precisely the type of establishment the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motorist</ENAMEX> is
approaching.  Such phrases as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Restaurant</ENAMEX> and
Country Dining give clues to the eye as to expense
and dress as well as to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX>'s attitude
towards <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and perhaps charge cards.  Normally
they are not prefixed by an article.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Appositions</ENAMEX> abound in some areas of the country
and not restricted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.  They seem
to be a mainstay of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">condominium resorts</ENAMEX> like The
Margate at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Winnepesaukee</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Premier Lakes Region</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resort</ENAMEX> (which suggests ownership); Winterberry a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resort Village</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moon Ridge</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Point of View</ENAMEX> ,
which contains a nice whimsy.  One can also see appositions
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barbers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hairdressers</ENAMEX> who go
to great lengths to distinguish themselves.  Split
Ends a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cosmetology Shop</ENAMEX> is a nice example of appositional
elegance combined with euphemism in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">appositive</ENAMEX> and the low key or off-beat opening.  Colanders
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vermont Housewares Outlet</ENAMEX> uses the definite
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> in the apposition to suggest both uniqueness
and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> status.  This use differs from
the use of the appositional, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Movie</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Book</ENAMEX> ,
which gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> a sense of connection with
some previous experience.

            The use of the appositive to elevate appears to
be a commercial manifestation of titular colonicity,
the phenomenon noted first by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.T. Dillon</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>.  The phrase refers, of course to the use of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colons</ENAMEX> in titles of scholarly works.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dillon</ENAMEX> argues that
the prestige of a field can be empirically determined
through the counting of the percentage of colons in a
a corpus.  He demonstrates his point through a comparison
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> fields: literature, psychology, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> and their increasing use of colons in titles
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s and 1980s</TIMEX>.  Literature led the way but
the other fields have caught up.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dillon</ENAMEX>'s article is a
masterly socio-graphic analysis.

            It would seem that the commercial world has
seen the power of titular colonicity but has had to
devise its own manifestation.  A colon makes sense
on a title page.  But would it work on a billboard?  I
think not; therefore the appositive.  The device is
not without its pitfalls however, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> the following:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry David</ENAMEX>'s a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Restaurant</ENAMEX> .  The combination
of the possessive and the apposition creates a
solecism unless we assume that a word was omitted--perhaps
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pub or Saloon</ENAMEX> .  I have passed the sign
several times in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</TIMEX> and recently
noted that it had been cleaned and repainted, but
the apostrophe remains.  What <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry David</ENAMEX> possesses
remains an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enigma</ENAMEX>.  But we know that it must
be an ‚Äúupscale‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gaelic View of Heather</ENAMEX>



            I once read that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eskimo</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-odd</NUMEX> words for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">snow</ENAMEX>, not all of them impolite, which is not surprising
in view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic</ENAMEX> habitat and lifestyle.
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gael</ENAMEX> of Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Highlands</ENAMEX> endured an equally pervasive presence in
the form of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of square miles</NUMEX> of heather covering
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moor</ENAMEX> and mountain to almost the complete extinction
of other forms of vegetation.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moor</ENAMEX> and
mountain use the same word in Gaelic ( monadh ) but
more to the botanical point is the probable relation
of moor to das meer , `the sea.'  The loneliness and
the heather-cloaked undulations of the vast deer forests
of northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX> (forests distinguished by a
complete absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>) are indeed evocative of
the sea.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heather</ENAMEX> grows best in a maritime climate, and it
is no coincidence that the homelands of the Celtic
fringe in many places correspond to the western
fringes of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celts</ENAMEX>, pressed to the sea by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX>, survived in lands either too rough for
effective military operations or too incompatible to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agriculture</ENAMEX>, but not too inhospitable for the Erica
plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.  Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celts</ENAMEX>, this botanical family
was well adapted for survival in rough <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX>.  It can
grow in sand; it can grow in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bogs</TIMEX>; and because of a
symbiotic relationship with a wide range of fungi, it
can grow in stony or peaty lands that provide no
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nourishment</ENAMEX> to ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>.

            In some places the names of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and the
wasteland where it grows are synonyms.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>
it is maquis (and also the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guerrillas</ENAMEX> who
lived there).  In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">southern England</ENAMEX> it is heath (also
giving heathens , it appears, for those who lived
there).

            While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardeners</ENAMEX> today make the distinction between
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heath</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">heather plants</ENAMEX>, these words are
said to derive by separate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX> from some ancient
word for wasteland; heath via the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Saxon</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heather</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norse</ENAMEX> hadder .  In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scandinavia</ENAMEX>, the plant
itself is called lyng or ling , which is a common name
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Yorkshire</ENAMEX> and northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> generally for
what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scots</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> call heather .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ling</ENAMEX> is used as
a name in parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX> too, but this includes the
rough grasses as well as the heathers that grow on
the wasterland.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heath</ENAMEX> is another common name used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>
for the common heather , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardeners</ENAMEX> everywhere
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reserve</ENAMEX> heath for the closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that are
not heather .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heath</ENAMEX> has also been used for the other
shrubby non-ericaceous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> like gorse ( furze ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">whins</ENAMEX> ) and broom that could survive on the heath.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cornwall</ENAMEX>, heather is called by an altogether different
name, namely, grig ; and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wales</ENAMEX> it is called
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grug</ENAMEX> (pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúGREEG‚Äù</ENAMEX>); both words are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celtic</ENAMEX>,
reflecting their ancient homelands.

            In the Gaelic parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX>, the
word for heather was fraoch , pronounced nearly like
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> fr√∂ch .  There are many regional differences
in Gaelic, and fraoch can be pronounced ‚ÄúFREWX‚Äù or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúFRAWX‚Äù</ENAMEX> in some parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaeldom</ENAMEX>, perhaps explaining
some of the spellings that have come into
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> for health-related words like frawlin or
fraughan for blueberry, and freuchan for the ‚Äúreinforcing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toe</ENAMEX> cap of a brogue‚Äù (shoe, not accent) to
prevent excessive wear by the heather.

            While heath, heather , and ling represent the
Germanic input into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, only grig (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornish</ENAMEX>) has
made it directly from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celtic</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  The Celtic
names grug and fraoch apparently come from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old</ENAMEX>
Celtic v-roikos , which is cognate (or so says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX>'s
               <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Etymological Dictionary</ENAMEX> ) with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> brucus , meaning
`maned or bristled.'  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heaths</ENAMEX> and heather are indeed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">finely leaved plants</ENAMEX> which in a sense are bristly, but
their botanical name ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erica</ENAMEX> for heath, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calluna</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heather</ENAMEX>) reflect the properties of their stems.  Erica
is ultimately from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> for `easily broken,' and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calluna</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> word for `sweep or
broom,' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">heather twigs</ENAMEX> being superior to those of
heath for this purpose, which indeed might leave as
much mess as it cleared up.  Calluna , although many
variant garden forms are known, consists of only the
one species, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calluna</ENAMEX> vulgaris .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erica</ENAMEX> (the name Linnaeus
gave originally to both heath and heather),
however, comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, nearly
all found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>, with fewer
than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> found in the rest of the world.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX> only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> exist; Erica cinerea and Erica
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tetralix</ENAMEX> .  In spite of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linnaeus</ENAMEX>' epithet (`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ashy</ENAMEX>'), the
former is called bell heather by all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scots</ENAMEX> and fine-leaved
heath by many botanists; the latter is often
called bell heather , too, by noncritical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>
(since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> are very bell-like), but is known as
the cross-leaved heath by those who pay more attention
to the strongly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-ranked arrangement of the
tiny needlelike leaves.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ireland</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other heaths
as well, namely <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E.erigena</ENAMEX> (`<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Irish born'</ENAMEX>) and the rarer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. Mackaiana</ENAMEX> (`<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mackay's Heath'</ENAMEX>), and a closely related
plant called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.Daboec's</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connemara Heath</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">heath</ENAMEX> has gone through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> prior botanically
mandated name changes, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. mediterranea</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. hibernica</ENAMEX> , which is why <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> heath is
another name for it.

            Though there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> very rare)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of heath in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> very local
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heaths</ENAMEX> found mainly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dorset</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cornwall</ENAMEX>, the
overall picture for the common experience in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaeldom</ENAMEX> is one heather and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> heaths in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>,
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heather</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> (or possibly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>) heaths in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX>.  With so limited a number one might have
supposed a simple array of Gaelic terms would suffice
for unarguable assignment to the proper <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>,
but that is not so.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish Gaelic</ENAMEX> has an extensive written literature
based on old monastic tradition (and the newer nationalism),
but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scots</ENAMEX> Gaelic by comparison is in poor
shape.  It was dropped at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> of Gaelic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> in
favour of English <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 900 years ago</TIMEX>, perhaps to
please an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX> or perhaps to ensure the
retention of the English-speaking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of Northumbria
ceded to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>.  But the effect was the gradual
displacement of Gaelic by the development of
Scots <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> parallel with southern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> (as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">successors</ENAMEX> to the respective <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Anglian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saxon</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mainstreams</ENAMEX>).  The rare appearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scots</ENAMEX> Gaelic
in written documents, at least in surviving written
documents, until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as late as the 15th</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th century</TIMEX>,
is perhaps a consequence.  Or perhaps it was the
strong Celtic-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Druid</ENAMEX> emphasis on oral transmission
that led to the situation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of this century</TIMEX>
that while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 230,000</NUMEX> who
spoke Gaelic (many of whom, however, also spoke
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>), the majority was technically illiterate in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaelic</ENAMEX>, being unable to read or write in their own
tongue.  At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">1901) Ireland</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">640,000</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gaelic speakers</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 4 million</NUMEX>,
the same as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isle of Man</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gaelic speakers</ENAMEX>, but, alas, they have almost disappeared
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.

            Scots Gaelic dictionaries are heavily dependent
on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, especially for the older words, and
the dictionaries are full of variant and regional
forms.  There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scots</ENAMEX> Gaelic dictionaries
readily available <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dwelly</ENAMEX>, was issued
in fascicles from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1901 to 1911</TIMEX>, and although the
10th edition was published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, it is only a photocopy
of earlier reprints containing the same errors
as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> edition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dwelly</ENAMEX> set out to compile
the Gaelic from all earlier dictionaries and was
very successful in an encyclopedic effort; but the
work would have been more useful had it an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>-to-Gaelic
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> and provided some etymological
clues as to meaning.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> dictionary, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MacLennan</ENAMEX>, is two-way
and ventures a modest etymology which is helpful.
But the recently issued edition is again only a
photocopy of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1925</TIMEX> original, and is maddening
in its failure to separate senses through lumping
together of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> homonyms without explanation
(e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crow</ENAMEX> : `<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>,' `boast,' or `pry-bar'?).

            Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dwelly, MacLennan</ENAMEX>, and a list of plant
names in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1925</TIMEX> book of tartans (published by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.A.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K. Johnston</ENAMEX>) I have compiled the following Gaelic
names for heather with their literal translations.
Sometimes these are given by the dictionary; sometimes
it is the best guess I can come up with in spite
of the inconsistencies, the regionalisms, and the often
considerable changes in the inflected word stems
of Gaelic which create huge pitfalls for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novice</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX>.

            In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dwelly</ENAMEX> gives other terms for bell
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heather</ENAMEX> or smooth-leaved heath, as he calls it:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAELIC            ENGLISH</ENAMEX>

            while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MacLennan</ENAMEX> gives:

fraoch        `faulty, blemished(?) or twiggy(<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>?)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dwelly</ENAMEX> also gives fraoch-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an</NUMEX>-ruinnse for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-leaved heath ( <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. tetralix</ENAMEX> ) which might mean
`heather with the long tail,' but more probably
means `heather for rinsing or scouring.'  In Scots
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English</ENAMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burns</ENAMEX>'s songs) reenge (in its variant
forms) is a `scouring pad made of the twisted stems
of heather,' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. tetralix</ENAMEX> presumably being best for this
purpose.

            From <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.A.K. Johnston</ENAMEX> we learn that fraochdearg
was the badge of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MacDougal</ENAMEX>; fraoch-geal
(white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">heather</ENAMEX>) the badge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MacDonnells</ENAMEX>; and
fraoch gorm the badge worn by clans <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MacDonald</ENAMEX>,
MacNab, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MacIntyre</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MacAlister</ENAMEX>, which practice
could have been rather confusing during periods of
clan warfare.  He also assigns dluth fraoch to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robertson</ENAMEX>, translated as the `fine-leaved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heath</ENAMEX>' (i.e.,
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. cinerea</ENAMEX> ) but which is literally `near or close to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heather</ENAMEX>'; and fraoch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nam Meinnearach</ENAMEX> is assigned to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clan Menzies</ENAMEX>, though the name probably derives
from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Archibald Menzies</ENAMEX>, a well-known <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX>
botanist of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, rather than from a very
rare heather this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX> is not likely to have encountered,
never mind worn into battle.

            Other Gaelic words related to heather are:


fraoch-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mara       seaweed `heather</ENAMEX> of the sea'
fraochan          bilberry, blueberry, or
                    whortleberry
fraochag          cranberry, but also bilberry, etc.
dearcan-fraoich   blueberry `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">berry of the heather</ENAMEX>'

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dwelly</ENAMEX> also gives fraoch nam curra bhitheag
without translation.  Since word order and aspiration
give conflicting clues as to noun and adjective, a
number of literal meanings, all equally implausible,
seem possible.  Though a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardener</ENAMEX> might well
suggest `heather of the pointy bit,'a hungry man
could come up with `anger at an unusually small
portion,' and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX> `a sour expression due to an
uneven bite.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dwelly</ENAMEX> says, ‚ÄúSee fraochan,‚Äù But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fraochan</ENAMEX> can
be blueberry or, cranberry,' or a fit of
passion,' or part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>,' or the `extra toe-cap of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shoe</ENAMEX>,' This suggests the real translation is `a tapered
little piece of (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather</ENAMEX> to prevent wear of the shoe by
the) heather.'

            Fraoch itself has other meanings which must go
back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Celtic</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dwelly</ENAMEX> gives a `ripple on the
surface of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>'; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MacLennan</ENAMEX> says, `bristles,
anger, a girning expression of countenance.'  To help
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-Scots</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, I should add that girning by a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bairn</ENAMEX> is the precursor or consequence of greeting,
which, like girning, is very grating to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>.

            So, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">golfers</ENAMEX>, the next time you are in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>, ponder why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaels</ENAMEX> used such
combustible terms for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heather</ENAMEX> and eschewed the
features like bells and crosses that impressed
themselves on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Saxons</ENAMEX>.  And as you search for
your ball in the fraoch, keep that fraoch off your
face; and though you feel like eschewing your
bootlaces, be careful what kind of fraochan you are
eating.
         
         


            I was surprised and dismayed at the content of
the lead article in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">VERBATIM, ‚ÄúThe Germanization</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American English‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVI,4</NUMEX>].  You must be desperate
for articles, to have published such a thinly-disguised
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">screed of Teutomophobia</ENAMEX>.  Indeed, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX>'s
call to purify <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germanic</ENAMEX> influences
reminds one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> hysteria over ‚ÄúFranglais,‚Äù
or of the more sinister <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX>
when a ‚ÄúTelefon‚Äù become a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúFernsprecher,‚Äù a ‚ÄúRadio‚</ENAMEX>Äù
become a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúRundfunk,‚Äù</ENAMEX> and so ordinary a personage
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mama</ENAMEX> became a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fricka</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúMutti</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> is so distressed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX>, I invite him to leave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX>
and take up residence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>.
There he can take his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pick</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> in which to
begin undoing the damage of gerundial clauses that
take an accusative (‚ÄúWe appreciate you coming...‚Äù);
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anarchically ‚Äúcreative‚Äù</ENAMEX> spelling (no modern
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> seems capable of distinguishing between
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúphase‚Äù and ‚Äúfaze</ENAMEX>,‚Äù let alone spelling words
like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúinternecine‚Äù -- ‚Äúinternascene‚Äù?</ENAMEX>!); and worst of
all, the epidemic of split infinitives that has plagued
this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several years</TIMEX>.  (True, no less
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.W. Fowler</ENAMEX> gave short shrift to
those who would split hairs over split infinitives; but
I feel fairly sure that even he would draw the line at
a phrase like, ‚ÄúTo be or to not be ...‚Äù) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Incidentally</ENAMEX>,
I refer Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fowler</ENAMEX>'s comments
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> language under the heading ‚Äúfused
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">participate‚Äù in A Dictionary of Modern English Usage</ENAMEX> .

            Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> may find a crumb of comfort in realizing
that things in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> could be <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúworse‚Äù</ENAMEX>; apparently,
back around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1776</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> missed being
the official <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> language by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> vote.  For myself,
I have not ceased to lament that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-vote decision.
In any event, may I suggest that in future,
when considering essays for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>, you ask
yourself if you would publish the essay if the foreign
language under discussion were, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polish</ENAMEX>
or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>.  If not, then the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">essay</ENAMEX> is clearly bigoted, and should not be accepted
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> at all.





         
         


            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy Stoller</ENAMEX>'s letter [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVII,1</NUMEX>] identifies <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leiber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Stoller</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creators</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúIs That</ENAMEX>
All There Is?‚Äù  She has inadvertently slighted that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">giant of Tin Pan Allee</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Mann</ENAMEX>.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Disillusionment</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1897</TIMEX>), an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> recalls the
past:


‚ÄúSo this,‚Äù I thought, ‚Äúis a fire.  This is what it is
like to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> on fire.  Is this all there is
to it?‚Äù

Then, remembering being jilted, he asks,
‚ÄúIs this all?‚Äù

Finally, he expects death to be

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äúthat</ENAMEX> last disappointment....  So this is the
great experience--well, what of it?  What is it after
all?‚Äù

            

            And all these years <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> have jeered at
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinrich</ENAMEX> as the great popularizer!





         
         



            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>, as we know, is about language.  It is
difficult to keep language distinct from writing,
though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX> might have become
aware that the reviews of books appearing in these
pages often comment on the execrable turgidity of
the writing of most linguists.  To be sure, proficiency
in linguistics offers no assurance of proficiency in
writing; indeed, from the extensive reading I have
done in the subject, I could easily be led to believe
that the former precludes that latter.  It is questionable
whether comments on writing made other than
in the course of reviews is appropriate in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>:
perhaps they are best left to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">periodicals</ENAMEX> that specialize
in such matters, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Writer's Digest</ENAMEX> and The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Writer</ENAMEX> .  However, since many of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>
are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, professionally or not, a few personal remarks
might not be considered entirely inapt.

            It must be seen that there are many, many different
kinds of writing.  For the sake of convenience,
writing is divided into fiction and nonfiction, with
subdivisions of each, too numerous to list here.  Because
of the nature of my own work, I read little
fiction and write virtually none, though <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX>
ago I did win <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prize</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> for a short story:
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> prize was a dinner for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> restaurant
I shall not identify; I have a feeling that the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prize</ENAMEX> was a dinner for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> at the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>,
but that did nothing to diminish my elation
at having won.  That elation was followed at once by
the ineluctable conviction that the other submissions
must have been very bad for my poor effort to have
taken the prize, and my feelings about the story
have vacillated between those extremes ever since.
In short, I am not what is known in the trade as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúcopy proud‚Äù</ENAMEX>:my feelings about my own writing
range from occasional smugness with a job well done
to abject frustration and misery at my inability to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> myself articulated in writing (given the
amount of time and resources available).  I fancy that
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> feel the same way.

            I often question whether I am a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>.  If a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> is, by definition, one who writes a fair amount
and does so professionally (for which read ‚Äúgets paid
for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">it‚Äù</NUMEX>), I suppose I can call myself a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>.  On the
other hand, I know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who write a great deal,
and who write very well, but whose work has never
been published.  It is unfair to include being published
as a criterion of being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>--at least a
good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>: as we all know, some of the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>
seem to have been published only by the merest
chance; we also know that some of the worst writers
are published continually and have miniseries and
films made from the trash they grind out.

            My sentiments about my own writing alter rapidly
when I encounter a singularly felicitous piece of
writing, and in this connection.  I must bring to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reader</ENAMEX>'s attention a collection of essays by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. Ober</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">M.D.</ENAMEX>, called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bottoms Up</ENAMEX>!  The paperback
edition I have was published in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.H. Allen</ENAMEX>, as an <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Allison & Busby Book</ENAMEX>; it was published
earlier in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, but a bookshop or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> will have to supply the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>'s name.
The essays were originally published in periodicals
like the Bulletin of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Academy of Medicine</ENAMEX>,
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Journal of Dermatopathology</ENAMEX> ,
and other professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ober</ENAMEX> is a
(now retired) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathologist</ENAMEX>.

            There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> essays in the collection, and
if anyone ever had any question about how to distinguish
erotica from pornographica, the answer lies in
these pages: some of these essays are clearly erotic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">(‚ÄúBottoms Up</ENAMEX>!The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fine Arts and Flagellation</ENAMEX>,‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúRobert Musil: What Price Homosexual Sadism?</ENAMEX>,‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúCarlo Gesualdo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Venosa: Murder, Madrigals</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Masochism,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Iconography of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fanny Hill : How to Illustrate a Dirty Book‚Äù</ENAMEX>), but
they are not pornographic; others are somewhat
more clinical (‚ÄúJohnson and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boswell</ENAMEX>: `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vile Melancholy</ENAMEX>'
and `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Hypochondriack‚Äù</ENAMEX>); all exhibit a
quality of writing rarely encountered.  I have never
discussed writing with ober, and I am tempted to
ask him whether he must labour mightily to produce
the causal intellectualism  that prevades his essays.
(He has another collection, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boswell</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Clap & Other</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Essays</ENAMEX> , from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>(s), which is as good
as this one.)  Occasionally, when the opportunity presents
itself, he deliberately drops a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">delicious tidbit</ENAMEX>:


Following this epicene epiphany of ephebic
eroticism, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">T√∂rless</ENAMEX> experiences a profound guilt
reaction.

            

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> gets the distinct impression that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ober</ENAMEX> enjoys
what he is doing.  On the other hand, who can
be sure?  Some of the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> complain that
their best work is the result of monumental mental
effort and many painful rewritings.

            This seems an appropriate point to insert a personal
confession.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> who have noted a marked
increase in typographical errors in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> can lay
the blame on my doorstep, which supports a very
low boredom threshold.  All submitted articles are
read by me; if they are worthy of consideration, they
are read again, carefully, and styled for the compositor;
by the time the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">proofs</ENAMEX> arrive, I am reading the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> time and cannot see all the horrible
things the typesetter might have done.  It is not
that the articles are boring, merely that the tedium
of reading them for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> time interferes
with my ability to identify mistakes.  Besides, if
there were more errors, they would probably be
easier to catch.  But we have very good compositors,
and if they make errors, they are often very subtle.
In the future, I shall try to arrange for someone else
to read proof on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>.  End of apologia.

            As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> can tell, both from these comments
and from my shabby efforts in this periodical,
I can rarely support the rewriting of my own material
and, in fact, almost never rewrite anything of my
own.  If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> wants to read something that is
not only informative and entertaining but can be admired
for its style, panache, and humor, let him get
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ober</ENAMEX>'s books.

            If I find the space to treat this subject again, I
shall discuss the dark side of writing, writing that is
unutterably boring the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time it is read.
