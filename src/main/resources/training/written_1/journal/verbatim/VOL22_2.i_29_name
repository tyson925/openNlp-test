            Once upon a time, as they say in all the best
fairy tales, one of the most unlikely treaties
ever envisaged was forged between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>
who were poles apart in almost everything except
their mutual dislike of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> that separated
them geographically.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Auld Alliance</ENAMEX>, a treaty
of accord between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>, was born.
Today, nearly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven hundred years later</TIMEX>, it remains
intact despite the vicissitudes of time and a language
barrier that only the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> have ever made much
effort to surmount.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Luck of the Bodkins</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.G. Wodehouse</ENAMEX>
remarked on the ...look of furtive shame, the
shifty, hangdog look which announces that an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Englishman</ENAMEX>
is about to talk <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>....  The inimitable
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wodehouse</ENAMEX> was, as usual, spot-on with his
characterization.  We insatiable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> have seen
similar scenes enacted many times around the watering
holes of the world, from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calais</ENAMEX> to the fleshpots of
Douala, from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quebec</ENAMEX> to the silver strands of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">C√¥te d'Ivoire</ENAMEX>.  The average <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brit</ENAMEX> is seldom at his most
confident when forced by circumstance to attempt
the language of another.

            Not all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> suffer
from this malaise when finding themselves on foreign
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">shores</ENAMEX>.  Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Average Scot</ENAMEX> does not, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.  The intricacies
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallic</ENAMEX> subjunctive do not worry him at
all, and for the best reason in the world: he does not
even bother to try.

            There are those who will sneer that a race
which owes its very existence to the ingurgitation of
massive quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porridge</ENAMEX> during its formative
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> is capable of speaking in no other way.  But
Scots have long been inured to such slurs.  As a
proud <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scot</ENAMEX> myself, I feel that a much more probable
reason for this apparent lack of linguistic ambition is
to be found in the regional dialect.  There are parts
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> in which regional dialects can be as incomprehensible
as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tocharian</ENAMEX> to the innocent abroad,
and the farther north one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ventures</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>
the more incomprehensible they seem to become.  It
gets worse in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>.  Strangers listening to any of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> dialects will soon realize that they are as
replete with gutturals as any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Teutonic dialect</ENAMEX>.
Tongues created by God for the pronunciation of
names like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Auchtermuchty</ENAMEX> are quite unsuited to the
more delicate nasal nuances of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> language.

            Each dialect is distinct and distinctive.  Aberdonians
have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doric</ENAMEX>, with its quines <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> and
loons <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glaswegians</ENAMEX> bombard you with The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patter</ENAMEX>, famous for its infamous glottal stop and raw,
street humor.  In the moors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carrick</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galloway</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives converse</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lallans</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lallans</ENAMEX> is the language of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burns</ENAMEX>, and it is a language
in which he wrote most beautifully.  It is, in
fact, not a separate language at all.  It is just one
more dialect of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, but one would have to be
listening pretty carefully to figure that out on first
exposure to it.

            For reasons that need not detain us here, some
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> I happened to be visiting the translation
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX> of a large publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> in darkest
Hertfordshire, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, and I became involved in
conversation with one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, a charming
young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX>.  The subject of regional dialects
in our respective <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> came up.  Being very
new to this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and having, so far, only encountered
school <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, she found it difficult to believe
that dialectal variation could be so great in such
a tight little island as ours, and that so much of it
could be unintelligible to the uninitiated.  We were
interrupted by the arrival of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> clad in a boiler
suit of some antiquity.  I could not recall having seen
him before, but I would have recognized his type
anywhere.  He was a raw-boned, sallow little chap
with sunken eyes and lived-in features, the sort to be
found aplenty in bygone days walking out mean-look-ing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">whippets</ENAMEX> in the thin gray mists of gloaming
around any <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ayrshire</ENAMEX> mining <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.  At that moment
I would have bet my very soul that he hailed
from The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land Of</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rabbie Burns</ENAMEX>, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> words
he uttered showed the intuition inherited from my
mystic forebears to be firing on all cylinders.

            Huv ye seen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ma gaffer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX>? he queried.

            I sneaked a sidelong look at my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> and
a glow of the purest contentment spread slowly
through me.  She was about to get her first lesson,
and I could feel in my bones that it was going to be a
good one.

            I don't think I know your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>, I hedged
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">craftily</ENAMEX>.  What does he look like?

            The little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> took off his cap.  He removed a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">squashed</ENAMEX> cigarette from somewhere inside it and lit
it carefully with the minute, barely smouldering
stump of the old one.  He drew with deep satisfation
on his reefer and exhaled an acrid cloud of blue
smoke around us.  He glanced at her, the world-weary
eyes of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Scotia</ENAMEX> and the prelapsarian ingenuousness
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young Picardie</ENAMEX>'s meeting in a fleeting
look that spanned the ages.  He coughed harshly and
spat copiously on the ground.  Then he let her have
it with both barrels.

            Och, he intoned with Bren-gun rapidity,
He's jeest a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nyatterin</ENAMEX>' wee nyaff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wi</ENAMEX>' a skelly cacke'e
an' a manky, broony-kinna gansey.

            When he had gone, my young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> friend
asked me in understandable bewilderment, What
sort of language was that?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, I replied innocently.

             <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>??!! 

            Well, yes, sort of...

            Oh my God! she exclaimed, appalled.  And I
am supposed to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX>! What on earth was
he saying?

            I thought carefully for a moment or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> before
committing myself:

            He intimated that, in his humble opinion, his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overseer</ENAMEX> is a loquacious and diminutive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> of a
somewhat devious and unpleasant bent, that he is
afflicted with a strabismus of the sinistral optical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>, and that he is currently attired in a rather
noisome woolen torsal garment of an indeterminate
off-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate hue</ENAMEX>.

            She stood before me like a stricken stirk, her
eyes glazed and her mouth agape.  Then her teeth
clicked shut and she lanced me with a look of frosted
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>.  I theenk you are taking the meeckey
out of me, she ground out savagely.  And off she
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flounced</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Auld Alliance</ENAMEX> must have been strong indeed
to put up with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> centuries of this sort of
stuff.

            An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aye</ENAMEX> for an Aye




            I cannot really lay claim to being a native of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Country</ENAMEX> as most of my ancestors
left the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Borders</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Industrial Revolution</ENAMEX>,
and I was born farther south, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Yorkshire</ENAMEX>.  However,
I did live a large part of my life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seahouses</ENAMEX>, a
small fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> on the north Northumbrian
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast</ENAMEX>.  Even though I consider <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northumberland</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish Borders</ENAMEX> to be home, technically I am
still a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yorkshireman</ENAMEX>, and, having been raised in that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">county</ENAMEX> of virtually unshakable local accents, it was
natural that my tongue would give me away and that
I would be called a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yorkie</ENAMEX> when living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northumberland</ENAMEX>.
But on return trips to my birth place,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Northumbrian</ENAMEX> influence would show and I
would be baited as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geordie</ENAMEX>.  (I have since gone
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">international</ENAMEX>: I'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pommie</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> and an
Aussie when back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>!)

            While in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northumberland</ENAMEX> I did serve my time
on a coble, a traditional fishing boat working out of
that tiny harbor not far from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> border,
and it was during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those years</TIMEX> at sea that I learned
some of the more subtle intricacies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northumbrian</ENAMEX>,
in particular that most flexible of all words--
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aye</ENAMEX> .  To most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the English-speaking world,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aye</ENAMEX> means yes, as in that well-worn phrase, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aye</ENAMEX>,
aye, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skipper</ENAMEX>.  But the initiated know that there is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX> deal more to this little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gem</ENAMEX> than meets the ear,
so to speak.

            I remember walking down to the harbor, early
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> very misty <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Yorkshire</ENAMEX>
who was coming out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> to watch us
haul the creaves (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lobster pots</ENAMEX>).  As we neared the
village we met an older fisherman heading in the
opposite direction.  He glanced up as we passed,
shook his head and uttered a terse greeting.

            Thick, eh?

            Aye, I replied.

            That was the sum total of the conversation.  After a
few <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> of deep reflection, my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Yorkshire</ENAMEX> friend
could contain himself no longer.

            What was that all about?  he asked.

            He said that it was very foggy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> and he
thought that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> would probably not be going
out--he asked me if I was of the same opinion.  I
said that I agreed with him.

            My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> lapsed back into thought, stunned by
the hidden complexity of such a brief exchange.  Unknown
to him, the conversation down at the harbor
would be even more perplexing.

            The smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> had no radio or radar, so it
was customary, during adverse weather conditions,
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> to congregate around whatever
spot at the harbor offered the maximum shelter from
the weather of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>.  After an appropriate period
of time, some sort of taciturn <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> decision would
be made on whether or not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> would go out
that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>.  Sometimes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> would stand for
several <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, all attention turned to the prevailing
conditions--and anything else that might happen
by.  As we joined the inevitable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> gathered at
the end of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lime kilns</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> looked up.
The conversation went something like this:

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aye</ENAMEX>?  (In a short rising tone as if to say,
Who's this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX> with you?)

            Another fisherman turned his head.

            Aye, aye.  (These were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> level-sounding
words meaning So your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX>'s going out with you,
is he?  It was more of a statement than a question.)

            Another voice added:

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H'aye.</ENAMEX>  (With an expulsion of breath, and going
down at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>: He'll be lucky to go anywhere
today, with all this fog... it's far too thick.)

            And another...

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aye</ENAMEX>' he.  (This had a long dip in the middle,
with a short ending: That's right, very lucky to get
out.  He'll be lucky to climb down onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>.)
Silence for a while.  Then a more resigned sound
came from within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.  It was almost a sigh:

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aye</ENAMEX>.  (I think everything that you all just said
is correct, I don't think that the mist will clear, not
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX>.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aye</ENAMEX>.  (A short, sharp, high note, with a hint of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contradiction</ENAMEX>: You never know, it could; we'll see
who's right.)

            Silence again.  An old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> of a car bounced past
with several rough-looking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youths</ENAMEX> inside.

            Aye!  (Quite strong, starting low, rising to the
end, as if to say, Going far too fast!)

            Aye!  (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More</NUMEX> of a growl: Yes, a ridiculous
speed to be traveling; and what are they doing, driving
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about at this time of day</TIMEX> anyway?  Up to no good
if you ask me.)

            Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayes</ENAMEX>--all different, but all in agreement.
(A rare thing!)

            Silence.  A big lift (sea, wave) came in the harbor
and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> made a run on their rope ends.
It was studied thoughtfully, the implications for the
prospects of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> mulled over.

            Aye!  (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long</ENAMEX> and strong, quite a dip in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">middle</ENAMEX>: Not only is it misty, but the sea is making
too!)

            Aye!  (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Short</ENAMEX>, resigned, exhaled as a sigh: I
can't see that we'll be out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, just you mark my
words.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aye</ENAMEX>.  (Fairly level, slight dip, then rise toward
the end: That's right, we'd have been far better off
staying in bed.)

            More silence.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> lazily drew his
knife out of his trouser pocket; he laboriously
opened it and began to sharpen the blade on the
corner of the sandstone wall.  There are providence-tempting
implications to be considered in an act like
this.

            Aye!  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Throaty</ENAMEX>, short, rise at the end, hint of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disgust</ENAMEX>: I don't know what you're sharpening that
thing for...)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H'aye</ENAMEX>!  (Strong, definite but falling: Put your
knife away, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, you'll only make things worse.)

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> looked up at the mist.  His face scanned
the bland emptiness of the full sky.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aye</ENAMEX>.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Descending</ENAMEX>, exhaled, slightly wavy, almost
a touch of ridicule: Well, you lot can do what
you like, I've been here long enough, I'm off back
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>.)

            Aye!  (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Short</ENAMEX>, sharp, level: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Me too</ENAMEX>!  This was
followed by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ayes</ENAMEX> of agreement, but all different.)

            Aye, aye.  (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> level, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> one descending:
We'll not do any good down here.  I think
we've made our decision.)

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> started to move off, each going his own
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>.  My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skipper</ENAMEX> turned to me.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aye</ENAMEX>.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Short</ENAMEX>, to the point: That's it my bonnie
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lad</ENAMEX>.)

            My <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Yorkshire</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> looked inquiringly into my face.

            Does this mean we're not going out to sea?

            What could I say?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aye</ENAMEX>.
         
         
            Falls the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Shadow</ENAMEX>




            There's many a glitch 'twixt script and speech.
For a start, the script might be mis-typed or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">semi-legible</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> ignorant.  On a state
occasion during the Queen's recent visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Namibia</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of ceremonies introduced <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Her Majesty as</ENAMEX>
Queen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth</ENAMEX> the eleventh.  And on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish</ENAMEX>
radio requests program <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presenter</ENAMEX>
launched into a dedication to this effect:
And now, a special message for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Donachy</ENAMEX> of
Ballycloran, who is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX>-and-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX>!  ...no
he's not, he's ill .

            And of course, even the clearest of scripts and
brightest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> will produce occasional misfires,
such as:


faulty accessing: a funfair of trumpets; a prawn in
the game; I know you like the back of my head.

mispronunciations: deteriate; <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX>-orkers; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grenada</ENAMEX>
as if written <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX>.

botched tongue-twisters: shallow and slipshod
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shatire</ENAMEX>; that disquieting condition called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kwok</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quease</ENAMEX>; the fire at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tirestone</ENAMEX> fire tactory.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spoonerisms</ENAMEX> and similar transpositions: submersive
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>; a cross-fannel
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">cherry; Tonight</ENAMEX>'s orchestral concert comes to you
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bath Room</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pump</ENAMEX>.

            

            As long ago as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid 1960s</TIMEX>, the phenomenon
was conspicuous enough to inspire the title of a comedy
series on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> radio, I'm Sorry I'll Read That
Again (whence the title of the current I'm Sorry I
Haven't a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Clue</ENAMEX> )--the catchphrase adopted by radio
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">presenters</ENAMEX> as part of their retrieval strategy.

            For all their humor and popularity, such types
of deviation are in reality neither very common nor
particularly revealing.  The interesting types of deviation
are the more common, yet less recognized
types (widely unrecognized, it seems, perhaps because
seldom funny).  They are mistakes at sentence
level rather than word level; prosodic rather than
lexical mistakes; mistakes of stress, intonation, and
syntactic segmenting: in effect, accentuating the
wrong word or syllable, modulating the pitch incorrectly
(a rising rather than falling tone, say, or a
questioning rather than affirming tone), and pausing
in the wrong place.  A well-known literary example
is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quince</ENAMEX>'s mis-structuring of his prologue within A
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Midsummer Night's Dream:</ENAMEX>

               
Consider then we come but in despite.

We do not come as minding to content you [etc].

What is THIS thing called<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">, Love</ENAMEX>?  (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">inquisitively</NUMEX>)

Pick your OWN <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX>! (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">indignantly</NUMEX>)

There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> full-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> ¬¶ odd
teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistants</ENAMEX>.  (tiny pause after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten</TIMEX> rather
than after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">odd</TIMEX>)

It's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">now ten o'clock</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenwich</ENAMEX>.  Meantime, here
is the news.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenpeace</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> blew ¬¶ up an effluent
pipeline in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish Sea</ENAMEX>.  (tiny pause after
blew rather than after up)

            

            Underlying such jokes is a crucial linguistic law:
a written sentence carries a higher risk of ambiguity
than a spoken sentence.  The stage directions
within a written/printed sentence are rudimentary--being
almost always of just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following four</TIMEX>
kinds (in descending order of explicitness):


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">typeface</ENAMEX> (italics or boldface, say, to encourage
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> to accentuate the word);

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">punctuation</ENAMEX> (a sentence ending with an exclamation
point, say, prompts a quite different reading
from one ending with ellipsis dots);

word order (position an element later in a sentence--in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, at any rate--and its chances
of taking the main stress are usually increased);

word choice (a word like disgusting, for example,
specifically invites being enunciated in a withering
tone, whereas the more ambiguous revolting
might not).

            

            Since these cues are so rudimentary, ambiguity
pervades written sentences--sentences in isolation,
that is--and the transition to a spoken version can
therefore be a hazardous procedure.  Can you read
out loud the following sentences, for instance, without
feeling torn between rival renderings?


Do you understand?  (inquiringly, or menacingly)

I spoke to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>.  (accentuating
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>)

She hasn't scooped me, has she?  (confidently, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anxiously</ENAMEX>)

When can I meet your <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mistress</ENAMEX>?

She tried shooting herself.

Build thee more stately <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>.

Do you think we should postpone or cancel the
meeting?

            

            Where the genuinely informative stage directions
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reside</ENAMEX> is not within the written sentence itself,
but in the sweep of the preceding sentences--in the
context.  It is context that makes smoothly intelligible
reading possible.  Context, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Disambiguator</ENAMEX>.
Written sentences that in isolation appear ambiguous
will snap into focus when enmeshed in a larger discourse;
moreover, written language has the advantage
over spoken language in that it allows rereading
(and reading ahead) in order to ensure an accurate
interpretation of a given sentence.

            Consider how indeterminate the following sentence
is, out of context: on which word should the
main emphasis fall?


The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> has also criticized the Bosnian
Serbs for various violations of the ceasefire.

            

            But put the sentence in context, and it suddenly becomes
quite clear where the emphasis lies:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> have criticized <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bosnian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> for
moving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> into a demilitarized
zone south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarajevo</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> has also
criticized the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bosnian Serbs</ENAMEX> for various violations
of the ceasefire.

[approximate transcript of a news report on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC World Service</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 May 1994</TIMEX>]

            

            Obviously it is on the word <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> that the main stress
should <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fall</TIMEX> (to point up the contrast, established in
the preceding sentence, with the word <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> ).
Unfortunately, the newsreader failed to render it
that way.  He placed the main stress on also , overlooking
the parallelism of the sentences and the contrast
that it was intended to foster.  In doing so, he
made nonsense of the report.

            What accounts for this tendency of theirs to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misread</ENAMEX>?  Sometimes it is a clear-cut matter of fatigue
or inattention, speaking trippingly, without attending
to meaning.  (In fairness, it does sometimes
happen that they have little or no time to acquaint
themselves with the script before reading it on air:
stop-press reports flash up on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autocue</ENAMEX>; urgent
traffic bulletins or revised continuity announcements
have to be read unpreviewed from a last-minute
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">printout</ENAMEX>.)  And they neglect, through ignorance or
overconfidence, to take the elementary precautions
that would guard against such lapses: above all, to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mark</ENAMEX> up their scripts, the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> do--inserting
a vertical pause here, or a curving tonemarker
there, or an underlining to cue emphasis, or
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dots to indicate a dying fall...

            Even pre-recorded broadcasts yield a good crop
of clangers.  (Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> examples quoted below, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
fall into that category.)  Perhaps cost-cutting (which
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX>, for example, seems to regard as one of
its main functions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>) has led to cornercutting--before,
during, and after the recording
session: less run-through time, less editorial monitoring,
less post-production checking and polishing.

            Here is a brief selection of examples (limited to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> programs) from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> I collected during
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer of 1994</TIMEX>.  They are broadly of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinds</ENAMEX>:
those in which the wrong word is accentuated and
those in which the pause is wrongly positioned (or
perhaps, in technical parlance, examples of faulty tonicity
and faulty tonality, respectively).

            Towards a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Literature</ENAMEX>




            This brief article describes and illustrates the
struggle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hieronymus Stoat</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947-</TIMEX>) to
produce a completely new literature.  In his own
words:


The concept of things happening is inherently
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bourgeois</ENAMEX> and ultimately capitalist-imperialist.
We must, I believe, strive to rout out these corrupting
influences on literary art; to debourgeoisify
writing.

[letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>]

            

            This achievement could only be brought about by a
completely new style of writing in which nothing
happened.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoat</ENAMEX>'s first attempt, a novella (untitled, like all
his work) opened thus:


The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">haddock</ENAMEX> looked at the wall for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.  The light was on.

            

            He was dissatisfied with this even before the ink was
dry.  Although little appeared to happen, a number
of events were implicit.  For instance, the moment
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sixty</NUMEX>-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> were up, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">haddock</ENAMEX> presumably
stopped looking at the wall--a momentous event in
the context.  And, more subtly, the light's being on
contains the event of its having been turned on.  But,
most tellingly, it was argued by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> that the haddock
looking at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> constituted a happening,
even if it were rather drawn out and somewhat uninteresting.

            Absorbing these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criticisms</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoat</ENAMEX> came to the realization
that the problem lay in verbs.  Wherever
you have a verb, things happen.  By definition.  He
thus tried to write in a completely verbless way.  His
revision of his untitled novella now began:


Pale <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">haddock</ENAMEX>.  Endlessly white wall.  Ambient
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lucency</ENAMEX>.

            

            This was better.  To make up for the missing verbs
he attempted to add interest by scattering adjectives
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adverbs</ENAMEX> everywhere.  But after a time, he had to
recognize that even though the text did not actually
describe anything happening, the mind had an extraordinary
facility to make things happen, unbidden,
to the haddock and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> in the light.  And the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adjectives</ENAMEX> actually helped.  Quite interesting things
could happen, with a vivid imagination.

            Now this was as bad as describing happenings.
After all, the text had no meaning outside the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reader</ENAMEX>'s mind; so if that mind became full of imagined
events as a result of reading the text, then it
had failed in its quest for happeninglessness.  Slowly,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoat</ENAMEX> came to the realization that substantives, too,
were the problem.  Write a noun and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> will
conjure up an image.  Moreover, the image will be
doing something--an event will be happening.
What if they too were expunged, then?  He tried it
and came up with:


Pale.  Endlessly white.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambient</ENAMEX>.

            

            With horror, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoat</ENAMEX> realized that this was worse!  The
text provided a backcloth for all sorts of imaginings.
Amazing events were enacted in the minds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>,
conjured by these suggestive qualifiers: virgins
dreamt of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">knights</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> on white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chargers</ENAMEX>; dirty
old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> elaborated prurient extravagances.

            Reluctantly he was forced to discard nearly all
of these signifiers.  Even prepositions could convey
the impression of happenings.  The single word up ,
for instance, was so loaded with connotation that it
too had to be avoided.  Stoat flirted briefly with a
form of writing that used only the definite and indefinite
articles, but soon became disenchanted with
such lifeless passages as:


A <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the the a the a a the.</TIMEX>

            

            He ruefully concluded that even this could stimulate
an over-heated imagination.

            Meaning: that was the problem.  Where words
had meaning, they would engender images in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>' imaginations.  These images would start to
move and things would start to happen.  What was
needed was a meaningless language.  How about
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin</ENAMEX>?  Granted some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> still understood it, but
not the great generality of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>.  He tried it.

            Video meliora proboque; deteriora sequor.

            A whole new set of problems emerged.  With a little
more imagination, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> could see all sorts of English
words hidden in the text.  With mounting despondency,
Stoat was forced to conclude that the
problem was words.  Any words, any words would
defeat his purpose.  To substitute pictures would be
to enter the world of graphic art and to desert literature.

            In a dream, the answer came to him: punctuation
!  How about a literature that was simply punctuation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marks</ENAMEX>?  He tried it, tentatively at first:


,<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">.;;..,,!,:</ENAMEX>

            


            Then with more authority:


?;,<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">,,.;;:!;;,..?;:...</ENAMEX>\?\\?\.,<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">,</ENAMEX>

            

            Too many semicolons, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purists</ENAMEX>, while the
more pragmatic marveled at the piquancy of the single
(unopened or unclosed?) quotation marks.

            Notes on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quebec</ENAMEX> English



            <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quebec</ENAMEX> shows much evidence of creolization.
Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> live in a linguistically complex
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX>, a mosaic of languages from around the
world in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montreal</ENAMEX>, dominated everywhere by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>
of standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joual</ENAMEX> (from cheval ),
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poitou</ENAMEX> dialect that is
the folk speech of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>.

            My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brigitte Harris</ENAMEX>, who is from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>,
immediately observed many peculiarities of usage
when she arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montreal</ENAMEX> to earn an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.A.</ENAMEX> degree
in applied linguistics at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concordia University</ENAMEX>.
Our plan for her thesis was to count the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallicisms</ENAMEX> in
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> reports of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Schoolboard</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greater Montreal</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970 and 1980</TIMEX> and to compare
them.  We carefully considered spelling, punctuation,
and vocabulary, reasoning that such texts must
have been prepared by several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and vetted
many times, so the texts must have seemed unexceptional
to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>.  We found twice
as many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gallicisms</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> text as in that for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>.

            Textual rules of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> seem normal to native
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Quebec English</ENAMEX>.  For example, the spelling
of the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benedictine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Beno√Æt</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">du Lac</ENAMEX> contains a hyphen instead of a period,
as well as a circumflex accent.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> names for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> are common: poulet frit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fried chicken Kentucky</ENAMEX>; moules mussels; frites
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fries</ENAMEX>; poutine <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fries</ENAMEX> with curd
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gravy</ENAMEX> (named after a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Colonel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poutine</ENAMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robertson Cochrane</ENAMEX>'s enjoyable article, Me
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empathy</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>], says, Why is it... that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will not hesitate to proffer publicly their
guess-work on word origins and other language matters,
when they would not similarly dare to explain
the ordinary facts of botany and chemistry?  But
that is not so; for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Shaw</ENAMEX>, for one, was interested
in language and in evolution (the life force
in Back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methuselah</ENAMEX> ).  But the vitalists, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaw</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bergson</ENAMEX>, weren't alone in trying to explain evolution;
there were also the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamarckians</ENAMEX> (and later in
the then-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lysenkoism</ENAMEX>); the orthogenesis
true-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">believers</ENAMEX>; and, finally, the neoDarwinists,
whose view of random mutations is the currently accepted
explanation.  But even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, with the Ebola
virus, are there explanations that are not guesses?
And in cosmology, what is the Big Bang theory if
not a guess?

            Guess-work on word origins is not and probably
cannot be science, since the matter is not involved
with well-established general theories.  But hunches
and logic and experience surely play a crucial role
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least</NUMEX>).  Take, for instance, the slang word kiester
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">buttocks</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bryce</ENAMEX>, I have read, writes that it
comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>.  But in my <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 70</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of speaking, reading and listening to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>, I
have never heard that word (or read it); also I've
never heard any <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German-speaking</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> use it and
say that it derives from Kies meaning small round
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> (gravel).  But in the largely <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> neighborhood
where I was born and raised, I heard it often.
So, I guess that it's an adaptation of chiostra , referring
to a round thing, like a circle or a globe.  And I
must, or rather, want to say, that one of the prime
reasons for my enjoying Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cochrane</ENAMEX>'s article is
that he demolished the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-empathy</ENAMEX> argument by
using logic and facts.





         
         


            In your review of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Death Dictionary</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">XXII, 1, 18</ENAMEX>],
you appear to believe a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX> who asserted
that most of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who ever lived are alive
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.  [In an earlier discussion of join the majority .]
That has not been true even for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two centuries</TIMEX>.
Today, there are <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 5.6 billion</NUMEX> living <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
If you add the estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> from the
almanacs for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800, 1850, 1900</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>, you get
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.0 billion</NUMEX>--and the real figure for the period was
certainly much higher.  A similar result is arrived at
by calculating in a different way: the almanac estimates
a world population of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">200 million</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AD</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; if
they had quietly reproduced themselves every
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-five years</TIMEX>, with no increase in the rate of
population growth, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 16 billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would
have lived and died since then.

            I suspect that your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX> was misled by
the word exponential in most statements of Malthusian
theory.  The statement would be true for a pure
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exponential</ENAMEX> series (for example, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">series 1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 4,</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8, 16</TIMEX>, it is clear the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 > 1</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>), but humankind
does not increase by such a series.





         
         


            I agree with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashok Mohapatra</ENAMEX>'s basic thesis in
Politicking with Words  [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">XXII, 1, 1</ENAMEX>], but I think his
search for elegant formulations obscured his judgment
in the selection of examples he cites to make his
point regarding the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dictionary</ENAMEX>.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p.2</ENAMEX>)
Stating that ...many words and usages exiled from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany</ENAMEX> now found a place as free citizens
in the world of linguistic glasnost..., he cites only
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Republikflucht</ENAMEX> , which is a true <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX>
neologism, i.e., a new crime--leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>--
which didn't exist before and has since been eliminated
from the penal code.  He is downright silly to
claim that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meinungsfreiheit</ENAMEX> (it should be one word
and capitalized, as all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nouns</ENAMEX> are), Weltreise
(obviously not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wettreise</ENAMEX>, which would mean a trip
to make a bet--only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phileas Fogg</ENAMEX> combined the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freizeit</ENAMEX> have now found a place in the
world of linguistic glasnost.

            Pomposity of expression is no substitute for clarity
of meaning.  Meinungsfreiheit, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Weltreise</ENAMEX> , and
Freizeit were descriptive nouns used in the German-speaking
world well before the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX> regime
came into being, although it, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazis</ENAMEX> before,
connected the latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> with state-run programs
capitalizing on the human desire to travel and have
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> for oneself.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meinungsfreiheit</ENAMEX> is a term both regimes
clearly shunned; I suppose in a sense it was
liberated.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stasi</ENAMEX> is simply an acronym for the infamous
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">communist</ENAMEX> secret <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gestapo</ENAMEX>,
a term well known on both sides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wall</ENAMEX>.
It found its place into the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Duden</ENAMEX> ; OK, so what?
Where is the linguistic glasnost?

            Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohapatra</ENAMEX> is on solid ground in buttressing
his argument with the two widely diverging definitions
of capitalism.  But I am astonished that in his
diligent search he did not come up with the most
glaringly telling example of all juxtaposing definitions:
those for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democracy</ENAMEX> .  It would have been interesting
and enlightening to learn how the communist
state, which called itself a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Democratic Republic</ENAMEX>,
defined the form of government which its every action
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perverted</ENAMEX> and defiled.





         
         


            Intrigued by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton Horowitz</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Discouraging</ENAMEX>
Word [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">OBITER DICTA, XXII, 1, 13</ENAMEX>], I set about tracking
the word balagan along its etymological course back
from the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hebrew</ENAMEX> into which, according to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton Horowitz quoting Herman Wouk</ENAMEX>, the word
was borrowed from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>.

            The entry for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> word in the Tolkovyi
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slovar' Russkogo Yazyka</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1935</TIMEX>), reads as
follows, as transliterated and translated:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balagan</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">balahana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">balcony</ENAMEX>].  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. A light
wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for shows at fairs.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. An amateur
theatrical production with primitive scenery; a theatrical
style based on imitation of this primitive stage-craft
(theatrical term).  Balagan art.  Balagan concepts
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Meyerhold</ENAMEX>'s productions.  II By extension: A balagan-like
show, i.e. a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX>, artistically tasteless, disordered,
frivolous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (derogatory).  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clowning</ENAMEX> turned the comedy into a balagan.  This is
no session, but a kind of balagan.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. A temporary
wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booth</ENAMEX> at a fair.

            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russko-Angliiskii Slovar'</ENAMEX>, compiled under the
general direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.I. Smirnitsky</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sixth</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edition; E.P. Dutton & Co</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX>), defines
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> word in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as follows:


Balagan, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.  (wooden structure) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booth</ENAMEX>; (for presentations)
show-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booth</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. show; (extended meaning)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">farce</ENAMEX>, tomfoolery, preposterous piece of buffoonery.

            

            Does not one come away from these definitions of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> word with the impression that whoever infected
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton Horowitz</ENAMEX>'s software may have taken
the discouraging word directly from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> rather
than from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>?  According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wouk</ENAMEX>'s footnote, as
quoted by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horowitz</ENAMEX>, in modern <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> balagan
has come to mean mess, foul-up, snafu, fiasco.  But
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> meaning of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booth</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX>, vulgar buffoonery
seems to fit better the trick title that appeared
on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horowitz</ENAMEX>'s computer screen.  My
guess is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">joker</ENAMEX> who named the program Balagan
was a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant</ENAMEX>, either to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>
or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, who may well have been aware of
the word's currency in modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hebrew</ENAMEX> but for
whom the meaning remained the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> one.

            Also interesting is the indication in the Tolkovyi
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slovar</ENAMEX>' that the word is of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> origin and that in
Persian it means balcony.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balahana</ENAMEX> looks a lot like
our <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word balcony ; so I looked up balcony in
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Dictionary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>), where I found the etymology given as:


balconye < It balcone < balc(o) scaffold (< OHG
balcho <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX>)

            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third New International Dictionary</ENAMEX> gives a
similar etymology, stating that balcony is ultimately
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gmc</ENAMEX> origin.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tolkovyi Slovar</ENAMEX>' states that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> word for balcony (balkon) is borrowed from
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, which took it from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian</ENAMEX>, not the Germanic
languages.

            So which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> are right, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionaries</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tolkovyi Slovar</ENAMEX>'?  Did the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX>
take their word balcone from some Germanic tongue
and pass it on into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>, and other languages;
or did <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> take the word from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian</ENAMEX>
balahana , as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> did balagan , at least according
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tolkovyi Slovar</ENAMEX>'?  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etymologies</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX>,
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Unabridged</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kluge</ENAMEX>'s Etymologisches
W√∂rterbuch der deutschen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sprache</ENAMEX> have
cognates of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">balagan</ENAMEX>/balcony popping up in Slovene
( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">blazina</NUMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, and most significantly in Lithuanian
( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bal«Ωienas</ENAMEX> ), purportedly the most conservative
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> languages.  I suggest that
these scattered avatars of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">balagan</ENAMEX>/balcony evidence
descent from a single <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Proto</ENAMEX>-Indo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> root,
most prolifically in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian</ENAMEX>.





         
         


            In response to the letter from Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maughan S.</ENAMEX>

probably the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Lydian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> whose name provided the

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">XXII, 1, 7</ENAMEX>].

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Wayne</ENAMEX>'s real name was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marion Morrison</ENAMEX> .

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s name was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce Cary</ENAMEX> , not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carey</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.  The author notes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shirley</ENAMEX> had mainly masculine
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>.  A major <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>

began, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hell</ENAMEX> froze over.





         
         


            There has recently been some opinion in VERBATIM
[<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">XXI, 3, 21</ENAMEX>] concerning the acronym <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AWOL</ENAMEX> .  I
suppose it doesn't matter all that much whether
someone is absent without leave or absent without
official leave--in either case, he or she is probably
in for a heapa trouble.  But, for my <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two cents</NUMEX>' worth,
when I was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Army</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1950s</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX>,
Land of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Morning Calm</ENAMEX>, sometimes referred to as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frozen Chosen</ENAMEX>), I was in a battalion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> unit
and handled daily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morning Reports</ENAMEX> from each battery.
This included manpower accounting.  We always
saw the term and heard it and used it as absent
without leave.  While we had few or no real
instances of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AWOL</ENAMEX>, it was reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>.  The use of
WO for without meant--to us, anyway--that a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who was gone, missing, couldn't be found,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>, was absent and had been granted no leave--
official, unofficial, or what have you.  This was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AWOL</ENAMEX> .  There could be leaves of unofficial nature
(often called hip-pocket leave), but those were
not reported as any kind of leave: they compensated
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> some time off for a job well done or for a
long period in action and were not charged against
ordinary leave allowances.  But being AWOL was a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">no-no</ENAMEX>, whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> or unofficial.





         
         


            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX>'s comments on ...prejudice
against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Negroes</ENAMEX> in many Western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX>...
[<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">XXI, 3, 9</ENAMEX>] were apt but somewhat incomplete.  I saw
equally severe prejudice against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of darker
skin, often including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Negroes</ENAMEX>, by non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Whites</ENAMEX> in two
major <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> in which I worked (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968-70</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978-83</TIMEX>) and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen sub-Saharan</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>
in which I worked (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972-74</TIMEX>).  Bigotry against
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Blacks</ENAMEX>, sadly, is not confined to Western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX>.





         
         


            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.A. Livingston</ENAMEX>'s communication [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>] certainly
struck a responsive chord in me.  I have been
troubled by the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> and AfroAmerican
to describe the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in question, especially
since a dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine, who is solid <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caucasian</ENAMEX>,
emigrated from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> and is now a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> and thus is aptly described as an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX>!

            Since I recently had the privilege of seeing the
revival of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showboat</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX>, I was particularly
interested in the lyrics of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Man River</ENAMEX>.
When I was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1930</TIMEX>'s, the song was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sung</ENAMEX> with the words: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darkies</ENAMEX> all work, etc..
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Sinatra</ENAMEX> recorded it, he said Here we
all work, etc., fitting the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">meter</NUMEX> but supposedly
more correct politically.  I never had any reason to
suspect that the original was other then Darkies
until I recently acquired a CD of songs from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
musical shows which were recorded in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>
as performed there.

            Please look at the lyrics of the song in the enclosed
copy of the notes which accompanied the
CD.  I suspect strongly that this is the way it was
performed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>.  What I now wonder is
whether anyone can authenticate these words as being
the actual words when the show was first performed
in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1927</TIMEX>.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incidentally</ENAMEX>, I was
happy to see the corrigendum of the misattribution
of authorship of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poplollies</ENAMEX> and bellibones , since I was
the one who called it to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan</ENAMEX>'s attention!)

            Let me just add how much I have enjoyed and
continue to enjoy your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>.  I am probably one
of your longest-standing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> (a very awkward
locution but I am probably not one of your
oldest).

perhaps among other things, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bard</ENAMEX> was no
surer on his <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">feet</NUMEX> when it comes to the peripatetic
letter h than the rest of us.

            Its now-you-see-it-now-you-don't habits have
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">haunted English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of virtually every generation
since The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venerable Bede</ENAMEX> was an altar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>.  Although
dropping or adding an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">un-Standard h</ENAMEX> became
a social stigma only in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, the
habit itself is ancient.

            In his preface to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lay of Havelok the Dane</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c. 1300</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Skeat</ENAMEX> cited several h -bombs, including
holde for old, hevere for ever , and Henglishe
for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> .  In addition he found a handful of instances
where the title character was rendered as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avelok</ENAMEX> .  Indeed, the earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Saxons</ENAMEX> had little
more luck with the voodoo h ; in a brief article in an
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1888</TIMEX> issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Notes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queries</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skeat</ENAMEX> wrote:
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Only last week</TIMEX>, I found ors for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hors horse</ENAMEX> in an
unedited A-S manuscript.

            Of course, Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> provided more opportunities
for error.  The time of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bede</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beowulf</ENAMEX> were
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hey-days</ENAMEX>--or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ha</NUMEX>!  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-days</ENAMEX>--for the letter h .  Besides
providing early aspiration for many words, h did
yeoman service in front of the consonants l, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>, r , and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> .  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX> of our verb load for take on water
was haladan , which logically led to the words
hl√¶del ladle and hl√¶den pail.  It is possible to see
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s louse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>, or nit in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OE</ENAMEX> hnitu , but better by
far to illustrate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hn</ENAMEX> start with the felicitous verb
hnappian doze or nap.  Hrog , it seems to this perhaps
perverted mind, is a better word than ours for
mucus of the nose, or snot.  But then, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a loaf</NUMEX> to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Saxons</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only half</NUMEX> , while a whole one
was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a half</NUMEX> .

            The hw beginning accounted for a slew of
words, many of which (such as which ) have survived,
but with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> initial letters transposed.  Here too,
the migrant, mystic h has served as a social shibboleth.
But those who make a big thing of correctly
pronouncing their wh words should know that it is
impossible.  What the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purists</ENAMEX> are doing is
fully sounding the old hw in that order.  And my
guess is that even the most fastidious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> drops
the h from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-person pronoun in the question,
What did he say?
            

            Mind you, the letter h was playing hide and seek
even before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anglo-Saxon</ENAMEX> times.  Its use in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Classical</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin</ENAMEX> was more or less the same as it is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>--as a
weak aspiration, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Romans</ENAMEX> being no more desirous
of exerting themselves than we are.  Spelling and use
were already erratic.  Arena was used as often as the
more correct harena <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX>, and we seem to have
preferred it as well, because that is the word we
adopted for the sandy site of gladiatorial combat,
sand being unbeatable at absorbing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and gore.
As another example, the word umidus has no historical
right to its initial h but sports it anyway.  In the
Romance languages spawned by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, h has all but
disappeared as a symbol of sound value.  It frequently
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">persists</ENAMEX>, however, as an etymological relic
(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> homme from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homo</ENAMEX> ) or with an imagined
etymological value (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> haut , actually from
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> altus , but influenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old High German</ENAMEX> hoh
high).

            Following the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> lead, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> were the
earliest to scrap h entirely.  The result is such Cockney-looking
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constructions</ENAMEX> as orribile and istorico .
They were digging the grave in Old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, but the
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">burial</ENAMEX> service was rudely interrupted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, who were importing French
words prodigiously, now have many examples from
both sides of the letter-shed-- ability and the suffix
- able , as well as such words as arbo(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX>)r , from the cut
stage.  We have others where the h has been reinstated
but is not pronounced ( <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX>, honest, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heir</ENAMEX> , for
example), and still others where the h has been replaced,
but on whose pronunciation we have not yet
made up our minds ( humo(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX>)r, humble, herb ).  When
I was young, we took family vacations near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Huron</ENAMEX>,
where pronunciation was subject to the same
lack of certainty, providing the potential for some
proverbial southwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> jocularity.

            Perhaps the most notorious example of English
dithering in this matter is the word for which a Himalayan
snow monster is named.  Though no one has
met the snow monster, and therefore no one is in a
position to pass judgment on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX>'s disposition,
we seem to feel that abominable is an apt descriptor.
But from the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Wycliffe</ENAMEX> until
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid 1600s</TIMEX>, we spelled it abhominable in the belief
that it sprang from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements ab</ENAMEX> away
from and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homo man</ENAMEX>.  We changed back again
when the abominable truth was discovered that the
word had its own legitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> ancestor, abominosus
meaning away from the omens, or hateful and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">odious</ENAMEX>.  Something similar happened for a while to
preheminent , the suspicion being that the h was inserted
to avoid what the linguists call hiatus.
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> solve this problem by illogically placing
a dieresis over the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> e .

            But h in the initial position has long been the
more nagging nuisance.  Abundance existed as an excrescent
habundance for most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>
and for a good while after that, in the belief that the
word derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> habere to have.  And neither
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hermit</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostage</ENAMEX> began life with an initial h .

            The letter's name, aitch, goes back to Old
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> ache , from a late <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> accha, ahha , or aha --
all or any of them descendants of an earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ha</NUMEX> .
I am sure we will all be happy to know that we are in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly</NUMEX> the same league as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> when it comes to knowing our ahs from
a 'ole the ground.

            Famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> Etymologies



            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prize</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>--in the sense of earliest
recorded and significant--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Australianism</ENAMEX> is generally
awarded to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kangaroo</ENAMEX> , despite the fact that another,
much less striking <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>, the quoll , is noticed in the
same glossary of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> language, that compiled
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Cook</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">navigator</ENAMEX> and explorer, in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1770</TIMEX>.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Some years</TIMEX> elapsed before the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> decided
to establish a penal settlement in the land which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cook</ENAMEX>, when he took possession of it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1770</TIMEX>, primarily
to forestall the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New South Wales</ENAMEX>.
But, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1788</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Captain Arthur Phillip</ENAMEX> landed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Botany</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay</ENAMEX> (near the present <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX>) with a mixed
party of convicts and their military custodians and
sought to use what little knowledge had been passed
on to him of the indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>, their language,
and the new land's <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX>.

            Somewhat to his surprise and that of others in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aborigines</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port Jackson</ENAMEX> (as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX>
Harbour was named) did not recognize the word.
Instead, they appeared to think it was an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
word and borrowed it (as they did other words, like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gammon</ENAMEX> and fellow ) with glee, using it of the cattle
which the invaders had brought with them and apparently
thinking it meant edible <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>.

            This was to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillip</ENAMEX> and others their first
intimation that there was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> Aboriginal
language; but, so distinctive and so immediately
made a symbol of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> itself,
and the word rapidly took on in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and, indeed,
in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.  And when, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1820</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillip King</ENAMEX> landed
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Endeavour River</ENAMEX>, in the north of what is now
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Queensland</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cook</ENAMEX>'s glossary was obtained,
he found that the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aborigines</ENAMEX> did not recognize
the word, using a name something like menuah instead.
It was to be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a century</TIMEX> before the
explanation became clear, and, in the meantime,
several other possibilities were floated.  It was at first
thought that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cook</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">naturalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Banks</ENAMEX>,
who was at his side, had erred, either in their understanding
or in their documentation, and it was later
suggested that an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">informant</ENAMEX> had misunderstood
the question and replied I don't know or
something a little less polite.  It was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX> before the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">linguist John Haviland</ENAMEX> identified the word in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Queensland language Guugu Yimidhirr</ENAMEX>, where it denoted
a particular species of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kangaroo</ENAMEX> and evidenced
the fineness of distinction that characterizes
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> languages.  By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>, of course, the
number and complexity of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> languages was
well known, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port Jackson</ENAMEX> language, or
Dharuk as it is now known, was long extinct.

            As a footnote, and in illustration of the sense of
Aboriginal humor which might have misled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cook</ENAMEX>,
consider the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> word moomba ,
used since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</TIMEX> as the name of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Melbourne</ENAMEX> carnival
and freely translated let's get together and have
fun.  Later scholarship suggests that the city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>
were taken for a ride, the word apparently being
widespread in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Victorian</TIMEX> languages and meaning
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">buttocks</ENAMEX>.

            Aboriginal etymologies are now mostly settled,
the historical and geographical evidence of a word's
early use being brought collectively to bear as in the
case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kangaroo</ENAMEX> .  But where there is no evidence of
borrowing and no feasible source language, some
other explanation has to be sought.  This is the case
with a favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> term for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Englishman</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pom</ENAMEX> or pommy .  At first sight this might appear to be
a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> regional dialect word, but there is no possible
etymon even remotely like it recorded in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wright</ENAMEX>
or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> .  So, whereas for dinkum , for instance, a
sense history can be established that fits chronologically
with a verifiable regional antecedent, for
pommy there is no such answer.  The first task then is
to track the word back to its earliest recorded occurrence
in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian English</ENAMEX> to see if the context yields
any clues as to origin.  And it does.  Both forms are
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> found in popular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>, notably the Bulletin ,
an aggressively <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">weekly</ENAMEX>, and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX>
Truth , also a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> and no less <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX>, but
more scurrilous because more urban in outlook.  In
both papers the chase goes back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>, when there
was a sudden increase in assisted immigration and in
the consequent expression of attitudes to this immigration.
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> displayed an editorial indulgence
in word play.  Both evidence <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> form,
pomegranate , with its tell-tale variant spelling pommy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grant</ENAMEX> .  The rhyme might not have been a very good
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, but the chant went up nonetheless--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Immigrant</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy-grant</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pommy</ENAMEX>-grant--originally expressing
a prejudice against assisted immigration of
any sort, but later, simply because of the numbers
involved, becoming focused on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, and later
still on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  For some reason unknown to lexicographers
the word became popular, and it was but
a matter of time before it was shortened to pommy
and then pom , both of which were used adjectivally
as well.

            But this explanation, first advanced and documented
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian National Dictionary</ENAMEX> , has
yet to win full acceptance, there still being those
who prefer the unsubstantiated acronym POME
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prisoner Of Mother England</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> pomme
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de</ENAMEX> terre as a source.  There are even those who find
the comparison of the brightly colored <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> with the
ruddy cheeks of the newly arrived <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant</ENAMEX>
sufficient explanation in itself.  Folk etymologies
often have a life of their own.
         
         

            My jugular vein is caught in the bedding




            That statement, we were once asked to believe
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Cleese</ENAMEX>, was an example of the irrelevancy of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian English</ENAMEX> phrase books, along with the well-known,
My postillion has been struck by lightning.
But each age and each culture has its own phraseology.
Already after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</TIMEX> LPs, gramophones , and
wirelesses belong to history and a never-ending tide
of new transatlantic terminology swamps these shores
with the everyday expressions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silicon</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley</ENAMEX>.  Perhaps we need an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy</ENAMEX> to keep
our language pure.  But, whether through technological
or social change, language moves on.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> recent phrase books of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> languages
illustrate how <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> is another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s
mealie-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> language is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swahili</ENAMEX>--as approved
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swahili Committee</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1957</TIMEX>; the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fanagalo</ENAMEX>-- The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lingua Franca of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Africa</ENAMEX>, printed only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years ago</TIMEX> but
using language very alien to the urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Brit</ENAMEX>.  The
phrases chosen aptly describe the sort of society and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these</TIMEX> languages serve.

            Fanagalo, though hardly heard of in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, is
used <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>.
It is a made-up language like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pidgin</ENAMEX> and, unlike
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esperanto</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volap√ºk</ENAMEX>, is based on a real tongue,
Nguni, related to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Zulu and Xhosa</ENAMEX>.  It was created to
meet an urgent need for a common language between
those using the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>-derived <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afrikaans</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> on the one hand
and, on the other, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of the numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African</ENAMEX>
tongues from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angoni</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX> to the Zulus
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Natal</ENAMEX>, all of whom worked together in the diamond
diggings, gold <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mines</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> of the whole
of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mozambique</ENAMEX> and what
are now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Namibia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Botswana</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zimbabwe</ENAMEX>.

            Its vocabulary may look strange but sounds familiar.
Counting, for example, begins: wan, tu, tri,
fo, fayif, sikis ...; while around the home you find
stui <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stew</ENAMEX>, grevi <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gravy</ENAMEX>, pitsh peach, and flauwa
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flour</ENAMEX>.  All these are based on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> words as are
the expressions used in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>: aseyi
hofisi assay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, mayin kapten mine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX>,
blas-fonis blast furnace, and kaplin huk coupling
hook.  The grammar and construction, though, are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nguni</ENAMEX> and distinctly unfamiliar.  The phrases employed
to teach us Fanagalo are indicative of its origin:
Who has stolen the venison?, The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> will
kill your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">intestinal worms</ENAMEX>, I told this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> he must not
go underground, as he is drunk, Open the compressed
air immediately , and so on.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swahili</ENAMEX> is the lingua franca of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Africa</ENAMEX>, but it
has a lot in common with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fanagalo</ENAMEX>, and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> include
many similar words.  However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1957 New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English-Swahili Phrase Book</ENAMEX> demonstrates a rather
different world.  In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX> headed The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>
we find Iron the lace with great care, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mangle</ENAMEX> all these
clothes, We need charcoal for the iron <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, I want
you to buy <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>'s tongues , and--how colonial-- I
want also <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cucumbers, for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>!
Under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farm</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plantation</ENAMEX> there are the following
useful lines: The cowshed roof is leaking badly,
The wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX> are very troublesome , and A lizard got
into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fowl</ENAMEX>-pen .  But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Safari</ENAMEX> and Hunting includes
the choicest phrases: Let all the utensils be safely
packed, Is it lung <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> or heart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>?, Hang up the
kill so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hyenas</ENAMEX> do not get at it, Put <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in
the skull and get the brains out with a stick , and Split
the skull and give the brains to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> .  All very
useful given the right time and place, although
Which way is the wind? and Can they hear us from
here? might be better left unsaid.

            But it is probably the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX> revealed that
already place these books in a bygone age: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrival</ENAMEX>
at the coast gives us I want to go ashore; carry my
loads ; on safari there is Pitch all the white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s tents
in line ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fanagalo</ENAMEX> phrases for <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> include Move
your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shadow</ENAMEX>, Don't rattle the bag , and Have you caddied
before?  I don't want a useless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> .  I wonder if

            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Grow Your Vocabulary By Learning the Roots of English</ENAMEX>
Words
            This book is really a comprehensive study of
word formation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, dealing with roots, prefixes,
and suffixes.  To make it palatable for a popular
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>, it has been published in the guise of a vocabulary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">builder</ENAMEX>, which, I suppose, it is, though anyone
without both the vocabulary to begin with and
an inordinately strong will is very unlikely to find
the book easy to understand.  One might regard it as
a popular combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Darling Buck</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Selected Synonyms in the Principal Indo-European</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Languages</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949 and 1988</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Comparative</ENAMEX>
Grammar of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX>), both
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago Press</ENAMEX>, with something of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edward</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinkerton's Word for Word , Verbatim Books</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">my Suffixes and Word-Final Elements of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Prefixes and Word-Initial Elements</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>), both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gale Research</ENAMEX>, thrown
in.  None of these appears in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bibliography</ENAMEX>, however,
which seems to be given over to books and
articles dealing with the teaching and learning of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vocabulary</ENAMEX>.

            As it seems likely that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> are
not among the prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> for this book
as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vocabulary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builder</ENAMEX>, it is worth reviewing as a
source book for the meaty information about word
formation and to ignore the sizzle about vocabulary
building.  Indeed, the market as perceived by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schleifer</ENAMEX> consists largely of educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and
browsers of difficult words and word <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> of all
sorts: relatively short shrift is given to high school
and college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, and, mercifully, no mention at
all is made of those who might have been sold on the
promise of a better life--or a better after-life, or
perhaps a better half-life--through the acquisition
of an expanded vocabulary.

            The best description of the content is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schleifer</ENAMEX>'s
own, which, to save time and effort, is reproduced
here, slightly edited:


Part I: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COMMON ROOTS</ENAMEX>...provide [s] in-depth
coverage of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> common roots and described, in
detail, the dissection, analysis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX>,
definition, and commentary processes, followed
by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> exercise entries for each root or related
roots.

Part <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">II: HELPFUL HINTS</ENAMEX> is a partial answer key
for the exercises in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COMMON ROOTS</ENAMEX> and provides
the meaning and etymology of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> root per
exercise word.

Part III: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUBJECTS</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> categories of
specialized words and phrases, which are further
divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, each of which, through
an illustrative example and a wide selection of
exercises entries, provides additional practice in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dissecting</ENAMEX>, analyzing, reconstructing, defining,
and providing commentaries for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> words.

Part <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">HOW ENGLISH WORDS ARE CREATED: A</ENAMEX>
SHORT COURSE is a simplified, step-by-step presentation,
which includes a large assortment of easy-to-understand
charts and tables and illustrates
how <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> words are constructed from native
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>-, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>-derived roots to which prefixes,
suffixes, and other roots are affixed in accordance
with precise linguistic rules.  This part
serves both as a self-contained course in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etymology</ENAMEX> and as an explanation of the more
technical <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> data presented in A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CROSS REFERENCE DICTIONARY</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical</ENAMEX>
Information and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Detailed Example</ENAMEX> sections of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COMMON ROOTS</ENAMEX>.

Part V: A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CROSS-REFERENCE DICTIONARY</ENAMEX> is a
combination dictionary-index, which provides
follow-up coverage and page references for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX>
of words and roots discussed in this book.
...[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hen</ENAMEX> used in conjunction with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Part I...</ENAMEX>,
[it] becomes a self-teaching primer for the study
and application of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> etymology.

            

            Unbelievably, Part V, which contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> pages
of small print and is one of the most useful and informative
sections of the book, has not even been accorded
pagination, something for which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> ought to be carpeted for before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bibliographical Court</ENAMEX>.

            For some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, a comprehensive description
of the history of words in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is more information
than they wish to assimilate, and they will be
relieved to learn that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schleifer</ENAMEX> covers the territory
in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about ten</NUMEX> pages.  For those who wish to know
more, there is a neatly put together section on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
(pp. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">175-228</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> (pp. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">228-64</ENAMEX>).
Grow Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vocabulary</ENAMEX> offers an excellent overview
of how words are created and compounded in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
and belongs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> of every word-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Conversational Joking: Humor in Everyday Talk</ENAMEX>
            There must exist some standard, somewhere, for
what passes as witty, funny, hilarious, but it
probably changes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</TIMEX> and depends on the age,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">religion</ENAMEX>, race, financial condition, location, and
other characteristics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX>.  We often
laugh appreciatively at what is clever, though it may
not be funny, humorous, or even mildly amusing.
Take, for example, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> quotations from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarence</ENAMEX>
Darrow given for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 18</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Witty Words</ENAMEX> (in
which, it is easy to see from the subtitle, quotations
are arranged for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day of the year</TIMEX>):

When I was a boy I was told that anybody could

I have never killed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, but I have read many
obituaries with a lot of pleasure.

            

            These are, as the book title suggest, witty; one could
certainly agree that they are facetious; but they are
not funny, and certainly not hilarious.  Sometimes,
the shock of recognition when one encounters
a well-phrased truism is enough to trigger a welcoming
response, which might manifest itself in a smile
to indicate the pleasure of the experience.  But a
smile is not a response to something hilarious.  I
rather suspect that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eileen Mason</ENAMEX> was satisfied with
the title of her book; then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> came along
and stuck in hilarious for advertising purposes.
One could not disagree with outrageous.  Not all
the quotations are witty; an inept one is credited to

            One might comment that safely would not have
disturbed the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">meter</NUMEX> of that poetic thought.

            If one likes this sort of thing, this is a good collection.
It is arranged in calendar order and has
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> indexes, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, one of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holidays</TIMEX>, and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of subjects.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norrick</ENAMEX> might be offended to find a
review of his book so closely associated with what he
might consider to be trivial, but he does expend a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX> deal of text describing the various forms of
humor--sorry, I cannot resist the punctuation--
that come from one-liners and clich√©s (many of
which, after all, are quotations).  There is little humor
in this book, either in the joking or the situations
described, largely because of the analytical approach:
nothing makes a joke fall flatter than having
to explain what is funny about it, especially when it
was not particularly funny to begin with.  It is hard
to tell why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norrick</ENAMEX> persists in interspersing the recorded
conversations with irritating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heh</ENAMEX> heh heh
heh hehhehheh or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ehhehheh</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ha ha ha</NUMEX>.  But
these are natural conversations, and it evidently
takes so little to make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> laugh--an apt metaphor
seems to send them into paroxysms of laughter--that
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> need no longer wonder at the success
of stand-up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comedians</ENAMEX> who rarely say anything
funny but focus on reminding their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">truisms</ENAMEX>.

            Humor, as we are told endlessly by those in the
entertainment profession, is a serious business; Norrick
demonstrates that it is serious for linguists, too,
which we might have suspected once <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freud</ENAMEX> got his
hands on it.

            Puzzle solvers seem to fall into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> categories,
those who use reference books to help them find the
right answers and those who eschew any aids whatsoever.
I have always fallen into the latter category.
If I could not identify a missing word in a quotation,
I marked that down to my own failing, one that was
not likely to be remedied by looking it up in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> ,
after which it would be promptly forgotten; mercifully,
not all clues in puzzles are quotations, so some
of them worked out; besides, the word that had to
be supplied was usually a very common <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and its
only connection with the quotation was that it happended
to appear in it, like be in To be or not to be.
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>, the crossword puzzles published in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, like those published in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>) have been
of the cryptic kind, differing from the typical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> variety by a diagram that does not cross-key
every letter of every word and by clues that are
not simply straightforward matter, like the solution
ers for bitter vetch and other otherwise useless
bits of information; for one thing, many of the clues
are anagrams, which is where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puzlpack</ENAMEX> comes in.  To
save space, here is what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puzlpack</ENAMEX> can do (from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blurb</ENAMEX>):


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢</ENAMEX> Find all single-word anagrams: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EIPRST</ENAMEX> yields
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESPRIT, PRIEST</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIPEST</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPRITE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRIPE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRIPES</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢ Unscramble</ENAMEX> jumbled words.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢</ENAMEX> Find all blank tile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">substitutions</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢</ENAMEX> Find the unknown letters in crosswords:

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢ Verify</ENAMEX> the validity of a word play.

            

            I am not entirely sure that I understand what each of
those means (especially worses and worths),
but experienced puzzlers might.  The program is
simple to load and, once in place, easy to use; it is
also extremely fast.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compact Disc</ENAMEX> has a
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> for finding blank tile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">substitutions</ENAMEX>, but it
does not include all possible inflected forms.

            If everyone had this software, there would be
no point in using anagrams in clues, I suppose; on
the other hand, not everyone does, and the use of
such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aids</ENAMEX> is probably ruled out in competitions
where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrants</ENAMEX> are controlled--that is, not
working at home.  It is also useful for puzzlemakers.

            In view of the abundance of the worldwide population
of the domestic cat it comes as something
of a surprise to learn that no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> can categorically
state where the name for this group of small,
soft-furred carnivorous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> started or when.  We
know the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> was domesticated both in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> and
West in the early historical period, the ancient
Egyptians being credited with having been the first
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to have done so and at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> period in their
history to have worshiped it as sacred.  The name is
found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> centuries
and in the modern languages as far back as their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> go.

            Almost certainly a loanword, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old English</ENAMEX> it is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catt ; Welsh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cornish cath ; Gaelic cat ; Old Irish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kat</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle Dutch</ENAMEX> katte ;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swedish</ENAMEX> katt, katta ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Norse</ENAMEX> k√∂tt-r ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old High German</ENAMEX>
chazza, chataro ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle High German</ENAMEX> katero,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kater ; Modern German Katze</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern German</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> also have kater tomcat ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tom</ENAMEX> denoting
the male of certain species of animal, notably the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> chat ; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">gato</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gatto</ENAMEX> ; Old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> katta ;

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">koshka ; Bohemian</ENAMEX>, male kot , female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kotka</ENAMEX> ; Lithuaniane
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kate</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">katti</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kot</ENAMEX> , male <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> or tomcat
koczur, kocur .  As the above indicates everyone
had or has some sort of word for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>.

            What is also a mystery is why the use of the
word <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> was so often attached as a prefix to other
words.  In some examples I feel the word also suffered
catachresis , a misapplication of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> due to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etymology</ENAMEX>.  Catgut , for example, has nothing to do
with that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> as it is a tough, elastic cord made
from the twisted intestines of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>, used for the
strings of musical instruments.  The first element
might have come from kit small fiddle.  When it is
played badly, however, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX> agree that
there is a feline similarity to caterwauling , from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">caterwawen</ENAMEX> , an uttering of a discordant
shrieking, as from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who is catlike is lithe and active,
moves stealthily and noiselessly, perhaps like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">burglar</ENAMEX> seeking to commit a crime by using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>-walk ,
a narrow ledge, footway, or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>.  Possibly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mannequins</ENAMEX> (fashion models) can be considered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>-like
when they promenade, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>-footed , confident in
moving down the catwalk at a fashion show evoking
no catcalls from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> (unless the designs fail
to be to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX>' liking), eliciting catty remarks,
turning the show into a catastrophe .  It is unlikely
they would have wanted to see examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> suits ,
the all-in-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, neck-to-foot legged garment, worn by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston Churchill</ENAMEX>,
often depicted as a bulldog, frequently wore <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to
work, though he preferred to call it a boiler suit.
Winnie possibly thought his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> suit was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s
whiskers , i.e., good, satisfactory, perfect, ideal for
the task.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s whiskers is a term possibly first
used in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1927</TIMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy L. Sayers</ENAMEX> in her novel
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Unnatural Death</ENAMEX> .  Maybe the early uses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">whisker</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s whisker , a thin wire for establishing
contact on a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crystal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wireless</ENAMEX>) set was thought to be
the same when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listener</ENAMEX> was successful.

            Similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s whiskers is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s pyjamas
meaning anything that is very good, attractive;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> in origin from around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1920</TIMEX>, it had become
Briticized by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1923</TIMEX>.  However, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Partridge</ENAMEX>,
in his <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> , the word was obsolete in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1934</TIMEX>;
but it was far from dead in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late as 1965</TIMEX>.

            In the same war those <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> fighter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> who,
because they could see well in near-darkness, shot
down numerous enemy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> were said to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>-eyed .
A famous ace <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> was known as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cat</ENAMEX>'s-eyes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cunningham</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cat</ENAMEX>-eyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> though are those
with greenish, slinky, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Oriental</ENAMEX>-type eyes.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cat</ENAMEX>'s-eye
is a semi-precious, yellowish-brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>, a variety
of chalcedonic quartz or chrysoberyl, which, cut in a
certain way, reflects light and has a luster like the
contracted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupil</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s eye.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catoptrics</ENAMEX> is the
study of the reflection of light.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> , German
Katzensilber , similarly, is silver that still shines in declining
light.

            A cathouse is a brothel, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> being a former word
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitute</ENAMEX>.  Perhaps some of the latter drank <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> term for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gin</ENAMEX>.  Catting was a
word for chasing after the female sex, i.e., a man
out on the tiles--like a tomcat?  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cattery</ENAMEX> is the
name for the place where numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal cats</ENAMEX> are
housed.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>-hole or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat-</ENAMEX>flap is the entry and exit
site in a door for a household's <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>, the difference
being that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>-hole is merely a hole in the door,
whereas a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>-flap is hinged to swing to and fro and
close the opening automatically.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>-lap is not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>'s lap on which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
can sit or lie and sleep, but a cup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>.  It was so
referred to as far back as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1785</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grose</ENAMEX>, in his
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</ENAMEX> , stated,  <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>-lap :
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>, called the scandal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">broth</ENAMEX>.  Gossip over the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>
cups perhaps?  Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> hold that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> lap
was slops; the stuff a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> will lap.  A catnap is a short
sleep, sometimes after a meal, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> is wont to
have.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catnip</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> name for a plant
known elsewhere as catmint .

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> is a thin layer of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> on a puddle from
under which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> has receded, so named because it
will bear only the weight of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>, or a catling , a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kitten</ENAMEX> walking over it <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>-footed to avoid breaking it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX> is not what might be thought, but a type of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clay</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catbrain</ENAMEX> is a soil containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX> mixed with
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX> is straw and clay mixed together
to make rolls of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> which are laid between
the wood posts in constructing mud walls of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dwellings</ENAMEX>.

            Ironically, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> are reputed to dislike
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and getting wet, there are numerous words
using <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> for nautical and maritime items.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cat</ENAMEX> is abbreviated from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">catamaran</ENAMEX> , used in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX> names like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hobie Cat</ENAMEX> .  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">catamaran</ENAMEX> is a raft of
logs lashed together or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> formed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hulls
held together by a bridgelike framework.  The word
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">catamaran</ENAMEX> comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tamil</ENAMEX> kattu binding,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">katta</ENAMEX> to tie, and maram <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>, meaning logs.  Another
use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">catamaran</ENAMEX> , quite different, is a cross-grained,
cantankerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.

            The cathead is a heavy piece of timber projecting
from the bows of a vessel for hauling anchors
fitted with a stock into position clear of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>'s
side.  It was so called because in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> when there
was much carving on wooden-hulled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> or sometimes a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lion</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> was almost always
carved on it.  This procedure, before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of the
stockless anchor, was known as catting the anchor .  A
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX> purchase is a rope tackle used for hauling an anchor,
especially on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat davit</ENAMEX> , a light crane used on
small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> to hoist an anchor so it can then be
swung round to lower the anchor on to the deck or
overboard.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> pennant is the small pennant used
either as a marker for an anchor buoy or as a signal
that a vessel is at anchor.  A catenary is the curve of
the anchor cable between the anchor on the sea bed
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cat</ENAMEX>'s-paw has several meanings.  One is the
slight ripple on the surface of an otherwise flat sea,
interpreted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> as portending a breeze.  A
variation is a light breeze, just strong enough to ruffle
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> surface.  <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, it is a twisting hitch,
made in the bight of a rope to form <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> eyes through
which the hook of a tackle is passed for hoisting.  A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catshank</ENAMEX> is a knot similar to a sheepshank but with
an extra turn through the loops to prevent their slipping
through.  <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s-paw dates from the late
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th century</TIMEX> as a dupe, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> used by another as
an unsuspecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, or tool, especially in nefarious
transactions.  This version came from the fable
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> which used a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s paw to draw hot
chestnuts from a fire.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A century</TIMEX> later the term <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-foot</NUMEX>
was used for a dupe.  As for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> holes , they
were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small holes cut into the stern above the
gun <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> on a sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> o' war, on the same level
as the capstan, and used for leading a stern hawser
to the capstan when required to secure the ship
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">astern</ENAMEX>.

            There are many uses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> in the naming of wild
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, some having tenuous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>.  A cater-pillar
is the larva of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterfly</ENAMEX> or moth, coming
from the Old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> chate pelouse , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hairy cat</ENAMEX>.  This
dates back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1440</TIMEX> and the word catyrpel , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX>
among the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cat</ENAMEX>'s-head is a very large apple
variety, possibly a cider <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apple</ENAMEX>, the name, dating
back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1617</TIMEX>, supposedly given owing to the similarity
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>
totally different was <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s-head , it being a non-nautical
term for the end of shoulder of mutton.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>-bird
is an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thrush</ENAMEX>, with a call like that of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX>.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">catfish</ENAMEX> has barbels on its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, around the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mouth</ENAMEX>, that slightly resemble a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s whiskers.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cat</ENAMEX>'s<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-foot</NUMEX>
is another name for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> wild plant
ground ivy, so called from the resemblance of the
shape of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> to the print of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s paws.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cat</ENAMEX>'s-tail , also timothy <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX>, was a name formerly
given because the shape of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass flowerhead</ENAMEX> resembles
that caudal appendage.

            Male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> will know what <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s hair is (or

down on the face of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youths</ENAMEX> before the beard grows.

            It is worthwhile pointing out that this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> has suffered
from some of these affictions (especially <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Convalescence</ENAMEX>)
at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time or another (and the attacks
seem to return with increasing frequency as the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> dwindle down).  Still, most have happily been
kept at bay: we still have not suffered from, among
others, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evil</ENAMEX>, insufficient flow of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitus</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ] dance, deafness, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt rheum</ENAMEX>; the others,
including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">felons</ENAMEX>, come and go and must be regarded
as natural reflections of everyday life.  Etymologically,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> cannot suffer from hysteria, and most
older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are unlikely to get colic.

            Such amusements aside, one might think that a
careful review of an older <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dictionary</ENAMEX> might reveal
something about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the language at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of publication; but that is not necessarily true
for old dictionaries any more than it is for new ones.
To be sure, there are oddments and peculiarities that
can be spotted: in the case of the subject work, one
cannot help finding the definition of electricity a
source of entertainment:


the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> of a very subtile fluid.

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> may be surprised to learn that there is, effectively,
no definition in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX> Unabridged
for electricity : where one would expect to
find the main definition appear cross references to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electric</ENAMEX> charge and electric current , neither of which
offers a definition akin to the one we all know to
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sought.  The problem is, of course, that
while our understanding of the behavior of electricity
has improved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last century</TIMEX> or so, we know
little more about its basic nature than we did before.

            Like modern dictionaries, dictionaries prepared
in the past contain entries considered important by
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>, either for personal reasons--and there
is nothing much criticizable in following a personal
opinion if it is that of a qualified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX>--or because
a given word had become traditional in the
contemporary cultural context.  Thus, for instance,
we can readily understand retaining a definition for
awful striking awe, but few would agree that that
was either the dominant sense (or even a common
sense) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1880s</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>; yet no other definition
is provided.  It must be remembered that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX> in hand contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 32,000</NUMEX> words and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phrases</ENAMEX>, which means that it is half the size of the
average mass-market paperback <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> sold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
It therefore carries a surprising number of obsolete
and archaic words, and it is difficult to tell
whether they are in because they were common in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX> spoken in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midwest</ENAMEX>, or simply carelessly retained from an earlier
dictionary which was not properly edited.  For
one thing, certain <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">spellings</ENAMEX> are retained, but
those might have been left over from pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>
spelling reform: endeavour, moulding, humour; enamelling;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fulfil</ENAMEX> .  But esophagus not oesophagus , etc.

            A large number of words that do not occur in
common speech and writing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> are listed; some
have been selected here (omitting pronunciation and
part of speech) with comments based on checking in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX> , which, it must be
noted, classed the words at about the time of publication
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chicago Tribune Pronouncing Dictionary :</ENAMEX>

            There are other curiosities in this book.  For example,
the entry


affusion, act of pouring upon.

            

            By contrast, here is the pertinent definition from the
OED :


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Med</ENAMEX>.  A remedy in fevers, consisting in pouring on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> a quantity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, varying in temperature
according to his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, but usually from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50¬∞</NUMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60¬∞</NUMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">70¬∞ Fahr</ENAMEX>.  Also fig.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">1803 W. TAYLOR</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ann</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rev.  1</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">273</NUMEX> From the eruptive fever of democratic
effervescence, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> recover by slight and temperate
affusions of concession.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">1844 T. GRAHAM Dom</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Med</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">752</NUMEX> In very acute attacks
of yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fever</ENAMEX>...we resort to the use of purgatives,
and the cold affusion.

            

            At alcahest , the definition reads, the universal solvent;
at alkahest , which is merely a spelling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variant</ENAMEX>,
the definition is, a pretended universal solvent,
from which one might conclude that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is the
real thing.

            On pronunciation, [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ak-ses</ENAMEX>'] is given as the preferred
form, while it is the secondary form in other
dictionaries of the period.  Huge is shown as [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">h≈´j</ENAMEX>] but
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">humour</ENAMEX> is pronounced [≈´'mur]; adagio is shown as [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">adƒÅ'jƒì-≈ç</ENAMEX>],
and accompany and similarly spelled words
are shown with geminate consonants, e.g., [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">akkum'pa-ne</ENAMEX>].

            The conclusion is that such books seldom have
anything to teach us except in the most general way
about the way the language was used in another
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, partly owing to the lack of sophistication of
their compilers, partly to their conservatism, which
tempts them to include terms and definitions that
are no longer current.  Such entries must be retained
for they are encountered in reading.  Some conservative
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionaries</ENAMEX> published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier in the 20th century</TIMEX>
listed a huge number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scotticisms</ENAMEX> on the (justifiable)
grounds that they would be useful in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reading Burns</ENAMEX>; but most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> editions containing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burns</ENAMEX>'s poetry later on supplied <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glosses</ENAMEX>, so an ancillary
reference proved unnecessary.  With all the dialects
and long-lived <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of English <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lexicographer</ENAMEX> risks inaccuracy in labeling a word,
phrase, or sense obsolete or archaic : there is sure to
be someone who speaks a form of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in which
the expression is extant.  For another thing, we must
pay close attention to historical information--not
about the language, but about the culture.  For instance,
just because we now know that the alkahest
(or alcahest ), phlogiston , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">philosopher</ENAMEX>'s stone
do not exist, they must still be listed in dictionaries,
just as the words for abstract notions like honesty,
integrity, beauty, truth , and so forth have a place.

         
         
            
               Logophobia
            

            Under the headline, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Plaintiff faints</ENAMEX> at mention of
sex, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Maclntyre</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Times</ENAMEX> correspondent in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, reported [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 March 1994</TIMEX>] about a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who suffers from conversion hysteria ,
a fortunately rare affliction in which the individual
collapses unconscious at the mention of a word or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of words.  Shades of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Manchurian Candidate</ENAMEX>
!  She was sitting in a chair and immediately
fell out when sex was mentioned, according to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">woman</ENAMEX>'s defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX>.

            It is not a subject for flippancy, one must concede,
especially in the circumstances surrounding
the case.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evidently</ENAMEX>, a neighbor learned of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">woman</ENAMEX>'s condition, whispered the word sex to her as
she was passing through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> of the apartment
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> where they live, whereupon she dropped,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unconscious</ENAMEX>, to the floor, and he sexually molested
her--presumably after moving her to a more private
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">venue</ENAMEX>.  The trial of the molester is becoming difficult
to prosecute, for every time the molestee is
called to testify, she faints, even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> so
much as spells the word s<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">-e-x</ENAMEX> .  How the event was
reported in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> instance is not revealed.  It
might be suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ameslan</ENAMEX> be employed or
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> be asked to demonstrate what took
place using dolls, as they do when asking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to
testify.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> may draw their own conclusions
and opinions on the subject; it wouldn't do for us to
comment.
         
         
            
               Have a nice day
            

            Even the less sensitive of us become irritated
with clich√©s after a while, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> often wishes that
Have a nice day had gone the way of Hi!  My name is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX> and I'll be your waiter <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bunny</ENAMEX>
Dip.  But it seems here to stay, and, on reflection,
merits comment.  It ill behooves us to criticize its
emptiness, for we all utter Good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, Good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>,
Goodby, How are you?, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Hello</ENAMEX> , and numerous
other salutational and valedictory remarks in the
course of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>.  It is likely that Good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> had its
origins in Have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a good day</TIMEX> , which is not very different
from Have a nice day , either in meaning or in
spirit.  Perhaps we may soon be hearing Nice day
(meaning Have a nice day, not, as it already does,
It is a nice day, to the latter of which our curmudgeonly
response is usually, Yes, if you like warm,
sunny<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">, breezy spring days</TIMEX>).

            
               Good day has taken on other connotations, depending
on its prosodic features (stress pattern).  A
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">straightforward Good day'</ENAMEX>, with little stress on good ,
is the neutral greeting; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>', with equal stress
and even a slight pause between the words, uttered
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">emphatically</ENAMEX>, is tantamount to dismissal; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G'dye</ENAMEX> is again the neutral expression on meeting
or parting.  Till something else comes along or we all
agree to go back to better established <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">clich√©s</ENAMEX>, we
might as well get used to Have a nice day and its
variant, (You) have a good one, now : the alternative
is to stay at home.
