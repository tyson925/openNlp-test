            Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> will probably regard the above as
a list of unrelated, more or less well-known
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words that have been selected at random,
but they will be wrong.  Appearances are often deceiving
and this is a case in point.  The words are not
unrelated and they have not been selected at random,
for they all have one thing very much in common,
namely, they are all Hindi loanwords.  To be
sure, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> is not the ultimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> in all cases, but
it was at least the final stopping point in the journey
of the words into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> lexicon.  (In this article,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> is used to cover loanwords which etymologists
attribute to either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hindi</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urdu</ENAMEX>.  The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are
basically the same language, except that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> is
written in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Devanagari</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urdu</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> script.)  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> has, in fact, been a
more fruitful source of new words for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
lexicon than most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> realize, a not unnatural result
of the centuries of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> rule in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>.  All
Hindi loanwords in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, of course, are not as
well known or as frequently used as those listed
above; indeed, many are obscure in the extreme and
are probably never used in speech or encountered in
print by the overwhelming majority of English
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>.  Nonetheless, all are recognized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
lexicographers as being good English words.
Thus, all those cited in this article are to be found as
separate entries in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s Third New International
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX> .

            Not all the words that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> has borrowed
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> are pure <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hindi</ENAMEX>; that is, some words
passed through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> en route to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> but their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ultimate</ENAMEX> origins lie elsewhere.  For example, out of a
sampling of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">481 Hindi loanwords</NUMEX> (that is, I know, an
odd number for a sampling of any kind, but it happens
to be the number I had carded as of the moment
I began writing this article), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">167</NUMEX> were borrowed
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanskrit</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another four</NUMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pakrit</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Persian</ENAMEX> was the ultimate source of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">55</NUMEX> (the latter figure includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> words that
entered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hindi</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian</ENAMEX> and are combinations of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>).  Begum `high-ranking
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Muslim lady</ENAMEX>' derives ultimately from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Turkic</ENAMEX>,
while cowrie `a type of sea shell' comes from Tamil
or Malayalam kavati via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> kauri or kaudi .  Two
Hindi loanwords have their origin in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>: ayah
`native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maid</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX>,' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> version of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX>
aia , and pulton or pultun `infantry regiment,'
adapted from paltan , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> version of English
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">battalion</ENAMEX> .

            Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loanwords</ENAMEX> entered <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> directly,
but a few first passed through the filter of another
language.  Baiza `small copper coin of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oman</ENAMEX>,' for
example, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> paisa .  Datura
`type of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>' and vanda `variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orchid</ENAMEX>'
reached English via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Latin</ENAMEX>; gavial `large crocodile,'
from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Hindi ghariyal</NUMEX> ) via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>; and mohar
`silver coin of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX>' via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nepalese</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portuguese</ENAMEX> was
the immediate source of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> words (the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>,
it will be recalled, were also in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several centuries</TIMEX>,
losing their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Goa</ENAMEX> only in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX>): copra , from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> khopra via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malayalam</ENAMEX> koppara;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">machila</ENAMEX> or machilla `hammock slung from a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pole</ENAMEX>,' from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Hindi manzil</NUMEX> (borrowed unchanged from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>) via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tamil</ENAMEX> macil or mancil; tael `<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of
weight,' from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Hindi tola</NUMEX> (adapted from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Sanskrit tula</NUMEX> )
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">via Malay</ENAMEX> tahil ; and jambolan `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Java plum,' the English</ENAMEX>
version of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> jambulao , from Hindi
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jambul</ENAMEX> .

            Some of the words in my sampling may or may
not be Hindi loanwords; that is, etymologists are uncertain
whether they are properly attributable to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> or some other language of the subcontinent.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dhoni</ENAMEX> or doni `fishing or coastal trading vessel,' for
example, may have entered <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi, Marathi</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kanarese</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canarese</ENAMEX>), or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telugu</ENAMEX>; dinghy
`small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>' from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hindi</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bengali</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kathiawari `</ENAMEX>breed
of horses' from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hindi</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gujurati</ENAMEX>; khuskhus `aromatic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vetiver</ENAMEX>' from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hindi</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian</ENAMEX>; kirpan
`<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sikh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dagger</ENAMEX>' from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hindi</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Punjabi</ENAMEX>; and nagkasser
or nagkesar `<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>'. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">patel</ENAMEX> `village <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">headman</ENAMEX>' and
pindari `<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> mercenary,' from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hindi</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marathi</ENAMEX>.

            Several of the loanwords in my sampling are actually
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hybrids</ENAMEX>; that is, they include elements both
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> and from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> other languages.
Memsahib `term of respect for a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>,' for
example, derives from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English ma'am</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> sahib
`sir, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX>,' a word borrowed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>; boxwallah `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peddler</ENAMEX>' combines <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> box
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> wallah `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in charge of a particular
thing'; chotapeg `<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-sized drink' unites <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hindi</ENAMEX> chota
`little, small' and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> peg (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> slang
since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 1864</TIMEX> for a drink, especially of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brandy</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda water</ENAMEX>); and shroffage `<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> charged
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shroffing</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">combines</ENAMEX> shroff (an adaptation of Hindi
saraf `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX>, money-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lender</ENAMEX>,' a word borrowed from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> suffix - age .  Combinations of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> include:


a) balaghat `tableland above a mountain pass,'
from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> bala `above' and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> ghat `pass;
passage or stairway descending to a river';

b) bhumidar `<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">landowner</ENAMEX> having full title,' from
Hindi bhumi `<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>, land' and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> dar
`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX>';

c) chokidar `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchman</ENAMEX>,' from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> cauki `police
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">station</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian dar</ENAMEX>; and

d) kalaazar `disease also known as dumdum fever,'
from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kala `black</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> azar
`disease.'

            

            
               Mussalchee `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">torchbearer</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">combines</ENAMEX> mussal `torch,
usually of oilsoaked rags,' adapted from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> masal
or mashal , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> version of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> mash'al , and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkic</ENAMEX> - ci (or chi, ji ), a suffix denoting an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>.

            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loanwords</ENAMEX> are simply transliterations
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> originals.  But since different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
have different ideas about how the Devanagari
and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> alphabets should be transliterated,
in many cases there is no single ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù way to
spell a specific word and, instead, dictionaries offer
several--sometimes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as six</NUMEX>--acceptable variant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spellings</ENAMEX>.  Burka `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loose woman</ENAMEX>'s garment covering
entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>,' for example, can also be spelled
bourka, burkha, burga, burqa , or bourkha , while mahua
`type of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>' can also be spelled mahwa ,
mohwa, mowha, mowra , or mowrah .  Loanwords
with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> recognized spellings include: chador,
chadar, chuddar, chudder, chaddar `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s cloth
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> covering'; mahseer, mahsir, mahsur, mahaseer,
mahasir `freshwater <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>'; mali, mallee, mallie, mally,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molly</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a gardening <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caste</ENAMEX>'; naik, naig,
naique, naigue, nayak `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corporal</ENAMEX>'; and tussah,
tusseh, tusser, tussor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tussur `tan silk</ENAMEX>; also the silkworm
producing it.' Chukker `period of polo play,'
dhoti `loincloth,' dinghy, ganja `cannabis used for
smoking,' khidmatgar `male waiter,' khuskhus,
kutcha `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX>, imperfect,' <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">myna `species</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>,'
puggaree `blight turban, scarf,' raggee `finger millet,'
ryotwar `system of collecting land rents or taxes,'
sambar `type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>,' and zamindari `system of land
holding' each have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other acceptable spellings.
My sampling contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about fifty</NUMEX> other words that
have either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> variant spellings each.

            Although most loanwords differ in form somewhat
from their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindi</ENAMEX> antecedents, the changes are
largely minor orthographic ones, as the substitution
of ch, gh , and sh for an original c, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> , or s , etc.  Thus,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English</ENAMEX> has champac `<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>' instead of campak, gharry
`horse-drawn <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cab</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX>' instead of gari, darshan
`a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blessing</ENAMEX>' instead of darsan .  A change
of vowels or a doubling of a consonant is also not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infrequent</ENAMEX>, thus giving <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> kunkur `variety of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limestone'</ENAMEX> in lieu of kankar, mulmul `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">muslin</ENAMEX>' in lieu
of malmal, muggar `kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crocodile</ENAMEX>' in lieu of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magar</ENAMEX> .  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Dozens</NUMEX> of similar examples could be cited.
On the other hand, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loanwords</ENAMEX> have undergone
radical changes.  Few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, I hazard, would be
likely, upon seeing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> terms bilayati, bajara,
bajra, kaawch, pani , and rasaut , to cite only a few, to
discern therein the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> blighty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Indian</ENAMEX>
slang for `<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>,' brinjarry `traveling
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX>,' budgerow `large, keelless
barge,' cowage `tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vine</ENAMEX>,' pawnee `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>' and
rusot `<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> extract.'  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> other good examples are
Juggernaut `unstoppable destructive force: or object,'
which derives from jagannath , and kedgeree
`cooked dish of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, lentils, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX>,' which derives
from khicri or khicari .  The familiar cot and
dungaree are close to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hindi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pronunciation</ENAMEX>, though not in spelling; they derive,
respectively, from khat and dungri .

            In the case of some loanwords, there has been a
change in both form and meaning.  Bandanna , for
example, comes from bandhu , which denotes a way
of dyeing cloth, while bungalow comes from bangla ,
an adjective meaning `of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bengal</ENAMEX>.'  Other loanwords
which have acquired changed meanings include chitra
`<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">axis deer</ENAMEX>,' from citra `spotted'; hathi `gray,' from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hathi `elephant</ENAMEX>'; pukka `genuine, reliable, good,'
from pakka `cooked, ripe, mature'; puttee `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX>'s
legging,' from patti `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bandage</ENAMEX>'; pyke `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilian</ENAMEX> at
whose expense a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX> is treated,' from payik `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messenger</ENAMEX>';
and toddy `type of hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX>,' from tari `palmyra
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">palm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX>.'  These are only a few of the many
examples available.

            Some single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> words have given rise to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
different loanwords.  Bandar `rhesus <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX>' and
bondar `palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">civet</ENAMEX>,' for example, both derive from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bada</ENAMEX> or badar <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">`monkey</ENAMEX>,' while baniya `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchant</ENAMEX>' is
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> antecedent of both banyan `<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>' and bunnia
`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a merchant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">caste</ENAMEX>.'  Other examples
of the same phenomenon include: chokey `customs
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">station</ENAMEX>' and chowk `marketplace,' from cauki `marketplace';
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mulmul</ENAMEX> (see above) and mull `soft thin
muslin,' from malmal (see above); pandit `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> held in high respect' and pundit `very learned;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authoritative commentator</ENAMEX>,' from pandit `wise,
learned'; and numdah `thick felt rug' and numnah
`felt or sheepskin saddle pad,' from namda `carpet,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rug</ENAMEX>.'  Again, numerous other examples could be
cited.

            As the examples cited above make clear, Hindi
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loanwords</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> relate to a wide variety of subjects.

            snake oil


            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> was drilled
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1859</TIMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin L. Drake</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Titusville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> named for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Titus</ENAMEX>, who settled
it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1796</TIMEX> (and wanted to call it <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edinburgh</ENAMEX>).
Before oil was actively sought, it seeped out of the
ground in various parts of the world...

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúHere</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Oil Creek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> skimmed the
surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> off the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> for domestic uses, and white
settlers bottled it for medicinal purposes and called
it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seneca Oil</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            Was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seneca Oil</ENAMEX> the origin of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snake oil</ENAMEX> ?

         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World of Abbreviations</ENAMEX> and Acronyms



            I have traveled throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, but nowhere have I found
more abbreviations and acronyms in use than in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>, particularly in the medical field.  In the small
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> where I teach and practice hematology
and oncology, I frequently struggle to decode
the abbreviations and acronyms used by house
staff and medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>.  While this process is
frustrating at times, certain abbreviations and acronyms
add humor to the atmosphere of busy and
stressful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> medical practice.  For example,
while we often say that a patient needs lots of TLC
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúTender Loving Care</ENAMEX>,' at times we end up seeing the
result of another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TLC</ENAMEX> --`<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Total Lack of Concern</ENAMEX>.'
Many of us, including me, use WNL for `Within Normal
Limits' to describe the results of various x-ray
and laboratory tests; however, at times we find this
may well mean `We Never Looked.' When NMR
`<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</ENAMEX>,' which is now better
referred to as MRI `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Magnetic Resonance Imaging</ENAMEX>,'
was first introduced to the medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>,
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer advocates</ENAMEX> and insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,
fearing the escalating health-care costs associated
with this expensive diagnostic procedure, thought a
better translation would be `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No More Radiologists</ENAMEX>.'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG `Diagnosis Related Group</ENAMEX>,' the term <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uncle</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX> uses to describe prospective payment to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>,
could mean `<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Damned Regulatory Government</ENAMEX>'
to the medical profession or `<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">De</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">The</ENAMEX>] Revenues
Gone' to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital administration</ENAMEX>.

            For those of us in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>, we all carry a title
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.D</ENAMEX> .  `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Doctor of Medicine</ENAMEX>.'  When I was drafted into
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Army</ENAMEX> as a Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officer</ENAMEX>, my title was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúDal Yoo, M.D., U.S.A.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Army)‚Äù</ENAMEX> and I
recall my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Master Sergeant</ENAMEX>'s morbid joke that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">M.D.</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.A.</ENAMEX> could stand for `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Many Die and U Shall Also</ENAMEX>.'
Speaking of various titles, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.s</ENAMEX> are not the only
ones who get the bad names.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B.S.</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bachelor of Science</ENAMEX>'
could well mean `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bullshit</ENAMEX>'; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.S.</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">More of the</ENAMEX>
Same,' and Ph.D. `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pile Higher and Deeper</ENAMEX>,' etc.

            In the field of medical laboratory testing, you
may remember a test called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIA</ENAMEX> for detecting
abnormal macroglobulin in the serum.  The test is
performed by putting a drop of serum into distilled
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, producing a grossly visible white precipitate
in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waldenstrom</ENAMEX>'s macroglobulinemia
and other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dysproteinemic disorders</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walden</ENAMEX>-strom
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years ago</TIMEX> told me that he had an opportunity
to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sia</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> who first
introduced this simple bedside technique to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>.
However, when I was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX>, this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIA</ENAMEX> test was labeled as `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Serum In Aqua</ENAMEX>.'  Another
example comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIP</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vasoactive Intestinal Poly</ENAMEX>-peptide.'
This assay was quite variable from laboratory
to laboratory when first introduced; thus it
meant `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Very Inconsistent Polypeptide</ENAMEX>' to some of
the gastroenterologists and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeons</ENAMEX> who were pondering
the possibility of pancreatic surgery in patients
with high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIP</ENAMEX> .

            These abbreviations and acronyms are generating
laughter in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> life as well as in the medical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>.  Some time ago, I heard that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s budget proposal was DOA `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dead On Arrival</ENAMEX>'
on the congressional floor.  However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s interpretation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOA</ENAMEX> was `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Defining Opportunity</ENAMEX>
for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.'  More recently, during the war
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf</ENAMEX> we saw both pro- and anti-war demonstrations,
thus generating <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">SMASH `Students Mobilized</ENAMEX>
Against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX>,' as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SCUD</ENAMEX>
`<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sadly Confused Unpatriotic Demonstrators</ENAMEX>.'  At
times abbreviations or acronyms get upside-down as
well as backward meanings.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX>'s
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, when inflation was sky high, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> used
the slogan WIN `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Whip Inflation Now</ENAMEX>'; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>
turned the WIN button upside down, making it NIM
`<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No Immediate Miracle</ENAMEX>.'  For the backward example,
I saw the sign for DAM which is supposed to
represent `<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mothers Against Dyslexia</ENAMEX>.'

            When I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> to plan my future
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postgraduate</ENAMEX> training, a local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">acquaintance</ENAMEX> gave
me a quick <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> tour which included the worldfamous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philadelphia Museum of Art</ENAMEX>.  The windows
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> gave some nice views of downtown
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>.  The visit was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early summer</TIMEX> when
ongoing road <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pavement</ENAMEX> work was generating strong
smells.  From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> window we could see a
neon sign with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSFS</ENAMEX> in bright letters on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the
high-rise downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>.  The letters stood for
`<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philadelphia Savings Fund Society</ENAMEX>' but on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX> I
told my local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> that they stood, more appropriately,
for `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Philadelphia Smells Funny Sometimes</ENAMEX>.'
However, I later fell in love with this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of brotherly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">love</ENAMEX>, not only for its excellent medical training
but also for its rich metropolitan atmosphere.

            Speaking of smells, we have the organization
called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NOSE</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> suburban area
which, as you may have guessed, stands for `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Neighbors</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stench Elimination</ENAMEX>.'  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOSE</ENAMEX> is
fighting for the beautification of residential housing
districts.  Like everything else, the meaning of certain
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abbreviations</ENAMEX> or acronyms could vary depending
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Belgian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airline</ENAMEX> called
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SABENA</ENAMEX> could stand for `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Such A Bad Experience</ENAMEX>--
Never Again' but also could mean `Such a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Beautiful</ENAMEX>
Experience--<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Never Alone</ENAMEX>.'  Indeed we do not seem
to be able to get away from numerous abbreviations
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acronyms</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> of our lives because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>,
magazines, and TV newscasts love to come
up with new and innovative ones.  The latest scandal
of the television <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ministry</ENAMEX> concerns the organization
known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTL</ENAMEX> , which is supposed to stand for `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Praise</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX>' or `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">People That Love'</ENAMEX>; others think it
means `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pass The Loot</ENAMEX>.'  In this era of the litigationprone
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX>, including the high rate of malpractice
suits, I noted an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> called, HALT `Help
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abolish Legal Tyranny</ENAMEX>.' I welcome any means of
bringing laughter into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bedside medicine</ENAMEX>, which we
all think of as the last place where one could ever
find any decent humor.  When the medical practice
gets tough, particularly for those truly complicated
cases where I have no idea what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> has, I
apply my favorite of all the abbreviations, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOK</ENAMEX> syndrome
`<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">God Only Knows</ENAMEX>.'

            Once again the myth of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>-replacing-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>-by-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-vote
has surfaced, this time in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pages of VERBATIM</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVII</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:21</TIMEX>].  The myth began its
life in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-19th century</TIMEX> histories attempting to document
the contributions of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
culture and history.  But it is no more than a myth.

            There was a language-related vote that may be
the ultimate source of the myth, but that vote had
nothing to do with choosing an official language.  It
did not take place in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1776</TIMEX>, as is often maintained,
but on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 13, 1795</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Representatives</ENAMEX>
debated a proposal, not to give German
any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> status, but merely to print copies of the
federal laws in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  An ad hoc
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committee</ENAMEX> reported favorably on the proposal, but
during the debate a motion to adjourn failed by one
vote.  The failure of the motion to adjourn probably
represents a vote of no confidence in the committee
report.  After some further debate, which focused
not so much on translation as on the means by which
copies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> versions of the federal statutes
were to be furnished to the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, a new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committee</ENAMEX> was appointed to study the matter and
report to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>.  In the final vote, which took
place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month later</TIMEX>, the proposal for translation
was defeated.  The ayes and nays of the final vote are
not recorded.  It is from the close interim vote, not
on an actual bill but on adjournment, that the so-called
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúGerman vote‚Äù</ENAMEX> legend has been built.

            There is a further bit of embroidery to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">myth</ENAMEX>: it is often claimed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F. A. Muhlenberg</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speaker</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a prominent
assimilationist <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, stepped down to cast
the deciding vote damning <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> forever
to minority-language status (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muhlenberg</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detractors</ENAMEX>
go so far as to assert that his own German
was pretty incompetent).  But while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muhlenberg</ENAMEX>'s
voting record in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third Congress</ENAMEX> did not seem to
annoy his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX>, they did
react quite strongly when, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speaker</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourth</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, he stepped down and cast the deciding
negative vote against the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Jay Treaty</ENAMEX>.  This action
caused his brother-in-law to stab him, and it cost him
his congressional seat in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1796</TIMEX> election as well.
This significant tie-breaker soon became confused
with the earlier adjournment cliffhanger, conveniently
fleshing out the myth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> vote.

to adopt the metric system of weights and
measures as the official <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> standard.  These

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are frequently guilty of nonsense
about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> language, but it is regrettable to
see it spilling over into your pages.  Thus, in ‚ÄúRedundancy
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural Languages‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVII,3</NUMEX>], Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonner</ENAMEX> cites <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> nouns, Autoreparaturwerkstatt
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haupthandelsartikel</ENAMEX> , as being ‚Äúsimply
longer than they strictly need to be.‚Äù  These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are
alleged to mean `<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>' and `staple.'  But a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> is
not necessarily an auto repair workshop, and a principal
stock in trade is not necessarily a staple (except
in the loosest sense).  Actually, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> noun
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stapel</ENAMEX> is used much more precisely than its English
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX>, as in such terms as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabelstapler</ENAMEX> `forklift
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">truck</ENAMEX>' and, more poetically, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hochstapler</ENAMEX> `swindler.'
The immense combinative resources of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> language may lead to the creation of ponderous
nouns, but seldom to redundancies.

in translating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.  As an example
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> kind of difficulty that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translators</ENAMEX> face,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coindreau</ENAMEX> cited the title of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faulkner</ENAMEX>'s The Unvanquished
and asked, ‚ÄúIs it plural or singular?  Masculine
or feminine?‚Äù  He said that the translators, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. N.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raimbault</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.P. Gorce</ENAMEX>, had put those questions
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faulkner</ENAMEX>, who only laughed.  Knowing that any of
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> possibilities would considerably narrow the
range of suggestion in the original, but helpless,
they settled for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L'Invaincu .</ENAMEX>





         
         


            It is understandable that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel Vercambre</ENAMEX>
would find it disconcerting to run into blue jaundice
in his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Welsh dictionary [‚ÄúInstant Welsh</ENAMEX>,‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>].  The term seems to contradict itself, but at
least it is to be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> and means `cyanosis.'
My own surprising encounter with color occurred
when, in a report on the restoration of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sistine Chapel</ENAMEX>, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>--an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>,
speaking in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>--said that they had used a preparation
that contained whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>, ‚Äúincluding the
red.‚Äù  I was, of course, appalled to think that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo</ENAMEX>'s
work was in the hands of someone who
sees yolks as red.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curiosity</ENAMEX> led me to consult an
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionary</ENAMEX>, where I found for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">yolk</ENAMEX> , `rosso
d'uovo.'  So as to leave no possible doubt, I checked
on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rosso</ENAMEX> and got `red,' as in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">il mar Rosso</ENAMEX> .  Can you
help explain that one, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vercambre</ENAMEX>?





         
         


            I recently asked my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maureen</ENAMEX>, an experienced
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, to review some material I had written
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>.  When the review was completed,
our conversation led to the following addition to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English language</ENAMEX>, which we would be pleased to
share with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>'S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>:


lallaperuser `a world-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>.'

            






         
         


            Upon reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adrian Room</ENAMEX>'s ‚ÄúDon't Get Your
Titles in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Twist‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>], I was happily surprised to
see reference made to the tiny, misspelled, but spellbinding
novel by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daisy Ashford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Young Visiters</ENAMEX> .
I have been an ardent admirer of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúMiss Daisy‚</ENAMEX>Äù ever
since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1928</TIMEX>, when I had the good fortune to be cast
in a dramatization of her novel, presented at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strand Theatre</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January of that year</TIMEX>.  It
was a special matinee, under the auspices of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stage Society</ENAMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> drawn exclusively from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of prominent theatrical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.  We were
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all between the ages of seven</TIMEX> and fifteen, which was
entirely appropriate, since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss Ashford</ENAMEX> had written
her novel at the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>.

            My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Truex</ENAMEX>, had been appearing in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West End</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> and was currently
starring in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Morning</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>! , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.G.</ENAMEX>
Wodehouse, thereby assuring my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX> and
me of an invitation to audition for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Whale</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whale</ENAMEX> was a brilliant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of the theater who wore
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> hats on this occasion, donating his services as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX>, and scenic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX>.  After the
auditions it was announced that I had been cast as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wales</ENAMEX> (the future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edward</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VII</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jim</ENAMEX>
was to play an old crony of his, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Earl</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clincham</ENAMEX>.
This was pretty exciting stuff!

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> proclaimed that ‚ÄúMiss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daisy Ashford</ENAMEX>'s
famous story, dramatized by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss Margaret</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mackenzie</ENAMEX> and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Norman</ENAMEX>, will be acted
by the following promising juveniles....‚Äù  There
followed a list of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than thirty</TIMEX> names.  The leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> were played by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Casson</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sybil Thorndike</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Casson</ENAMEX>) as Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salteena</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy Hyson</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Hyson</ENAMEX>) as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ethel ‚ÄúMonticue</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Christopher</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ann Casson</ENAMEX>, read the passages which
linked up the various scenes.

            I still remember the enthusiastic reception we
got from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>; but, better still, I can quote
from the glowing review we got from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John Irvine</ENAMEX>,
the eminent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The London Observer</ENAMEX> ,
who observed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher ‚Äúdisplayed</ENAMEX> all the
signs that denote an accomplished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comedian</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  As
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irvine</ENAMEX> called her ‚Äúa very beautiful
little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> and, at the risk of turning her head, she has
the makings of a very good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  And our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ann Casson</ENAMEX>, ‚Äúread the passages with a clearness
of utterance that was remarkable.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Towards</ENAMEX> the end
of the review Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irvine</ENAMEX> added, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúMr</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Truex</ENAMEX>'s
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>, were extremely diverting
in their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parts</ENAMEX>; and I was greatly touched by the
spectacle of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Truex</ENAMEX>, in the part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wales</ENAMEX>, solemnly removing his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crown</ENAMEX> during the
singing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Anthem</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  I decided then
and there to go on the stage.

            
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young Visiters</ENAMEX> lent itself readily to dramatization,
except that one loses the special sort of
charm inherent in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daisy</ENAMEX>'s quaint spelling.  But there
are other things to charm one in a stage version.  We
all had the pleasure of getting to know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daisy</ENAMEX> a little
bit at rehearsals and felt very much at home with
her, which wasn't surprising, since she was only
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about eighteen</NUMEX> herself.

            I was totally entranced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy Hyson</ENAMEX> and,
before we had to return to school, I persuaded our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> to take us to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">circus</ENAMEX>.  There I had the
thrill of winning a canary by rolling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a penny</NUMEX> down a
slide into a tiny bull's-eye.  With a flourish, I presented
it to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy</ENAMEX>.  Soon after that, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> got a
good offer to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX>, and I didn't see
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy</ENAMEX> again until a number, of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years later</TIMEX> when
she came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> in a play titled Most of the
Game .  Well, sure enough, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irvine</ENAMEX> was right: she
was a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>--and a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX>!  But,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alas</ENAMEX>!, she was married.  She did, however, confide to
me that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúour‚Äù canary</ENAMEX> was still in good voice.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doubleday</ENAMEX> wisely reissued The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young</ENAMEX>
Visiters , and it got a rave review by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Friedman</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York Times</ENAMEX> .  He called it ‚Äúa tiny novel
that begs comparison with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giants</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Tolstoy's War</ENAMEX> and
Peace , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flaubert's Sentimental Education</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> in Love may be bigger, but The
Young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Visiters</ENAMEX> too manages to contain and display,
more gracefully than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giants</ENAMEX>, an entire civilization.‚Äù
He added that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daisy Ashford ‚Äúis</ENAMEX> as ambitious
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Eliot</ENAMEX> and as innovative as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gertrude Stein</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Virginia Woolf</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  Well, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beatrice Lillie</ENAMEX> used to
say, ‚ÄúYou could have knocked me over with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fender!‚Äù</ENAMEX>  I really had not thought about <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Young</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visiters</ENAMEX> in that context.  That is to say, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1928</TIMEX> we
budding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thespians</ENAMEX> looked on acting in the play as
simply a joyous lark.  We loved the story and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, but we had never heard of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flaubert</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tolstoy</ENAMEX>.  At this stage in my life I could see that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedman</ENAMEX> was on to something: I knew, for instance,
that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> suspected that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.M. Barrie</ENAMEX>, who
had written the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Introduction</ENAMEX>, had written the novel
himself, and I had sneered at that theory.  But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedman</ENAMEX>
went further than that.  He insisted that ‚ÄúNothing
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barrie</ENAMEX>'s fiction can match <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashford</ENAMEX>'s chefd'oeuvre....
But most of all, even though she
shows us a world of buffoons--for no one escapes--
she causes us to love them.‚Äù  And I say ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù to
that!




         
         


            Though my <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX> is rudimentary, I cannot
help commenting, as my eyes fall on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">page</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM XVII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonner</ENAMEX>'s statement, ‚ÄúChinese
has no notion of tense,‚Äù is erroneous.  As in the
case of the future tense in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, tense in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX>
is indicated by an auxiliary <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">verb</ENAMEX> or a particle, not by
inflection of the verb.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> would translate the Caesarean
Veni, video, vincam! into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> something
like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">`Wo laide</ENAMEX>, kan, yao desheng.'





         
         


            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bummel</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> river [‚ÄúDon't Get
Your Titles in a Twist!‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>]?  If so, neither the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rand McNally</ENAMEX> nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> atlas has noticed it.
Nor do the etymologies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Duden</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langenscheidt</ENAMEX> .
If my memory is reliable, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome</ENAMEX> was rhapsodizing
about the experiences of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> on a footloose
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bicycle</ENAMEX> tour.  Take away the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX>, and it is as
near to the meaning of ein <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bummel</ENAMEX> as one can get.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> usage is worth comparing with the obsolescent
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bummer</ENAMEX> and with bummle in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> dialect.  Could your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contributor</ENAMEX>, notwithstanding
his correct identification of the background
to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Three Men on the Bummel</ENAMEX> , be confusing it with
the better-known <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Three Men in a Boat</ENAMEX> , where the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scenery</ENAMEX> is decidedly fluvial?

            Both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> employ the definite
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> where the indefinite would be equally appropriate.
Might not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome</ENAMEX>, who knew <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> well
and spoke <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> fluently, have simply chosen the
slightly more forceful of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> alternative titles?





         
         
            [ In all fairness, it must be said that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Room</ENAMEX> wrote
as soon as he realized his slip in referring to the Bummel
as a river.--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX> .]
         
         


            We would really have to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schleppers</ENAMEX> (with a

to drag the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populace</ENAMEX>, me among them, from saying

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> cravenly caving in to some of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>
who lambasted him for having written, ‚ÄúWho are
you rooting for?‚Äù  When I wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Safire</ENAMEX> to ask
whether he could imagine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faulkner</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Hara</ENAMEX> sitting in the grandstand at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yankee Stadium</ENAMEX>,
hot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> (with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mustard</ENAMEX>) in hand, asking each
other, ‚ÄúWhom are you rooting for?‚Äù, he responded
with a form <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">postcard</ENAMEX> answering a question about the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">locution God Bless</ENAMEX> , one that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX> and I could
certainly get along without.

            Context is important.  I can imagine myself answering,
‚ÄúIt is I, (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord</ENAMEX>),‚Äù to a voice from a burning
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX>, but not to the good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of Chatauqua
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>.

must say that I wholeheartedly agree with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s
assessment of the awkward and often amusing
government translation.  The strange concoction of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grammar</ENAMEX> and syntax served up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide</ENAMEX> no

it was meant to benefit.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yiddish</ENAMEX> deserves better, and

            While no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> will be unhappy with a review
that begins, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äú The Surname Dictionary</ENAMEX> , in particular,
becomes the best available work on the subject,‚Äù
several points in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leslie Dunkling</ENAMEX>'s remarks on A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictionary of Surnames</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVII</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4:11</TIMEX>] require comment.

            He writes, ‚Äúthe awkward fact... is that a great
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will consult it in vain for information
about their own names.‚Äù  He is right that the dictionary
concentrates on the more frequent names
(though it is not limited to these), yet that is inevitable
in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> attempt at a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">pan-European</ENAMEX> dictionary.
Even so, the book contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">almost seventy thousand</NUMEX>
family names, which is nothing to sneeze at in a pioneering
effort.  (Future editions will, of course,
contain more.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúThe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> say that if they came across reliable
information about rarer names, they wrote entries.
In other words, if someone else had done the
research in what appeared to be a scholarly way,
they took advantage of it.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  One</ENAMEX> should not think
that the book is a scissors-and-paste job.  The compilers
write, ‚Äú...the number of reliable reference
works [on family names] is remarkably small‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xlvii</ENAMEX>).  After mentioning these few, they conclude,
‚ÄúAt this point the list of honourable exceptions begins
to run out‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. xlviii</ENAMEX>).  Therefore, to compensate
for the scarcity of reliable secondary literature,
the compilers turned to many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>.  From the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> pages of personal acknowledgments (as opposed
to a mere <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pages of bibliography), it should be
clear that the dictionary rests largely on original research.
As ‚Äúspecial consultant‚Äù for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish</ENAMEX>
names, I can say that all of my explanations are original
with me.  (How the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> names were treated is
described in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúThe Jewish Family Names</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Surnames ,‚Äù Jewish Language Review</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7, 1987</TIMEX>, pp. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">139-46</TIMEX>.)

            Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dunkling</ENAMEX> has ‚Äúdoubts about how ordinary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of this dictionary will cope with its metalanguage,‚Äù
citing lines which contain several abbreviations
and technical terms.  With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">forty-one</NUMEX> pages of
Introduction and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pages devoted to the resolution
of abbreviations, the task is not as hard as he
makes it out to be.

            He writes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚Äúgenealogical</ENAMEX> information is occasionally
added..., but only when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> concerned
are `important' according to a very traditional
definition of that word.‚Äù  Yes, and that is
because genealogical information is most abundant
for such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>: what, for instance, is known about
the ancestry of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frankie Vaughan</ENAMEX>?  Also, if anyone
infers from later remarks in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dunkling</ENAMEX>'s review
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about ‚</NUMEX>Äúthe `noble' theme‚Äù) that only <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúnoble‚</ENAMEX>Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
are the subject of genealogical notes, that assumption
would be wrong: there are genealogical
vignettes for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Adams</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abraham Lincoln</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roosevelts</ENAMEX>, and many other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äúcommoners.</ENAMEX>‚Äù

            What I missed in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dunkling</ENAMEX>'s remarks is
mention of a major innovation in this dictionary:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nesting</ENAMEX>.  The family names are not listed as in a telephone
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directory</ENAMEX>, merely in alphabetical order, with
no articulation between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> entry and the next:
rather, if names are etymologically related to one
another, they are all listed under the same entry.
For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 285</NUMEX> names appear under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> .
Moreover, within each entry the names are broken
down according to form and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>--for example,
variants, cognates, diminutives, augmentatives,
patronymics, and patronymics from diminutives--
with further classification (according to language)
and comment.  A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">230</NUMEX>-page alphabetical index guides
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to the location of the names.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surnames</ENAMEX> is thus more like a thesaurus than an
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">alphabetical dictionary</ENAMEX>.





         
         


            The anecdote of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> who resented
the slur on her country [review of the Bloomsbury
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contemporary Slang</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVII</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:17</TIMEX>] reminded
me of an incident related to me by a friend
who taught <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> grade in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>-affiliated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>.
The story of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nativity</ENAMEX> was under discussion, and
the least sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> raised
her hand to ask, ‚ÄúWhat is a virgin?‚Äù

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> explained, in terms that she hoped
were appropriate to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>.  When she had
finished, the class Brain turned to the questioner and
smugly elucidated, ‚ÄúSo you see, you're a virgin.‚Äù

            ‚ÄúI am NOT! ‚Äù shrieked the outraged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight-year-old</TIMEX>.





         
         



            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> will recall with pleasure <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leo Rosten</ENAMEX>'s
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDUCATION OF H*Y</ENAMEX>*<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>*A*<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>*A*P*L*A*<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> , which appeared in the late 1930s
and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 40s</TIMEX> and which dealt with the amusing difficulties
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian Pale</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Settlement</ENAMEX> in coping with what we now call ‚ÄúEnglish
as a second <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  Rosten</ENAMEX>'s articles were
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">good-humored</ENAMEX>, and there was no intimation of negative
or hostile feeling toward an ethnic minority.  To
be sure, as it was fiction, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosten</ENAMEX> exaggerated a bit,
but the real-life <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were then extant, and I can
vouch for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> from my own experience.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, a certified public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountant</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, acquired a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan</ENAMEX>, an affable, outgoing insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX>
(pronounced SALE-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ess-mahn</ENAMEX>) whose accent reflected
his origins in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pale of Settlement</ENAMEX>, specifically in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minske Gebernyeh</ENAMEX>: Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan</ENAMEX> was an echt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Litvak</ENAMEX>.
Over and above the accent and intonation, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan</ENAMEX>
had a knack for transmogrifying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anguish</ENAMEX>
Languish into levels of meaning scarcely intended
by its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>.  I can cite <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> examples:

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> noontime Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> went
out to lunch from my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> on Devonshire
Street.  Within a few paces they encountered an acquaintance
of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan</ENAMEX>'s.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúMr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pincus,‚Äù</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan</ENAMEX>,
‚ÄúI want you should meet mine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountant</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Ober</ENAMEX>.  He's the finest figurehead in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
True enough, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> was a lightning calculator
and an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> at solving arithmetical puzzles.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> incident occurred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years later</TIMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1960</TIMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> went down to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> to
have his aortic aneurysm repaired by the distinguished
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael DeBakey</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> was a
great success, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of days</TIMEX> afterward my father
received a get-well card from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan</ENAMEX>.  The
picture was suitable enough, but the handwritten
message read, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúDear Harry</ENAMEX> - Hoping this will be
your last <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>....‚Äù

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, one rarely hears the echt Litvisch accent
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>.  Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> has largely died
off, and its progeny have become Americanized.  We
lose in color what we gain in homogeneity.

         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College Dictionary</ENAMEX>
            This dictionary might be said to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Random House Dictionary of the English Language</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">- College Edition</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>, of which I was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> (with the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart B. Flexner</ENAMEX> as managing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">great-grandson</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American College</ENAMEX>
Dictionary [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACD</ENAMEX> ], <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</TIMEX>, of which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarence L.</ENAMEX>
Barnhart was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> in chief.  There are, naturally,
many resemblances among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College</ENAMEX>
Edition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Revised Edition</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>, reviewed in Volume
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>, Number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> (pp. 172ff. in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">VERBATIM: Volumes</ENAMEX>
I & <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> ).  Before discussing the content, I may be allowed
a comment on the title.

            It is taken as given in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictionary business</ENAMEX> in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> that if a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dictionary bears</ENAMEX> the name ‚ÄúWebster‚Äù
it magically attracts sales far beyond those of a
dictionary that tries to rely for its success on quality
alone.  Compared to the soft-drink <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX>, that is
like saying that all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cola drinks</ENAMEX> ought to be called
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX>, though one would be legally enjoined
from doing so.  Not so with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> , for, owing to a
bit of folly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G. & C. Merriam Company</ENAMEX>,
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Springfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successors</ENAMEX> to the line
of dictionaries originated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noah Webster</ENAMEX>, published
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">synonym dictionary</ENAMEX> and called it a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Publishing Company</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX>, had the
wit to see that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merriam</ENAMEX> had, in effect, forsworn its
birthright, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noah</ENAMEX> had never published a synonym
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX>.  World called its <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary Webster's</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World ; Merriam</ENAMEX> sued and lost, confirming that
the appellation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> had fallen into the public
domain.  That is why virtually every <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> dictionary
of any shape, size, provenance, comprehensiveness,
quality, and lexicographic persuasion is
likely to be called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>.

            When I was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the reference department
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, at meetings
held with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett Cerf</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Klopfer</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lew Miller</ENAMEX>, sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>, we often touched on the
matter of what the new dictionary, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACD</ENAMEX> , was to be called.  It was pointed out then that
including the name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> in the title would be
likely to increase the sales by a measurable amount;
but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald</ENAMEX>, staunchly independent and
proud of the successes gained in the name of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> , would not hear of it.  It was I who proposed
the original title for the series of dictionaries
published from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX> onwards: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX> - Unabridged
Edition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College Edition, School Edition</ENAMEX> , and any
other subtitles that might come along.  From what I
know of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald</ENAMEX>, the decision to include
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> in the title of this book has probably set
them spinning in their graves.

            There is another aspect to this change: lamentably,
it emphasizes the abiding ignorance and gullibility
of the dictionary-buying public.  Anyone who
compares the multifarious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> bearing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> name cannot help observing the differences
in quality, quantity, and treatment offered: the name
has become meaningless, made inferior by its universal
application to virtually any kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>.

            While I am making general observations, I
might add, for the record, that my review of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX> edition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House College</ENAMEX> was not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">favourable</ENAMEX> because it was based on an examination of
the entries mentioned in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jess Stein</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preface</ENAMEX>: I had,
out of a feeling of sympathetic and loyal association
with the book's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX> edition, which still constituted
more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">ninety per cent</NUMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX> edition, selected
for analysis the words mentioned in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preface</ENAMEX>
on the premise that they were ‚Äúshowcase‚Äù entries
which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> were especially proud of.  As
it turned out, I was compelled to point out several
glaring errors in most of those entries, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jess Stein</ENAMEX>
never spoke to me again.  I must confess to being
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">displeased at Stein</ENAMEX>'s having removed my name from
the title page of a book only slightly changed from
its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> edition so that he could insert his own as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> in chief; but that was nothing new for him, as
he had deleted from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> editions of the ACD the
name of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> in chief, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarence L. Barnhart</ENAMEX>, to
insert his own.  So much for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De</ENAMEX> mortuis ...

            The present work contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180,000</NUMEX> entries,
fully <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> more than the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX> edition and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>
more than the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX> edition.  It would be a waste of
time to go through the editions noting the differences:
in most cases, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> followed the wise
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictum</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄúIf it ain't broke, don't fix it,‚Äù so little has
been done to the basic information in the original
edition.  The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX> edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ninth New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collegiate</ENAMEX> introduced the practice of giving, in the
etymologies, ‚Äúdates of earliest occurrence,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äù</ENAMEX> data
presumably derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX>
(for, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merriam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>
maintained a citation file for the tracking of new
words and senses, there was no point in duplicating
work done long ago by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>).  It is questionable
to what purpose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of dictionaries are to
put this information.  Naive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>--by far the majority--are
bound to misinterpret the dates as meaning
‚Äúwhen the word <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appeared in the language‚Äù
rather than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as ‚</NUMEX>Äúthe date of the earliest recorded evidence
found (at press time).<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Moreover</ENAMEX>, the date
cannot be associated with any particular definition,
so it is a bit misleading, for an entry like log , which
has several definitions, to show it as having entered
the language ‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Äú1350</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1400.‚</NUMEX>Äù In which sense?  And
what is to be made of the following?:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.  All numbers, from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> through twelve, are
listed as having entered <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English ‚Äúbefore 900‚</ENAMEX>Äù except
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>, for which ‚Äúbef. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1000‚</NUMEX>Äù is given.  Are we
to conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> got along without the
number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a hundred years</TIMEX> before someone,
perhaps feeling that ‚Äúsomething was missing,‚Äù
awoke <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one morning</TIMEX> to invent it?

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.  If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> looks up the ordinals, the following

            To be sure, there is nothing to justify the assumption
that the names of the numbers emerged in numerical
order from the primeval ooze of language; but
one might mistakenly conclude that the very first
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ordinal</ENAMEX> to be talked about in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> was eightieth ,
and this at a time when only a small percentage of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> had a life expectancy of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> that.
And it might be imagined that in giving directions to
get to one's hovel, one would say, ‚ÄúGo to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX>
hovel, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> is the next <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>,‚Äù for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> did not
come into being till <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixteenth century</TIMEX>.  One
would expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> to have signaled the truth
of the matter under <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Using This Dictionary</ENAMEX>, despite
the reluctance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to refer to such things.  But
no; here is the only comment:


when and how the word entered our language,
including the date that it <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appeared and its
source or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> in other languages

            

            The redundancy of when and the date that is confusing
enough; but to describe the date as when the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">word ‚Äúfirst</ENAMEX> appeared‚Äù is grossly misleading and inaccurate:
it is the date for the earliest written evidence
of the form.  That might seem a niggling
point, but dictionaries dwell (and thrive) on niggling
points, and such misstatements are unforgivable.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> would have been on safer ground had
they simply followed the wording in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Unabridged</ENAMEX> , to wit:


Most dates are expressed as a spread of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>,
giving the time within which the earliest document
containing the main entry was written or
published....  In many cases a term may have
existed in the spoken language long before it first
appeared in texts and, in any event, earlier written
evidence may exist that has not yet been discovered
or reported.  [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p. xxxiv</ENAMEX>]

            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> of college dictionaries in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> provides an outstanding textbook demonstration
of the principles of competitive free enterprise
at work and of what used to be called supply and
demand, but is now dubbed ‚Äúmarket <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  There
are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> major dictionaries of approximately the
same size competing for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> in the market.  It is
impossible to get an accurate figure for the total
market, which has been estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two million</NUMEX>
sales <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Publishers</ENAMEX> steadfastly refuse to reveal
their sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> because of the highly competitive
nature of the business, though it is generally acknowledged
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ninth New Collegiate</ENAMEX>
outsells its nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.
That nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX> is probably <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s New
World, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3rd Edition</ENAMEX> , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House College</ENAMEX>
(occupying a niche to be filled by the book under
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Heritage</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2nd Edition</ENAMEX> neck
and neck for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> place, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Webster's II New Riverside</ENAMEX>
bringing up the rear in this horserace.  These
are only guesses.

            The fierce competition among the dictionaries
results in what must be regarded as the greatest
book bargain in the history of publishing: taking the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Webster</ENAMEX>'s as a typical example, it
contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> (say, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5 million</NUMEX>
words) for which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> pays <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$18</NUMEX>, which works out to
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 139,000</NUMEX> words per dollar.  The average novel
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200,000</NUMEX> words for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25</NUMEX> works out at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,000</NUMEX> words
per dollar.  This is all the more astonishing when one
considers that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> maintain full-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX>
of skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lexicographers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> to keep their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionaries</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to date</TIMEX> by continuously monitoring
both the language and other kinds of data, like population
figures for geopolitical entries, death dates for
biographical entries, etc.  Consider, too, that the
quality of the paper, printing, and binding of such
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionaries</ENAMEX> is far superior to that of most other
books available, creating a cost per copy of about
$5.  Were all these factors taken into consideration in
normal pricing procedures in the industry, a college
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX> ought to retail for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $50</NUMEX> a copy.  One
is given to wonder how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> of other staple
consumer products manage to come up with
identical packaging (say, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> pint, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> fluidounces or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">pounds 13 ounces</NUMEX>) and identical pricing on supermarket
shelves without being in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">collusion</TIMEX>; even the
most cursory view of college dictionary publishing
at once reveals a most extraordinary example of the
workings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúmarket forces‚Äù</ENAMEX>: no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> wants to
be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to break the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20</NUMEX> barrier; the Indexed
edition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to touch that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mystical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX> dictionaries, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACD</ENAMEX> onward,
have always been known for their ease of use
and the clarity and understandability of the information
presented.  The book at hand supports that reputation.
Notwithstanding, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who use dictionaries
regularly become accustomed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, which
becomes their favorite for any number of reasons:
for purposes of utility and for philosophical reasons,
I prefer geographical and biographical entries to be
interfiled with other entries in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> alphabetical listing;
others prefer to have them separate.  To be sure,
if one is going to spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$18</NUMEX> or so, the dictionary
selected ought to be the most <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to date</TIMEX> and have
the largest number of entries, a bit of reasoning not
lost on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>.  Besides,
although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> seldom get into such detail in
the publicity about their dictionaries, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX> entries
a dictionary has, the more definitions it has.
That is not the truism it appears to be: as lexicographers
add entries, increasing the depth to which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lexicon</ENAMEX> is being probed, they must add definitions,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proportionally</ENAMEX> increasing the coverage of existing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entries</ENAMEX> (which often accomplishes little or nothing to
increase the entry count).

            Some dictionaries offer more information than
others about the entries they cover.  Thus, on average,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ninth New Collegiate</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Webster</ENAMEX>'s College contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least fifteen</NUMEX> per
cent more information per entry than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Heritage</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s New World.  (A copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II Riverside</ENAMEX> was not available for this comparison,
but is unlikely to come up to the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.)

            In all this talk about entries, it must be remembered
that the (accepted) practice in counting
dictionary entries in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> (and becoming the
standard in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.K.</ENAMEX> as well) is to count not only
headwords, or main entries, but inflected forms, variants,
changes in part of speech, run-on words (like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cunningly</ENAMEX> and cunningness under cunning ), and list
words (like reaccuse and reacquire ), which need no
definition.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary with</ENAMEX>, say, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150,000</NUMEX> entries is
likely to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than 80,000</NUMEX> headwords.

            Other desirable (or desired) features might influence
the purchase of a dictionary: according to a
comparison chart provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>, its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> illustrations; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ninth</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX>+; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s New World <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">650</NUMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> II
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riverside</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>+.  But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Heritage</ENAMEX> has
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX>.  (Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> have traditionally
had no illustrations at all.)

            I must admit that I have not been watching very
carefully the admittance of the naughty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> of the
language into dictionaries, but I am pleased to see
that their omission, so long a sop to the Cerberean
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">self-styled ‚Äúguardians‚Äù</ENAMEX> of the language, chiefly struthious
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">provincials</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bible Belt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, and--believe
it or not--<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, has ended.  I do object,
however, to the label <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vulgar</ENAMEX> given to such entries.  I
am sure that the label is the product of endless hours
of agonizing discussion, but I think they came up
with the wrong solution.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vulgar</ENAMEX> still carries the
strong denotation exemplified in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> (hence the
most frequently encountered) sense, ‚Äúcharacterized
by ignorance of or lack of good breeding or taste:
vulgar ostentation .‚Äù It has congeners, like vulgarian
‚Äúa vulgar person‚Äù; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">vulgarism ‚Äú 1</ENAMEX>. the state or quality
of being vulgar.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. something vulgar, as an act or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">expression‚Äù</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">vulgarize ‚Äú 1</ENAMEX>. to make vulgar or coarse;
lower; debase.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. ...popularize‚Äù; Vulgate ‚Äú... 4.
( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">l.c.</NUMEX> ) commonly used or accepted; common.‚Äù  The
problem in reviewing these sets of definitions is that
one can never be sure which definition of vulgar
ought to be applied to its use in the definitions of the
ancillary entries, for the word has a spectrum of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meanings</ENAMEX>.  I often think that it would not be untoward
for a dictionary to add to its entries for words
that also serve as labels (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colloquial</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Informal</ENAMEX>,
Slang , etc.) definitions that begin, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚ÄúAs</ENAMEX> used for labels
in this dictionary,...‚Äù In the event, a user
might well be confused about seeing the label Vulgar
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-letter words, when its definitions
seem to indicate that it means (merely) ‚Äúin bad
taste.‚Äù  My own choice for a label is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taboo</ENAMEX> , which is
incisively denotative.  Its main definition in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> reads, ‚Äúproscribed by society as improper
or unacceptable: taboo words ,‚Äù which I believe
is a lot closer to what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> were seeking
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">than Vulgar</ENAMEX> .

            I cannot conclude this review without commenting
on an element of dictionary marketing that
I think may be infra dig <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>, namely, the attempt
at hoopla.  Dictionaries are generally consistent
products of superior scholarship and care; at
this stage of the game, trying to change what Madison
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenue</ENAMEX> calls ‚Äúbrand loyalty‚Äù is like getting
someone who has been driving a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> all his life to
switch to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX>.  As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> know, that is
far from impossible, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> find it very
costly to effect the change.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Publishers</ENAMEX> grasp at anything
they think might catch the fancy of the dictionary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX> has come up touting its
treatment of entries like gal and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> , as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gal</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>,
I'll get my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> (`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX>') to type up this letter
right away .  The treatment is good and it might be
unique among the desk/college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX>--I
don't waste my time checking such trivia--but it is a
shame to see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> relying on such undignified
approaches.  On the other hand, pecunia non olet,
and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s market might need just such an incentive
to choose one dictionary over another.

            Another ploy has been to get major newspapers
and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> to acknowledge their reliance on a
particular dictionary to decide spelling (mainly) and,
I suppose, other language matters.  Unfortunately,
that leads to inconsistencies, for dictionaries report
what they find and are not intended as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of
prescriptive decisions.  Thus, a given dictionary
might hyphenate thick-skinned, thick-skulled , and
thick-witted but not thickheaded (e.g., the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">House</ENAMEX> 2nd <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unabridged</ENAMEX> ).  We know that the language
is inconsistent, and there can be nothing wrong in
reporting that fact: the dictionary merely reflects
the practice of the majority of written citations
available to its compilers.  But it must be said that
space is at a premium in these expensive books, and
if, say, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> citations are found for each of the
spellings thickwitted and thick-witted , one can be
sure that no lexicographer, thrifty of space, will display
the variant, whichever he perceives that to be.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> are not bound by such variety: neatness
is a virtue in publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>,
and books, and no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> who produced a style
book that required all such compounds to be consistently
spelled with or without a hyphen could be
subjected to criticism for yielding randomness to
logic.  I would be the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to stake anything
worthwhile on the statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">base</ENAMEX> used for determining
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúpreferred‚Äù spellings</ENAMEX> in dictionaries.  Thus,
when a dictionary is touted as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> used by such-and-such
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> should think back to
the number of times that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> has been cited in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIC ¬≥</ENAMEX>--seldom for the kinds of things that dictionaries
have much bearing on--and discount the claims
for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúadoption‚Äù</ENAMEX> as so much hype.  After all, the use of
a hyphen in adverb/adjective compounds is a matter
of style, which can be described in a rule: in position
before a noun, compounds with well --indeed, any
not ending in - ly --like well-heeled, well-known,
well-thought-out , are hyphenated, as in well-heeled
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gambler</ENAMEX>, well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, a well-thought-out
plan ; but when they are in predicative
position, as in Is she well heeled enough to sit in on
our game?, His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peccadillos</ENAMEX> are well known to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>,
The plan was well thought out , or, if they end in - ly
in any position, they are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words, as in That is
chiefly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> usage, this usage is chiefly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>.
Why, then list <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of hyphenated well -words?
With such a simple rule, would anyone need
to look such words up in a dictionary?

            To sum up, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>
is an excellent dictionary containing up-to-date
information about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> lexicon in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and, to a limited extent, elsewhere.  Indeed,
while I was writing this review an acquaintance
phoned to say that he had to replace all the
aging dictionaries in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and asked me to recommend
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX>.  I recommended this book
without hesitation or reservation.  It might be time
for you to switch from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cadillac</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Urdang</ENAMEX>
         
         
            Writing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spoken Word</ENAMEX>



            It suddenly struck me that, in all the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> I have
read and admired VERBATIM, I cannot recall an
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> on the language of public speaking--or, if
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> insists, oratory.  That being the case and
because I am a long-time professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speechwriter</ENAMEX>,
I feel it incumbent on me to remedy the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX>.

            I will concede that there may not be another
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> who is the least bit interested in speechwriting
per se --indeed, many might well disdain it because,
after all, it is one of the most lucrative forms
of writing.  But my guess is that many will be variously
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bemused</ENAMEX>, enchanted, and appalled by some of
the rules for good speech writing that run quite
counter to the rules for good writing for print.

            One widely acknowledged tenet for speechwriting
is to use simple and direct sentence structure
and to keep sentences as short as feasible.  There is
nothing remarkable about that; but the fact is that
sentence structure that is commonly accepted in
writing for print--that, in fact, is not only stylistically
impeccable but is virtually indispensable to expert
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>--can be taboo to speechwriters.

            I refer, for example, to something along the following
lines: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúAlthough the economy is in extremely
poor shape, my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> has been reporting excellent
financial results.‚Äù  That is what we speechwriting
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gurus</ENAMEX> call bass-ackward sentence structure.

            What is wrong with it?  The same thing, essentially,
that makes homophones horrendous no-nos in
speeches.  Whereas a document is read, a speech is
heard .  Yes, of course everyone knows that; but perhaps
thought is seldom given to its implications, of
which there are many.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homophones</ENAMEX> can be pure
poison in a speech.  A hapless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> might conceivably
spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several minutes</TIMEX> thinking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> is
discussing, say, roles , when he's actually discussing
rolls.  By the time the light of comprehension
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flashes</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listener</ENAMEX> might have lost the thread completely.

            As for convoluted and backside-to sentences,
the problem is that the point of a statement should
ordinarily come first.  If your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is reporting
excellent financial results, say so right out, then add
the impressive fact that this success has been
achieved despite a weak economy.  Serve the entr√©e
first, let the other courses follow.

            This is even true of the proper treatment of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modifiers</ENAMEX>.  Suppose one wants to brag that his company
has just completed a new, state-of-the-art,
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250-million</NUMEX>, completely computerized, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,000-foot-long</NUMEX>
reverberating furnace.  It should never be put
that way!  A long string of modifiers in advance of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noun</ENAMEX> is frustrating and confusing to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX>; they
want to know--right off--what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> is talking
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX>.  Good speech style calls for: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúMy company
just completed a new, state-of-the-art reverberating
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">furnace</ENAMEX>.  It cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250 million</NUMEX>.  It's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX>
feet long.  It's...etc.‚Äù

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> should get to the point, and get
there with maximum effectiveness, which is why signaling
is an indispensable technique in any speech-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>'s
bag of tricks.  While one would never write
‚ÄúWould you like to guess how much our new reverberating
furnace cost my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>?  No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">takers</ENAMEX>?
Well, listen carefully and I'll tell you...,‚Äù that is
excellent speechwriting style if only because challenging
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> in a sprightly conversational
manner tends to awaken snoozers and invigorate the
lethargic.  On a more positive note, there cannot be
any question of the value of alerting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> that
information worth listening to is forthcoming.

            While on that particular subject, how about restating
something important that has just been said?
Good form!  ‚ÄúThat furnace cost us <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250 million</NUMEX>.
That's right, I said a cool <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250 million</NUMEX>!‚Äù  Consider it
a rule that facts and figures that a serious reader
would reread in a printed text should be repeated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orally</ENAMEX> in a speech.  If he thinks--or looks--back
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over a few</NUMEX> of the points I have made, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> will
realize that speech texts--or at least important passages
within such texts--often are longer and wordier
than comparable writings for print, and necessarily
so.  After all, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> have to rely entirely on
audience comprehension through hearing, and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>'s words skitter by so swiftly!

            Can a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> reasonably expect his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> to
remember anything at all about that big furnace if
he has spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a few seconds</TIMEX> describing it?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speakers</ENAMEX> who want to impress their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> know
they have to telegraph key points and facts, then
announce them, then repeat, dramatize, explain,
and embellish.

            Finally,--and this may come as the most unkindest
cut of all to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purists</ENAMEX>--most speeches call for
use of conversational, colloquial <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  Most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>, on most speaking occasions, should sound
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">natural</ENAMEX>, not pedantic.  ‚ÄúWe're going to do it‚Äù is
more natural, and sounds more natural, than ‚ÄúWe
will do it.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Similarly</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄúWe've got to do it‚Äù is more
natural than ‚ÄúWe must do it.‚Äù  I would hazard a
guess that scores of words and phrases in virtually
every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">750 or so</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> speeches I have
written through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> would be criticized by
most high-school <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>.

            I have not given the whole story; there are
many other differences between optimal speechwriting
style and standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> usage, but I have
already taken up more than enough of your time.
And rest easy, Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalrymple</ENAMEX>, when I reedit speech
scripts for print publication, I always revert to good
old academically pure <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> usage.
         
         
            The (invariably) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Right</ENAMEX> Reverend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter W. Skeat</ENAMEX>




            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter W. Skeat</ENAMEX>, surely one of the greatest
linguists of all time and an outstanding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">innovator</ENAMEX> of
his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 19th century</TIMEX>), was often given to testy
replies when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Notes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queries</ENAMEX>
either disagreed with him or speculated on the etymology
of a word without having first looked it up in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skeat's</ENAMEX> works or, if the alphabetic section had
appeared, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX> .  He was
often nasty; but toward the latter part of the 1890s
the crust softened, and he mellowed a bit.  Some
contributors to learned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his day</TIMEX> frequently
submitted their suggestions with a hesitation
born of the fear of being flayed alive by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> in a contemptuous retort to be published in a
later issue.  In some cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skeat</ENAMEX>'s irritation stemmed
from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>'s failure either to read correspondence
that had been published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades earlier</TIMEX> or to
be intimately familiar with every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">last</NUMEX> syllable of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skeat's</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-volume work on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaucer</ENAMEX>.

            A poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Cordeaux</ENAMEX> was brazen
enough to suggest [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 27, 1893</TIMEX>] that stoat is from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Saxon</ENAMEX> steort , a tail.

            In the issue of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 10</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skeat</ENAMEX> pounced:


...A moment's reflection will show that stoat
and start are different words, just as coat and cart
or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">moat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mart</ENAMEX>.  That any one should for a moment
deem it possible to derive stoat from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.-S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">steort</ENAMEX> is a clear proof of the inability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
mind to conceive that etymology obeys fixed
laws.

            

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A year later</TIMEX>, he was still fuming [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 16, 1894</TIMEX>]:


No one seems to refer to the `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New English Dictionary</ENAMEX>'
or even to my `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Concise Dictionary</ENAMEX>'
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1890</TIMEX>).  It is of no consequence what the theories
are.  The fact is, that the word was spelt bane-fire
in the (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>) `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Catholicon Anglicum'</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1483</TIMEX>,
and is correctly explained in the same work as
`ignis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ossium</ENAMEX>' [`fire of bones'].

Notwithstanding this, all the old rubbish is repeated.
And we are told that it ‚Äúprobably
reaches us from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">baun</ENAMEX>, a beacon.‚Äù  But really
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> way of pronouncing baun is beacon;
and no living <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX> can pretend that we left
off saying beacon and began saying bone or bon.
...

I need hardly add, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 1894</TIMEX>, that there
is not a scrap of evidence in favour of any connexion
of bale-fire with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baldr</ENAMEX> or with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bel</ENAMEX> or with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baal</ENAMEX>.

            

            By the time he entered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his sixties</TIMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX>, Skeat
gave the impression that he was beginning to take
these matters a little less seriously:


...We might as well derive laundress from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gk</ENAMEX>. Leander, on the plea that the famous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hero</ENAMEX> was in the habit of swimming about to keep
himself clean.  This is no unfair parody of the desperate
pleas that are constantly being used in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúetymology</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

[8th <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. IX</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 21, 1896</TIMEX>]

            

            Lest one might be deceived into taking the preceding
to be a pleasantry, even as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late as 1909</TIMEX> (at seventy-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>),
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skeat</ENAMEX>'s contempt for those who knew
less than he was undiminished:


The word hawser has nothing whatever to do
with the verb to hoist; neither does the `<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">N.E.D.</ENAMEX>'
say that it has.  It correctly derives hawser from
the obsolete verb hawse, which had indeed the
sense of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúto hoist</ENAMEX>,‚Äù but is really a derivative, as
shown, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> altus...

But, as the `<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">N.E.D.</ENAMEX>' says, there was an early
confusion (of course, by popular etymology) with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scand</ENAMEX>.  hƒÅls, a neck, and its derivative hawsehole;
but we ought not to be misled by such a
specious bit of guesswork.  I speak feelingly, for I
was caught once in this particular trap, as shown
by the article on hawser in my `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Etymological Dictionary</ENAMEX>,'
for which I was promptly rebuked by
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wedgwood</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1882</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty-</TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years ago</TIMEX>);
and that is why I so fully recanted my heresy in
the `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Supplement';...</ENAMEX>  We are now invited to entangle
ourselves once more in the old meshes;
which I decline to do.

The verb to haul has nothing whatever to do
with either hawse or hawser.

            

            Like many intellectual bullies, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Skeat</ENAMEX> behaved
like the injured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> when caught in an error, making
it appear that it was the other--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who
was right--who had done wrong.  Like everyone, he
was himself occasionally wrong; in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX>, somewhat
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">begrudgingly</ENAMEX> and without direct reference to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
of the correspondence that confuted his earlier
surmise, he wrote to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. & Q.</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 27</TIMEX>] on the subject
of the expression the wrong end of the stick:

               
I have no doubt that the right explanation of
this phrase is that given at the latter reference
[<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 13</TIMEX>], and not the one suggested by myself,
which I beg leave to withdraw.  I remember now
‚Äúthe vulgar variant‚Äù of the phrase, which is
decisive.

            

            Sometimes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skeat</ENAMEX>'s tactic when confronted, either
with evidence of error--which occurred very
rarely indeed--or with a complaint about his overbearing
lack of tolerance of those who knew less
than he or had committed the unpardonable sin of
failing to have both his books and the latest fascicle
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> at hand, was to go all soft with humility.
Yet, he could not resist the barb in the tail:


I am merely a humble collector of facts, always
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endeavouring</ENAMEX> to find out <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> and quotations
for the instruction of others.  But I do not
advise any one to ignore my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>.

[<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ibid.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 18, '96</TIMEX>]

            

            It goes without saying that not all targets of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skeat</ENAMEX>'s wrath and contumely took his abuse lying
down, notwithstanding his correctness in most matters
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etymological</ENAMEX>.  Still, substantial contributors to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. & Q</ENAMEX> . took issue with what they perceived as a
rather high-handed attitude:


Are we to be shamed into speaking of ‚Äúphonetic
decay‚Äù because it pleases <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skeat</ENAMEX> to say
that ‚Äúwhenever a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> uses the word `corruption'
we may safely assume him to be guessing.  It
is the one word that is prized above all others by
those who prefer assertion to fact‚Äù?


            

            Here is Skeat fuming at a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX> who
had the gall to suggest that the origin of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ox -</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> , long a bone of etymological contention,
could be traced through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usk</ENAMEX> to a connection with
Gaelic uisque `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>,' as in uisquebaugh literally `water
of life,' from which we get <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">whiskey</ENAMEX> (etymologically
speaking):


...Not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only fifty years ago</TIMEX>, but even at the
present time, there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are ignorant
of the commonest principles of language, and refuse
to admit any phonetic laws or to take any
trouble to discover the historical sequence of
forms.  Their only idea is that ‚Äúetymology‚Äù is a
question of assumption and assertion, founded on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">guesswork</ENAMEX> and proclaimed by reiteration and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bluster</ENAMEX>.  They will never cease to repeat that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ox</ENAMEX>
is a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúcorruption‚Äù of Ouse, or Ose, or Usk</ENAMEX>, or
something else that is completely ridiculous.  The
more ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù there is in a guess, the deeper
is their conviction of its truth...

[<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Notes & Queries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">8th S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 18, '96</TIMEX>]

            

            In an issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. & Q</ENAMEX> . not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks later</TIMEX>, in
commenting on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX>'s plea for help in
tracing the form irpe , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skeat</ENAMEX> wrote:


[As to its origin,] there is nothing but to guess.

            

            He might be seen to have got his final comeuppance
at the hands of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX>, who
wrote at length as follows about the etymology of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX>:

               
...[<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">I</ENAMEX>]n the present instance, I am concerned
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skeat</ENAMEX> alone....  I have already had
occasion... to allude to an unfortunate habit
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skeat</ENAMEX> has of writing important notes
without <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> consulting the full and accurate Indexes
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. & Q.</ENAMEX>; and I am very sorry to be
obliged to renew my accusation.  On the former
occasion the consequences were annoying to me,
but of no great importance.  Now the matter is
much more serious, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skeat</ENAMEX> has thereby
been led to attribute to himself entirely a derivation
for the word <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> which I propounded,
both in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. & Q.</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athen√¶um</ENAMEX>,
so far back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as 1869...</NUMEX>.

            

            One could forgive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skeat</ENAMEX> for his note on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cantabrigia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8th S. ii. 329</ENAMEX>), because <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty-three</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> had then elapsed since my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> note appeared.
He had, no doubt, seen and read my
note, which was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in that number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.</ENAMEX> &
Q . and filled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> columns and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a half</TIMEX>, for he
was, even at that time, a constant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.</ENAMEX> &
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Q .</ENAMEX>, as is shown by his having contributed no
fewer than fifteen notes to the volume in which
my note is to be found; and very likely he had
carried off an impression which in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">after years</TIMEX> he
came to regard as an idea that had originated in
his own brain.  Still, as the interval between my
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> note and his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> note was so great, I do not
know that any great fault, beyond that of carelessness,
can be attributed to him.  At the same
time I thought it advisable, in my note under the
same heading ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cantabrigia</ENAMEX> ), to point out to him
that he had, no doubt inadvertently, been poaching
on my preserves, and I took advantage of the
opportunity and filled up the lacunae in the steps
of the derivation which, from want of evidence,
had been left in my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> note.  I then, naturally
enough, looked upon the incident as closed.  But
no; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skeat</ENAMEX>, just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years later</TIMEX>--again
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trusting</ENAMEX> to his memory, which seems to be particularly
faulty with regard to the contributions of
other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondents</ENAMEX>--returned to the charge,
and this time, under the heading of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> ,
wrote a longish note to the same effect as before,
and yet did not even once mention my name.
And not only did he do this, but he afterwards
‚Äúmuch expanded‚Äù this note, and this expansion
was ‚Äúprinted (with the title `<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cam'</ENAMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cambridge Review</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 Jan.</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1896.‚</NUMEX>Äù
It was not there, however, that I saw it, but in A
Student's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pastime</ENAMEX> , which has just been published
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skeat</ENAMEX>, in which the expanded note is reprinted
in full and fills <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> pages (pp. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">393-401</ENAMEX>).

            Now I defy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skeat</ENAMEX>, or any one else who
will take the trouble to read the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> notes
quoted at the beginning of this note, together
with the article in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cambridge Review</ENAMEX> , and
who will compare what I have said with what
Prof. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skeat</ENAMEX> has said--I defy either the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or the
other, I say, to find any material difference between
us.  Prof. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skeat</ENAMEX> does, indeed, in his last and
longest note (I mean the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review</ENAMEX> ) go into the question as to how it came to
pass that the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> is pronounced long
as in came --a point which I had not considered--and
he also differs from me in attributing,
without any apparent evidence, the change of the
Gr of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granta</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C of Canta</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Anglo-French</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scribes</ENAMEX> of the twelfth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>; for I was,
and am still, disposed to attribute it, in part at
least, to the undoubted confusion between the
old forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> and of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canterbury</ENAMEX> which
I have pointed out in both my notes.  But neither
of these points can be regarded as of any great
importance.

            It is, indeed, just possible that, in this second
case of forgetfulness, the substitution of Cantabrigia
as a heading, for the original <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX>,
may have had something to do with the matter;
but if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skeat</ENAMEX> had taken the trouble to consult
the Indexes as I have done, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eye</ENAMEX> would certainly,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">whilst</ENAMEX> looking for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> , have been
caught, as my own was, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cantabridga</ENAMEX> , which
stands very near to it. I think, therefore, that
this time, as the offence was repeated at the end
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> only, there is hardly any excuse to
be found for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skeat</ENAMEX>.  At all events, he seems
to me to have got into a very serious hobble; at
least I should consider it so, if I had, as is the
case with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skeat</ENAMEX>, appropriated a derivation
long before made public by another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>,
even though I had done so in the most utter
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unconsciousness</ENAMEX>.

            In conclusion, I trust that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skeat</ENAMEX> will not in
this case ignore this note and repeat the offence
at some future time.  I hope he will, for once, offer
some little explanation, and perhaps even
some words of excuse....

            [ <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Notes & Queries</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">8th S. X.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 28, '96</TIMEX>.]

         
         



            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skeat</ENAMEX>'s reply was suitably abject at the
outset, but, as might be expected, notwithstanding a
direct apology, he could not resist commenting on
the entirely irrelevant matter of the origin of wayz-goose
while attempting to turn the tables on his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> by painting himself as the put-upon, absentminded
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX>, struggling in his tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> against
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">overwhelming</ENAMEX> numbers of books and the obligations
that attend them:


I willingly admit that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chance</ENAMEX> is perfectly
correct in saying that he had explained the etymology
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> both at an earlier time and
more completely than myself.  His <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> note made
no impression on me, because I had not at that
time sufficient experience to take it in; and his
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> one I most unfortunately overlooked,
which accounts for the imperfections in my latest
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX>.

I offer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chance</ENAMEX>, for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time, my sincere
apology.  I have already printed one apology
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cambridge Review</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26 November</TIMEX> at
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 111</ENAMEX>.  I have ‚Äúgot into a serious hobble,‚Äù
doubtless; and shall be truly thankful if I can be
allowed a way out of it.

It is not at all easy for one who, like myself,
not only does a good deal of work on his own account,
but a good deal to help others, to remember
where all the multitudinous notes on words
occur.  For example, I often cannot find even my
own articles.  I certainly wrote <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on wayzgoose,
which is again inquired about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> (8th <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. X.</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">432</NUMEX>); and I have found, after some hunting, that
it appeared in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soc</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans</ENAMEX>. of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1890</TIMEX>.  The
same article says that I wrote about the word to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. & Q.</ENAMEX>; so that, by putting together the information,
I find that my note appeared in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. & Q.</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about that time</TIMEX>; but I cannot tell when till I consult
some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>.  In any case, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> in the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. & Q.</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 Nov.</TIMEX> altogether
ignores it--which does not surprise me.
I have often answered the same question twice,
and sometimes thrice; for all that, they will turn
up again.

I have a good many volumes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. & Q.</ENAMEX> in my
possession; but it often takes a long while to find
any particular number, owing to the impossibility
of keeping things in their places in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> of limited
size, when books are being sent to me from
many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all the year</TIMEX> round.  I submit that
these are extenuating circumstances; but I have
made a mistake, and must take the consequences.

            The foregoing is merely a sampling and by no
means constitutes the full documentation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skeat</ENAMEX>'s
clawing back from the brink of ignominy at having
pinched another's work.  To be sure, he was far too
good and honorable a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> to be considered, even
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">remotely</ENAMEX>, a deliberate plagiarist; but he was careless
at times and rather mean, and his apologies, always
couched in language that tried to put the onus on
others, come through as being very insincere
indeed.


         
         

            Several <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Types of Ambiguity: Minimalist Language</ENAMEX>



            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Bernstein</ENAMEX>, when he was assistant managing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York Times</ENAMEX> , published a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> organ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúWinners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinners</ENAMEX>,‚Äù that offered kudos for
the occasional ‚Äúbright passage‚Äù or deft metaphor
and cited questionable and nonstandard grammar
and usage that appeared in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>.  Among
the items that he enjoyed catching were the ambiguous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">headlines</ENAMEX>, which he dubbed ‚Äútwo-faced heads.‚Äù
These are not very hard to find in newspapers (as
of the headline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> (who is not, usually,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> of the article) is to come up with something
that is a telegraphically brief inkling of the
substance of the article.  Headline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> are often
given to paronomasia (which they would probably
call punning, as paronomasia , which would not fit
into most headlines, is not in their vocabulary).
Gleaned from the current collection:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.  Cost of food scares mounts.  [The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 90</TIMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>]

            

            I was not under the impression that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> worried
much about the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fodder</ENAMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLO</ENAMEX> may supply <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>.  [<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ibid.</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>]

            

            
               Arms is always ripe for ambiguity.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> taken on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¬•500</NUMEX> raid.  [<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ibid.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 October 90</TIMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>]

            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were not captured on the raid: the
story was about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> who had his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> (and,
as I recall, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>) wait in the family <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> while he
went off to commit a robbery.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX> filmed in secret.  [<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ibid.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 October 90</TIMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>]


            

            
               Filmed is here intended as a past participle, not the
past of an active verb.  This grammatical ambiguity
is a frequent source of confusion, one cleverly exploited
by those who write clues for crosswords.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.  Prices fear as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> shortage puts pressure on
refining.  [<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ibid.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 October 90</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">p.</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>]

            

            
               Prices is an unusual noun to find in attrubutive position
before a word like fear (in contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">noun/verb</ENAMEX>
ambiguities like drop, rise, increase, decline , etc.).  In
any event, it is still not clear why an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> shortage
should put pressure on refining (one would expect
the reverse) and why the prices resulting ought to
rise (for fear would scarcely suggest `reduction' except
in a petroleum trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> or oil company
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> report).

            That is not to say that ambiguity is confined to
headlines.  In the following quotation, the reader
may have difficulty in determining how far from his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> this ideal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> lives, why he isn't bankrupt
from feeding parking <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">meters</NUMEX>, and what circumstance
might have afflicted him with muteness:

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antiprejudice Prejudice</ENAMEX>



            Issues concerning language never seem to calm
down or go away.  Yet it would appear, from the
amount of comment published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> press,
that the subject concerns <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> more
than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.A</ENAMEX> recent report from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles</ENAMEX>
Bremner, their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX>, appeared
on the front page of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Times</ENAMEX> .  It dealt with what
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bremner</ENAMEX> characterized as the ‚Äúnew plague of euphemisms‚Äù
that threatens to overcome meaningful
communication between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>.  He was reporting
on a glossary, issued by the journalism <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>, proscribing certain
words as being offensive to special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
Interdicted are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">burly ‚Äútoo</ENAMEX> often associated with
large <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">black men‚Äù</ENAMEX> (large, yes; black, no), fried
chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúoften</ENAMEX> used to refer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX> of black
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">people‚Äù</ENAMEX> (something that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Colonel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanders</ENAMEX>
might well dispute), gyp ‚Äúbecause it insults gypsies‚Äù
(only for those who are aware of the etymological
nuances of the language), go <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> insults
‚Äúcitizens of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netherlands‚Äù</ENAMEX> (what utter balderdash
!), Ugh!  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äú</ENAMEX> `highly offensive' in any context because
it denotes the stereotype of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Indian‚</ENAMEX>Äù
(too asinine to merit comment).

            It appears that just when we were finally settling
down to remember that certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> want to
be called black (rather than colored or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Negro</ENAMEX> ), they
change their minds and now want to be called ‚ÄúAfrican
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>,‚Äù while those who are not yellow or
red or some other color are to be termed ‚Äúnon-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX>-American‚Äù
or ‚Äúnon-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  Despite
the revival of black (or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Black</ENAMEX> , I can never keep
them straight), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> are still enjoined from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">playin Ol' Black Joe</ENAMEX> and the song containing the line,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúThat</ENAMEX>'s why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darkies</ENAMEX> were born‚Äù; we should have
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">lost Ol' Man Ribber</ENAMEX> were it not for the fact that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darkies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have the name number of syllables.
Though not mentioned in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bremner</ENAMEX>'s article, it
beggars the imagination to contemplate what the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mashers</ENAMEX> want a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East Indian</ENAMEX>,
etc. to be called.  You are not allowed to say

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúspecial</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and senior citizen is beginning to appear
on the linguistic hit list.  Personally, I prefer other
terms.  When I request a discount to which I am entitled
owing to my advanced age, I ask for the fogy
discount or rate .  When in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, I request the rate
for wrinklies and delight in watching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> squirm.

            I might have mentioned that I admit to being a
little offended by a road sign on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-41</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finchley</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRIPPLES CROSSING</ENAMEX>.  I am not sure it is still
there, but I imagine there are other signs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>
equally as frank.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> have gone so far in this
business of telling it like it is that they have all but
eliminated the subjunctive that covers contrary to
fact conditions.

            All this is complete tommyrot, of course.  ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tommyrot</ENAMEX> ,
as we all know is a term of prejudice against
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>.  Better not use that word.)  It is all a
lot of crap.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Uh-oh</ENAMEX>!  I can anticipate a letter from the

Krapp enjoining me from using the word that sounds
like his name on pain of a suit for slander.)  It is nothing
but codswallop.  (Look out!  Here comes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fisherman</ENAMEX>'s
lobby!)  And I almost repeated balderdash,
which is sure to lose me the hurried hairless vote.

            Polysemy & Pleolexy



            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polysemy</ENAMEX> is the name given by linguists to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lexical</ENAMEX> phenomenon exemplified by words like run
and set , each of which has a very large of senses,
many of which seem unrelated.  (This is not the
place to enter the discussion between the dictionary
splitters `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">definers</ENAMEX> who write a definition for almost
every citation' and the combiners `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">definers</ENAMEX> who tend
to write ‚Äúbasic‚Äù definitions and rely on the ability of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to divine metaphoric extensions for themselves.')
Just to clutter up the language a bit more, I
suggest pleolexy as the term to describe the `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manywordedness</ENAMEX>'
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, the characteristic of its
enormous vocabulary that so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> comment
upon.  I thought it might be interesting to look at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of some of those words.

            As one might expect, much of the pleology of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> can be ascribed to its propensity for naming
things: many--indeed, most--of the names of organic
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inorganic chemicals</ENAMEX>, numbering in the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX>, are not listed in even the largest
general dictionaries; nor are the names of all insects
(of which, I seem to recall, there are more than
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>.  Perhaps a bit more interesting
is the intelligence that, according to The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jargon of Drugs and Drink</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard A.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spears</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scarecrow Press</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>), there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">624</NUMEX> terms
for marijuana , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">151</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.C.P.</ENAMEX> (`angel dust'), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">167</NUMEX>
for powdered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> ; in addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spears</ENAMEX> lists eight
pages' worth--too many to count--equivalents for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drunk</ENAMEX> , though added to the many metaphors and
other words and phrases are many similes ( drunk as
a badger,...as a bastard, ...as a bat , etc.).  In
contrast, the more conservative (?)  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scots Thesaurus</ENAMEX> ,
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iseabail McLeod</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aberdeen University Press</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>), lists <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 50</NUMEX> alternatives for drunk , including
smeekit, souple , and tosie , though omitting similes
and extensive metaphors (which probably abound).

            In his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúFeather Report‚Äù</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27 October 1990</TIMEX>, in
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Barnes</ENAMEX> lists the following nicknames
for the nightjar: fernowl, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fen owl</ENAMEX>, jar-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">owl</ENAMEX>,
churn-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">owl</ENAMEX>, goat-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">owl</ENAMEX>, goatsucker, nighthawk, dorhawk,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">moth</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawk</ENAMEX>, wheelbird, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puck bird</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">litch fowl</ENAMEX> ,
and gabble ratch , the last having its origins in the
Norse meaning `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpse hound</ENAMEX>,' (similar to litch <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fowl</ENAMEX> ,
which means <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">`corpse fowl</ENAMEX>').  This information he derived
from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Nightjar Yesterday and Today</ENAMEX> , by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Grainger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Williamson</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sussex Institute of Higher Education</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bishop Otter</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College</ENAMEX>), a source I have been unable to verify.

            So, the next time comment is made about all
those words that fill up (and are omitted from) the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">dictionaries</ENAMEX>, remember the nightjar and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drunk</ENAMEX> , here and abroad.

         
         
            ETYMOLOGICA OBSCURA

            
               flibbertigibbet
            

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> must be very cautious in proposing etymologies
that attribute the origin of a word to playfulness
or frivolity: they often turn out to be folk etymologies
and totally empty of anything more than
hollow speculation.  Yet, as we all know, there are
many instances of playful language, which we encounter
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>, and there is no sound reason to
reject playfulness solely on the grounds that it is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúunscholarly‚Äù</ENAMEX> to be jocular.  Any more pedantic
suggestion being absent, I take the bit between the
teeth to suggest that the above word, characterized
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> as an ‚Äúonomatopoeic representation of
unmeaning chatter,‚Äù may well be a jocular rendering
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> Flebiliter gemens , itself an almost facetious
lament meaning something like `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Woe is me</ENAMEX>!'  It
occurs in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horace</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ode ‚ÄúTo Virgil‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Book iv</ENAMEX>, Ode

            Perhaps it was formed originaly as a macaronic

many of the odes).  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later years</TIMEX> it appears in various

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Learning Disabilities</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the linguistic phenomena to have
emerged during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last hundred years or so</TIMEX> is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptance</ENAMEX> of the notion that an important step in
solving problems lies in naming them.  Although its
philosophy has been taken over by the field of psychiatry
(in which I include psychoanalysis), the idea
of shriving oneself of fears and other besetting difficulties
has its roots--as far as Western culture is
concerned--in the confessional, though it seems
likely that reflexes of that procedure could be discovered
in profound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> religions if not in shamanistic
practices.  In some ways, the fields of psychology
and psychiatry can be said to rely on the
ability of the practitioner to give a name to a condition,
whether it be normality, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">paranoia</ENAMEX> ,
or some other term.  Naming is a reverse form
of defining in that the process calls for determining a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discrete</ENAMEX> set of differentia and giving the set a unique
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title</ENAMEX>.  The next time that set of differentia is encountered,
it serves to identify the problem in much the
same way that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>, encountering a combination
of chest rash, high fever, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koplik's</ENAMEX> spots, diagnoses
(for which read `names') an affliction as measles.
Once identified, the procedure for treating measles
is well established.  The difficulty that arises with
mental and psychological afflictions is that the procedures
are not well established--indeed, might be
said to be quite chaotic, ranging from putting patients
into straitjackets to having them lie down to
‚Äúfree associate‚Äù or otherwise try to relieve themselves
of their burdens, or to administer tranquilizers
or other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that alter the chemistry of the
brain.  That is not to say that such procedures cannot
be helpful in some cases, but their results are not as
uniformly predictable as they are in many established
medical procedures.

            We are all familiar with the naming process,
whether it be with the great relief at hearing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> say ‚Äúmuscular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strain‚Äù</ENAMEX> instead of ‚Äúrheumatoid
arthritis‚Äù as he examines the x-rays, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunday</ENAMEX>
supplement newspaper article summing up (for the
umpteenth time) the latest new words and acronyms,
with nothing with amusement, admiration, or
consternation what some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> name their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>,
and with scores of other instances we encounter
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>.  In the closing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years of the 19th century</TIMEX>
there was much discussion concerning the word telegram:

               
Why do we turn so hastily to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
whenever a new word is wanted, instead of seeking
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> home-born?  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> speech is already
overburdened with outlandish words that
ought never to have been taken in, and ought
even now to be turned out.  Ere another stranger
is welcomed can we not at least see what we have
close at hand?  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spelwire</ENAMEX> and wire-spel for telegraph
and telegram have already been suggested
by the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Barnes</ENAMEX>, whose knowledge
ought to have given them some weight; it seems,
however, that they have been set aside.

Might we not, ere too late, take speechwire,
wire-speech, tellwire, wire-telth or -tale, wordwire,
wireword, for telephone and telephone message?
If none of these is thought good, there are others
to choose from.  Of the following, one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> may
be deemed as good as those already put forward.
Might we not use spelwire, wirespel for telegraph,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telegram</ENAMEX>; and sound-spelwire, sound-wirespel for
telephone and telephonic message?  The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> latter
would soon be shortened into soundwire,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">soundspel</ENAMEX>.  We already say ‚Äúwire it,‚Äù so the other
is not a very wide step beyond.  Or perhaps
flashwire, flashspel for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, and soundwire,
soundspel for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">latter</ENAMEX> might do; otherwise
tongue-wire, tongue-wire-spel (which would become
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tongue-spel</ENAMEX>) for telephone and telephonic
message.  If these will not pass, why not farwrit
or farmark for telegram, farword or farsound or
farspeech for telegraphic message, and farwriter,
farspeaker, or farteller for telegraph, telephone?
Although, indeed, against these last, notwithstanding
the laughter they might excite (of which
spark of pleasure the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> will only be too glad
to be the cause), farwrittle and farspeakle for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telegraph</ENAMEX> and telephone may have as much, if not
more, to recommend them, as they have or any
before them.

However, all are simply thrown into the field
by way of challenge, no one else having come
forward on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> side.  They will have done
good work if they only bring out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">champions</ENAMEX> that will hold the ground against them
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> too.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AD LIBRAM</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telephon</ENAMEX> is too near telephone, I fear, to be admissible;
telephone is exotic; phogram is too
abrupt, and is suggestive of program, grogram,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elijah Pogram</ENAMEX>.  I have had a polite letter from
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis J. Parker</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX>, in which
he suggests phonomit as an equivalent for a telephonic
message.  It is good, but does not fully satisfy
my aspirations.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mittophon</ENAMEX> and phonotel are
not uneuphonic.  The former I think the better
word; indeed, I fancy it to be the best yet proposed.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inventions</ENAMEX> and discoveries are named after the
fact.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bell</ENAMEX> did not sit down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> and say to himself,
‚ÄúI think I'll invent something called a telephone
today‚Äù any more than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> (or whoever) decided
to sail west from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> to discover <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.
Convention plays a major role in all aspects of language,
of course: by convention we call a certain
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fruit</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of islands west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Azores</ENAMEX> (or the equivalent in other languages);
astronomers have no difficulty in agreeing
to call a certain configuration in the heavens the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horsehead Nebula</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day of the week</TIMEX> and not
something different on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemists</ENAMEX> concur
in describing the properties of sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX>.
The world does not function uniformly, however: for
cultural reasons there are words in some languages
that are unutterable by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and we certainly
have experience with taboo words in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.

            Convention can scarcely be said to have had a
stabilizing effect in the realms of education and psychology:
both are so jargon-ridden that normal conversation
with and even among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> is often
impossible without the continual explanation of terminology
and perpetual hedging of definition.
Whatever conventions might have been agreed at
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time are found destroyed by the appearance of a
new article or book or trend.  Human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX> are accustomed
to a certain amount of imprecision in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX>:
not only does each of use give a slightly different
interpretation to the concepts represented by
words like good, justice, and God, but our speech is
peppered with expressions like I mean, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y'</ENAMEX> know , and
I don't get you .  But in the field of learning disabilities,
itself a vague, catch-all term suggestive of
many interpretations, the onomasiological problem
reached such a state of confusion <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years ago</TIMEX>--
as described in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter Two</ENAMEX> of the subject book--
that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> commissioned a
task <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">force</ENAMEX> devoted to the terminology alone.  Even a
partial list reveals the problems of distinguishing between,
say, organic brain damage and cerebral dysfunction ,
though, as is often the case in such naming,
the choice of words reflects the bias.  It is curious to
note that terms not appearing on the list included
slow learner, neurological handicap, brain injury,
and educational handicap.  In the last analysis, it
makes little difference how sterile, clinical, or innocuous
the words selected might be, for the terminology
attracts adverse connotations owing to many factors,
not the least of which is prejudice.  Most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> can remember <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> when it was flattering
to be (or have one's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">designated ‚Äúexceptional</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
I cannot crawl into the minds of the
youngest generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX> to learn
whether exceptional still carries what I must regard,
personally, to be the unconscionable semantic distortion,
both denotative and connotative, introduced
a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">generation ago</TIMEX> using ‚Äúetymological‚Äù grounds for
justification.  For the same reasons, leprosy is now
called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hansen</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> , and mongolism has become
Down syndrome ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who were once called
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crazy</ENAMEX>, mad, lunatic, demented, etc., are now categorized
as sick .  All this name changing is mere
logomancy which neither changes the fact that there
is something wrong with the afflicted nor, in the long
run, our attitudes towards them.  For some reason, if
I have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> , its virulence is somehow diminished if
I call it the big C; a myocardial infarction seems less
life-threatening than a heart attack .  Work I have
done on synonym dictionaries confirms that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
has more equivalents, at various levels of usage, for
insane than for any other concept or word in the
language.

            It is easy to be cynical on this subject and, at
times, even to try to be funny, as in referring to
DAM `<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mothers Against Dyslexia</ENAMEX>' (as does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dal Yoo</ENAMEX>, in
an article elsewhere in this issue).  But the fact is
that there is a recognizable problem or a collection
of problems, and ridiculing them is nothing more
than a defensive gesture stemming from our own discomfort
at facing them (if I may be allowed a little
armchair analysis of my own).  The defining of a concept
like `specific learning disability' is far more than
an intellectual exercise, for the applicability of laws
that relate to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with ‚Äúan imperfect ability to
listen, think, speak, read, write, spell, or to do mathematical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calculations‚Äù</ENAMEX> (as described in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Federal</ENAMEX>
law <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.L.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94-142</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 29, 1977</TIMEX>,
p65083) rely on delineating such afflictions.  Some
of us might be inclined to view terms like under-achiever
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX>'s or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">educationist</ENAMEX>'s euphemistic
jargon for dope ; but such descriptive designations,
deliberately nonspecific and presumably
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">neutral</ENAMEX> (at least for the time being), are in keeping
with the view of the human intellect taken in these
closing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years of the 20th century</TIMEX>.

            Brain dysfunction is poorly understood.  It may
be the result of injury, of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, or of congenital
defect.  The inability of an individual to master ‚Äúsimple‚Äù
language tasks that come naturally to many of
us, like reading and writing, yet to be able to perform
complex mathematical feats at lightning speed
is still more of a curiosity than predictable from a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAT</ENAMEX>-scan or other analysis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectual</ENAMEX>, psychological,
or physiological.  Little is known about the
chemistry of the brain, through its physical mapping
is proceeding apace.  In a recent letter in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nature</ENAMEX>,
‚ÄúLexical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of nouns and verbs in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brain,‚Äù Alfonso Caramazza</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Argye E. Hills</ENAMEX> reported
on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' relative ability to control specific
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">semantic</ENAMEX> categories, such as abstract vs. concrete
words, animate vs. inanimate, etc., based on the
dysfunction of a part of the brain.  And, while we
have been taught to accept that brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> are incapable
of regeneration, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> continue
to experiment with the stimulation of healthy parts
of the brain to perform functions that atrophied or
injured parts have abrogated.

            All this is heady stuff, indeed, and although
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Learning Disabilities</ENAMEX> does not treat all of them in
depth, it provides a thorough overview of its subject,
extremely useful not only as an introduction to
the field but as an important source book for those
who wish to probe further: the bibliography alone
contains close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> references.  I suppose I
must describe the book as a text, but it is well organized
and interestingly and clearly written, both attributes
lacking in so much that we see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
