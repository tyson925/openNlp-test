            It does not require much effort to read the title
question as What's the right spelling, then?
though none of the words is spelled conventionally.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English</ENAMEX> has a wealth of modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">spellings</ENAMEX> ranging
from wot and rite, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comin</ENAMEX>' and 'ad, yuh and gonna ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">snax</ENAMEX> and pleez , to thru and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xpelair</ENAMEX> .  And although
they may cause few problems for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>, they can baffle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX>.  Where do we
usually find these nonstandard forms?  What purpose
do they serve?  When are they right and when
are they wrong?  Why do we usually read them so
easily?  There are many questions to be answered,
so, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">'ow 'bout takin</ENAMEX>' a kwik look a' sum o' de main

            From the sheer numerical point of view, there
can be no doubt that literature provides us with
most examples of modified spellings, the vast majority
in fact being found in dialogues in novels.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Authors</ENAMEX>
usually want to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> an idea of not just
what a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> says, but also how he says it.  In
other words, they want to indicate how a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>'s
speech is delivered and how it may reflect social,
cultural, or geographical deviations from standard
forms.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s purpose is to give a more realistic
presentation of speech, to provide a more vivid
picture for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>.

            Alongside other features such as nonstandard
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vocabulary</ENAMEX> (regional forms, slang, etc.), nonstandard
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grammar</ENAMEX> (we was, he don't) and graphological features
(imPORtant, im-per-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">fec-tion</ENAMEX>) , modified spelling
is an essential ingredient in many novels.  The use of
such modified spelling in literature is generally referred
to as eye dialect (see definitions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Unabridged</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford Companion</ENAMEX>
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX>) .  An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> may omit letters,
perhaps to show clipped gerund forms (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">singin'</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">goin'</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whistlin</ENAMEX>') , to indicate dropped hs (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">'ello</NUMEX>, 'adn't,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'ome</ENAMEX>) , or lost final ds (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husban</ENAMEX>', <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tol</ENAMEX>') .  Extra letters are
sometimes added (hexpect, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">burg-u-lar</NUMEX>, shuttup) .  Letters
can be changed to mimic pronunciation, for example
d may replace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> (dat, dese, dem) or a may
substitute a final ow (fella, sparra, tomorra) .  Sometimes
words may be elided into forms such as kinda,
twer, wodja, gonna, tellem, owsya.  The possibilities
are more or less limitless.  Here is a fairly fertile example:


We done jest that.  I cleant dat lantun and me
and her sot de balance of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">de night</TIMEX> on top o dat
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">knoll</ENAMEX> back de graveyard.  En ef I'd knowed of

[<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Faulkner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sound and the Fury</ENAMEX>]

            

            Opportunities to modify spelling may be more
or less limitless, but they may also be rather dangerous.
If an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> tries to make a fairly accurate transcript
of, say, a regional accent by using a good deal
of eye dialect, the printed version may end up with
almost every word being altered.  At this point,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> will be faced with a barrage of unusual letter
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">combinations</ENAMEX>, a complex code that needs to be unraveled.
The consequences may be disastrous, with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> forced to concentrate more on deciphering
the words than considering their meaning, losing the
thread of events.  For many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, certain sections
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wuthering Heights</ENAMEX> have always been an irritating
puzzle:


Aw sud more likker look for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>, he replied.

[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emily BrontÃ«</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wuthering Heights</ENAMEX>]

            

            To bring some order to this possible chaos, a set
of unwritten rules has emerged for the use of modified
spelling in direct speech in novels.  The most important
rule of thumb is to avoid overburdening <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>
with anything like a close transcript of what might
actually have been said.  Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> are already
using their imagination when reading a novel, a good
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> must simply encourage them to imagine what a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>'s speech may actually sound like by providing
them with a smattering of eye-dialect markers.
In other words, just a handful of well-chosen modified
spellings indicating that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>'s speech is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonstandard</ENAMEX> should be enough to convince <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of
the mock speech reality the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> is trying to create.

            Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> therefore limit nonstandard forms
to small sections of direct speech, and only rarely
are major characters given much nonstandard dialogue.
A sprinkling of dropped hs or modified conjunctions
is often quite enough.  Indeed there are
certain common lexical items that are regularly subjected
to this treatment, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> have probably
already seen them elsewhere or quickly become accustomed
to them.  This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> includes conjunctions
(an', <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'n'</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">'cos</NUMEX>) , prepositions (o', 'bout, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">b'tween</ENAMEX>) , common
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">verb</ENAMEX> forms (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">'ave</NUMEX>, spok'n, woz, wuz) and pronouns
as shown in the table on the next page.

            Other common lexical items that are often altered
include elided verb forms (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">wanna</ENAMEX>, canna,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dunno</ENAMEX>) and question words linked to verbs (wodya,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">owja</ENAMEX>).  A pattern emerges here: the words that are
written with nonstandard spellings are generally
short words which carry little essential meaning and
which are repeated often enough for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> to become
familiar with them.  They remind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>'s way of speaking without distracting from
what is actually being said.

            When an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> wishes to indicate a geographical
or regional variety, a few key markers are again
usually quite enough.  The use of v instead of f (It's a
vine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>) is almost enough on its own to indicate a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> from southwest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>; repeated t in place
of the (It's in t' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>) suggests a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Yorkshire dialect</ENAMEX>;
the use of e instead of a indicates a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South African</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shell</ENAMEX> I give you e hend); a long drawn-out
aw rather than a shorter o suggests a southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> (He's gawn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishin</ENAMEX>' with his dawg).  Foreign
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> can quickly be identified with
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> key sounds: a v for a w suggests a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>,
a z for a th pin-points a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>.  Likewise
when <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>-based pidgins and creoles are
written down, the phonetic transcriptions use a similar
system of modified spellings to indicate pronunciation.
Examples abound in the writings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Africa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oceania</ENAMEX>, and so
on.  We come across dialogue extracts such as:


E better so.  No be for umbrella we de roast for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sun</ENAMEX> since waka come here <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dis morning</TIMEX>.

[<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chinua Achebe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Anthills of the Savannah</ENAMEX>]

            

            Most of the conventions established for representing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonstandard</ENAMEX> forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> are applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pidgins</ENAMEX> and creoles when used in literature.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Writers</ENAMEX> can also use eye dialect to indicate social
class or level of education.  A common practice
in novels is to show the speech of the lower classes
or poorly educated with dropped hs and other truncated
forms.  A further device used to indicate a lack
of education is incorrect spelling--what we could
term pointless spelling changes.  When an author
writes what as wot, no indication of pronunciation is
being given; the same is true for a number of other
words (woz, skool, gon, sez, sed, 'our, rite).  In such
cases the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> is using a phonetic spelling that reminds
us of the incorrect attempts made by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
or the uneducated at spelling these words.

            But wot as a modified spelling of what is not
restricted to novels.  It regularly crops up in graffiti,
in press advertising, in humorous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX>, in
signs.  Its wrongness immediately attracts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s
attention and, at least as far as graffiti is concerned,
it helps to set up a kind of anti-establishment bond.
The proverbial writing on the school wall is Down
with skool!  When such spellings are used in signs
and advertising for their eye-catching value, they
are usually referred to as sensational spellings.  A
classic example is the much-quoted slogan Beanz
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meanz Heinz</ENAMEX>, used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>.  Advertisements
along the roadside sometimes use sensational spelling
to an extreme degree, especially in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>.  The
following table has some typical examples:

            For similar reasons, trade names often employ
modified spellings, particularly when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more
words are put together to make a brand name.  Some
examples are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accurist, Dabitoff, Dunlopillo, Kleenex</ENAMEX>,
Kwiksave, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loctite, PlakOut</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playskool</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trufit, Westclox</ENAMEX>,
Windolene, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xpelair</ENAMEX>.

            In a few cases, a modified spelling can move into
an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">everyday</TIMEX> (standard?) area of usage.  Though is
frequently seen as tho, and through as thru in thru-
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>--the official spelling for many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>.

            High spelled as hi is frequently found in compounds
such as hijack and hi-fi.  Swop, the misspelled form
of swap has become so widely used that it is now
accepted as a standard variant by most dictionaries.
Similarly, few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>--except perhaps some pedants--nowadays
frown on certain alternative spellings,
many of which has come about through misspellings.
Some common examples are given in the
following table:

            Of course, some language <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purists</ENAMEX> object to all
forms of modified spelling outside dialogues in novels.
Leaving aside unintentional errors, spelling
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> claim that in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX>' wot is acceptable,
while almost everywhere else it is wrong.  Such
distinctions are hard to substantiate and deny the
fact that alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spellings</ENAMEX> can serve the purpose
of being eye-catching or distinctive, or even creating
a social tie.  A comparison with some other languages,
particularly languages with a largely phonetic
spelling system--(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>)--
shows that this range of nonstandard spellings is an
added bonus that our quirky <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> spelling system
has given to the language.  It is often impossible for
translators, for example, to transfer the implications
and undercurrents suggested by modified English
spellings into another language.  The multiplicity of
English spelling can therefore provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> with
a rich source of extra information that should clearly
be looked on as a positive, enriching feature of the
language.  In the right place, a wrong spelling is
often just the rite thing!

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Expressions for Sexual Harassment</ENAMEX>: a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Semantic Hole</ENAMEX>




            At least as far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> are concerned, sexual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">harassment</ENAMEX>, as well as related issues, like pornography,
have now replaced both legalized abortion
and equal opportunity as the central issues of
the sexual politics of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '90s</TIMEX>, with the obvious political
and legal ramifications.

            It may be of interest, then, to consider the language
in which this debate is normally carried out,
an examination of which, I propose, will reveal
something of the assumptions and limitations governing
virtually all discussions of the issue.

            Let me make my own ideological position explicit.
Although routinely denied, it is not always
clear whether what is being condemned is sexual harassment,
or just sex.  Or, put differently, one's
views of sexual harassment are inevitably intertwined
with one's views of âhealthy sexuality,â and,
as others have pointed out,  the current debate has
been framed by the largely puritanical segment of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s movement.

            Indeed, I would maintain that the language of
sexual harassment reflects this ideological bias.  To
start, consider the expression to make sexual advances .
Clearly the term has a formal (and legalistic)
connotation which is hardly neutral.  Although
someone might reasonably characterize one's own
behavior as âflirting,â for example, it is unlikely that
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> would report âmaking sexual advances,â
except facetiously.  The term usually appears expanded
in one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways: univited sexual advances
and unwanted or unwelcome sexual advances .  The
distinction is significant.  What is an âinvited sexual
advance?â    If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A</ENAMEX> invites B to make a sexual advance,
then A has made an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">âuninvited sexual advanceâ</ENAMEX>: any
initial step is `uninvited' by definition.  To construe
uninvited sexual advances as a form of sexual harassment
is to condemn all sexual advances.

            
               Unwanted sexual advances are rather different.
Whereas uninvited sexual advances can be identified
by both parties before they occur, unwanted sexual
advances are presumably identifiable by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> party
only after they occur, i.e., when they have been rejected.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> receiving the sexual advance may
know in advance that it is not wanted, but not the
party making the sexual advance.  Indeed, it seems
likely that the behavior in question is more likely to
be characterized as a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">âsexual advanceâ</ENAMEX> if it is rejected.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> does not usually respond favorably to a
sexual advance.  Furthermore, invitations that are
clearly nonsexual are rarely referred to as advances
at all.  To make advances means to make sexual advances .
The word advances is itself emotionally
charged.

            But, to repeat, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> engaged in the behavior
referred to rarely use such terms at all.  So
what terms do they use?

            Well, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> or to woo someone sounds absolutely
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victorian</ENAMEX>, whereas to seduce someone sounds
morally reprehensible.  Expressions like to come on
to someone or to hit on someone, or to make a pass ,
being largely informal, seem to have a frivolous, or
sometimes even a threatening connotation.  Young
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will sometimes talk of working (on) someone,
which sounds exploitative.  Even flirting implies a
cavalier attitude which may be innocuous, but which
also may connote a lack of sincerity.

            I have been intentionally vague regarding the
grammatical subject and object of these verbs.  First,
it is clear that heterosexuality is assumed, unless
there is some evidence to the contrary.  Furthermore,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> do not normally court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, and although
both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> may flirt or seduce , a sentence
like My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> hit on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> out of context will
typically be understood to refer to a male neighbor
and a female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, and not vice-versa.

            There is a whole range of behaviors which are
sexually ambiguous to a certain extent, almost by
definition, a fact which is reflected in expressions
like to ask for a date or to express an interest in someone,
where the sexual interest is tacit, but not explict.
Similarly, expressions like to (try to) connect
with or to (try to) get next to someone may or may
not express sexual intent

            So, unless I have missed a range of expressions,
the conclusion one can draw from the above is that
the language we use to describe the initial attempts
to establish sexual relations is either puritanical, or
hostile, or frivolous, or ambiguous, hardly the range
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> would expect in an open, sexually healthy, egalitarian
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">âsemantic holeâ</ENAMEX> is itself a symptom
of the disease. 
            
            See, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Camille Paglia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">âThe Joy of Presbyterian Sex</ENAMEX>,â
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Republic</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2, 1991</TIMEX>, pps. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24-27</NUMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susie</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bright, âThe Prime of Miss Catherine MacKinnon,â In These</ENAMEX>
Times , pp. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39-40</NUMEX>.  I feel obligated to add that, as someone accused
of sexual harassment, my interest in these issues is not
purely academic.
            I take the approaches made by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitutes</ENAMEX> to be classic examples of
uninvited sexual advances .  Whatever one's views of prostitution,
however, one would be hard pressed to seriously consider such
behavior as a form of sexual harassment.  Incidentally, a related
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linguistic</ENAMEX> usage, and one which I agree is pernicious, is illustrated
by the allegation that certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> invite offensive behavior--
even violence--through, for example, their dress or appearance.
The contradiction is clear.  If neither dress nor appearance constitutes
an invitation to make sexual advances, then it is difficult to see
how the fact that sexual advances are uninvited should be sufficient
basis for allegations of sexual harassment.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> obvious example of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">âsemantic holeâ</ENAMEX> in sexual relationships
is the often-observed absence of neutral terms for unmarried sexual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> writes that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> is seriously
considering the expression spousal equivalent .  The caricature has
now become the reality.
         
         
            Language at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay</ENAMEX>




            Much of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode Island</ENAMEX> fronts on Narragansett
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay</ENAMEX>, hence is called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocean State</ENAMEX>.  Moreover,
her language reflects this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> in subtle
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX>.  Take, for instance, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Islander</ENAMEX> who
pointed to a sparrow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawk</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">birders</ENAMEX> prefer to call it
a kestrel) and, perhaps being mindful the early <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>'s
questionable custom of profitable privateering,
called it a privateer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawk</ENAMEX> .  Would that be understood
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nebraska</ENAMEX>?  Maybe not, but any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode</ENAMEX>
Islander aware of his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s predacious history
would get the idea.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Block Island</ENAMEX>, awash in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode Island</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sound</ENAMEX>,
shares with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX> the term for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">double-</TIMEX>ended vessels
large or small.  The wooden, lap-straked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> go by
the name of peapods .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Graphic</ENAMEX> to say the least, since
their hulls were not only so shaped but were often
painted green.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Block Islanders</ENAMEX>, furthermore, have
tossed their share of nautical expressions into the
stream of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode Island</ENAMEX> consciousness, as when
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Allen</ENAMEX>, ancient seafarer, reported on his visit
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>.  Was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX> given a clean bill of
health?  <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â Clean</ENAMEX> as a quill,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â</ENAMEX> came the reply.  Again,
when asked how his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, who had been bound over
to a nursing home, was faring, he lamented, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">âShe</ENAMEX>'s
been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">draggin</ENAMEX>' a fin.â
            

            Narragansett <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> might not have invented the
term shift wedding , but they practiced the custom.
When a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX>, bereft of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, and deep in
his debts, sought to marry anew, she must first slough
off his obligations.  To do this, she had first to appear
at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> of the peace clad scantily
in nothing but a shift (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a negligee</NUMEX>).  Next, if she
lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington County</ENAMEX>, she must proceed to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shift Corner</ENAMEX> , site of shift weddings, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
towns come together, and there step through all
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> to satisfy their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> that she
owned nothing but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shirt</ENAMEX> on her back.  Then and
only then was her new wooer free to marry this second-hand
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife sans</ENAMEX> debts.  Very convenient for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX> who had lost her first love at sea.

            Everyone knows black <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX>, the pestilence of
May taking away the pleasures of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">merry month</TIMEX>,
because, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> said with merry understatement,
when <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">black flies bite</ENAMEX>, they do attract your attention.
But probably only in seagirt states do the
insects go by the name buckeye <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX>.  The explanation?
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anadromous herring</ENAMEX> return each spring
and course up the streams to spawn, streams such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buckeye Brook</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlestown</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herring</ENAMEX>?  Yes, but
locally called buckeyes , and their return coincides
with the appearance of the unwelcome flies.  But if
you pronounced buckeye as they do in the Buckeye
State, referring to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, you would be wrong: in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode Island</ENAMEX> this would be pronounced, as it was in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of yore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">âBUCKee</ENAMEX>.â
Chaucer, after all, probably pronounced eye <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">âeeâ</ENAMEX> to
rhyme with sea , as in âthe smalle foules... slepen
all the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> with open ee.â  That pronunciation has
persisted here.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pilots</ENAMEX> of the ferries on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Narragansett Bay</ENAMEX>, like all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mariners</ENAMEX>, had ideal opportunities to observe meteorological
events such as sea turns and waterspouts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Captain Arthur Knowles</ENAMEX> and his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman</ENAMEX> used a neat expression for the sky when a
cool northwesterly breeze swept over the bay clearing
out every vestige of cloud except those low to
the southeast, where the warm water of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf</ENAMEX>
Stream condensed as a ragged range of billowy
clouds.  These the ferrymen called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lee</ENAMEX> set .

            The euphonious word skilligalee came ashore in
Narragansett bay as an alternative name for the marlin.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s New International , however, defines
skilligalee as a âworthless coin,â while the form skillagalee
is defined as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">âthin broth</ENAMEX>.â  Any connection
here?

            Picture small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> on the bay, each manned by
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> fisherman tonging for quahogs (pronounced
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">âKOEhogsâ</ENAMEX>).  The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tongs</ENAMEX> consist of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> long poles
with rakes affixed and crossed at the nether end,
rakes many-toothed, curved and facing each other so
as to clench the catch of hard-shelled clams.  The
fishermen toil at this job, working the poles in and
out, in and out, endlessly.  It is muscle-building toil,
this opening and closing of the poles, and it has
earned for the tongs the name <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Greenwich</ENAMEX> accordions .
The only music they produce is the whistle of
the tongers on the way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>.

            To me the choicest of these maritime terms I
have heard only once, but I was not a little pleased
to hear it.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emory Bennett</ENAMEX> had been to a political
convention at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warwick</ENAMEX>.  He described the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Governor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> Farm where it took place, an idyllic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> on
land gradually sloping to the bay and margined with
what most of us would call a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt marsh</ENAMEX>.  He called it
a sea pasture , a term absent as such from the dictionaries.
It brought to minds a phrase from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milton</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">âseaweed their pastureâ</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Paradise Lost , vii</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">404</NUMEX>),
except that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Emory</ENAMEX> meant the wide expanse of tidal
grass just up from the beach and inundated twice
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>.  This grass, incidentally, was called thatch
locally, suggesting an early colonial use for it.  Furthermore,
it enhanced the term to hear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emory</ENAMEX> pronounce
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pasture âPASTOR</ENAMEX>.â

            Let it not be said, then, that the smallest state
has not contributed to the richness of the mother
tongue.

            On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beyond Zebra</ENAMEX>, or, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No-Longer-Roman Alphabet</ENAMEX>




            We speak of our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-six</TIMEX> letter alphabet as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">âRomanâ alphabet</ENAMEX>, even though the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> generally used nineteen of these letters.
The letters I, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> were created much later,
while the letters <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>, Z were used primarily in
transcribing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> words.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alphabet</ENAMEX> is used for writing most of the world's
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX>-odd languages, and it is no longer really <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman</ENAMEX>
any more.  Take <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hawaiian</ENAMEX>, for instance:


A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">a   O o    K ke   N  nu</ENAMEX>
E e   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U u    L la   P</ENAMEX>  pi
I i   H he   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> mu   W  we
                    '  okina

            

            Not only are such important letters as B, C, D, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>,
and T missing, even the order of the letters has been
changed!  And what is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">apostrophe</ENAMEX> doing at the
end?  (It symbolizes a glottal stop.)

            Other languages pepper their letters with diacritics.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> alphabet, even though it
omits the letters q, w, x, and y, still boasts a whopping
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thirty</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>: A, A, B, C, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX>, D, E, Ã, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>,
G, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GY</ENAMEX>, H, I, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K, L</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LY</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O, Ã</ENAMEX>, Ã, \?\, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SZ</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TY</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>, Ã, Ã, \?\, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZS</ENAMEX>.  Pity the poor typographer
who has to keep the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">o</ENAMEX> and u straight!
The phenomenon of digraphs (letter pairs) functioning
as single letters is not uncommon; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> dictionaries
routinely list <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ch, Ll</ENAMEX>, and sometimes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rr</ENAMEX> as separate
letters.  Even <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> address books sometimes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">treat Mc</ENAMEX> as a separate letter, although that is a specialized
instance.

            Some of the weirdest additions to the no-longer-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX>
alphabet are in languages that were first
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcribed</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the twentieth century</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhuang</ENAMEX>, a Tai
language spoken in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern China</ENAMEX>, defies typographers
by employing letters resembling the numbers
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> to indicate syllabic tone: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">\symbol</ENAMEX>\.
Several languages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Africa</ENAMEX> employ familiar
non-alphabetic symbols, like ! and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#</NUMEX> to indicate
the unusual click sounds.  Also in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> we find the
curly-tailed \?\ and \?\ to indicate ingressive sounds.

            Surprisingly, even the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language requires
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than twenty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> letters to write.  A
glance at the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oxford English Dictionary reveals</ENAMEX>
many archaic words written with the letters Ã¦ (ash),
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ã°</ENAMEX> (eth), \?\ Ã¾(thorn), \?\ (wynn), and \?\ (yogh).  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ash</ENAMEX> is a
ligature of A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX>; there are many other ligatures,
like fi and fl, that are not considered letters in their
own right.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eth</ENAMEX> and yogh are graphic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> of d
and g respectively.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thorn</ENAMEX> and wynn are borrowings
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runic</ENAMEX> alphabet, once widely used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scandinavia</ENAMEX>.

            In general, new additions to the alphabet fall
into the following categories: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>. letters with diacritics
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">(Ã¤, Ã©</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. modified letters (\?\, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">\?\</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ligatures (Å</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ã¦, Î², &</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digraphs</ENAMEX> (ch, sz), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. numbers and modified
numbers, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">punctuation</ENAMEX> marks and other non-alphabetic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> (!, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#</NUMEX>, '), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. letters from non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alphabets (Ã¾</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">\?\</ENAMEX>).  It is surprisingly hard to
think up any letters that do not come from these
easily identified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible exception is
the new name adopted by the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> formerly
known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX>.  He has changed his name to
\?\, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of unspecified phonetic value, that (if
I may be permitted to hazard a conjecture about this
decidedly nonlinguistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>) seems to be a cross
between the female sign \?\, the male sign \?\, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian</ENAMEX> ankh sign \?\.  Thanks to the magic of wordprocessors
and do-it-yourself fonts, the typographers
of many popular magazines have gamely incorporated
this new word into their repertoire,
sometimes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">possessive form â</ENAMEX>\?\'s.â
         
         
            Mountain Talk




            Since its inception in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 19th century</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mountaineering</ENAMEX> and climbing have evolved
their own special language.  A `way up a mountain or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cliff</ENAMEX>' is known as a route .  Certain routes which are
not necessarily the highest, longest or highest ones
in the area are known as classics .

            A pitch is `one rope's length of a route,' while
the most difficult part is called the crux .  There is
always a belay or anchor point at the ends of each
pitch.  Utilizing one of these or using the rope to
safeguard another climber is belaying .  A psychological
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">belay</ENAMEX> is one that would not support a falling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">climber</ENAMEX>.  Loops of rope or tape, called slings , fitted
with karabiners or krabs `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal snaplinks</ENAMEX>,' are used
for running belays or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX> .  These are placed on
the rock face during the ascent and used to prevent
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> from falling too far.  Slings can be slipped
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX> points of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX>, attached to pitons `metal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spikes</ENAMEX>'
or chocked `fitted into cracks with shaped pieces of
metal.'  These <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> are called chocks (small pebbles
were originally used for this purpose) or nuts
(the earliest metal chocks being nuts with the screwthreads
drilled out).  A `small chock on a thin wire
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sling'</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> on a wire .  Pitons have various names,
such as pegs, spikes, leepers, rurps, or bong-bongs .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> carries this equipment on a set of krabs
known as a rack .

            Different ropes have names.  The `climbing
rope' is the active or live rope .  Coming from the rear
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">climber</ENAMEX>'s harness it is a back rope ; fixed at chest
level to give the climber a rest it is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX>'s tail .

            Faults in the face provide the means for climbing
it.  The easiest and safest method of ascending is
to chimney up a chimney , a wide crack that is
climbed in the fashion of a chimney sweep.  Alternative
names for this maneuver are bridging or foot
and backing .  Piles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> ( cairns or stonemen ) are
built on peaks and along cols (a saddle or pass ).  A
`sharp rock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ridge</ENAMEX>' is an arete , sometimes only passable
by going a chaval [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Ã  cheval</ENAMEX> ], that is, `sitting
astride the top as on a horse.'  A crack with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> protruding
edge can be laybacked `climbed by pushing
with the feet while pulling with the hands.'  A prominent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ledge</ENAMEX> is a mantelshelf which is mantelshelfd
`climbed as if going onto a fireplace mantelshelf.'

            Routes are graded in terms of height, difficulty,
and exposure, the vertical distance below the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">climber</ENAMEX>.  The grades are easy, moderate, difficult, very
difficult or v. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diff</ENAMEX>, severe, very severe or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VS</ENAMEX>, hard very
severe or HVS, extremely severe or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX>, and exceptionally
severe or XS.  Holds range from friction through
thin to jug handles .  A large hold at the end of a hard
pitch is often called a thank-God hold .  A very small
hold that depends on the friction between the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">climber</ENAMEX>'s boot and the rock is a smear .  When the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">climber</ENAMEX> uses the inside edge of his boot on a very
narrow hold, he is edging .

            Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> climbers have developed a system
of calls.  Tight rope means `take in any slack
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rope</ENAMEX>,' while slake [`slack'] means `let out a little
more rope.'  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> shouts âTaking inâ when he
reaches the top of a pitch and begins gathering in
the slack.  When the rope goes taut, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> answers
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">âThat</ENAMEX>'s meâ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> will then belay and
instruct the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> âClimb when you're readyâ; the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">âClimbing</ENAMEX>,â and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> acknowledges,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">âAye</ENAMEX>, aye.â

            Someone who is `taking risks' is feeling brave ,
and when he falls, he is peeling .  Any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">climber</ENAMEX> who
comes to a stop through `lack of energy' is bonked
out .  If this is caused by a `lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>,' he is suffering
from hunger knock .  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">climber</ENAMEX> who is feeling nervous
is being gripped .

            Helmets which are now worn by almost every
climber are dubbed bone-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX> .
         
         

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Davis</ENAMEX>'s letter in VERBATIM [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XX,4</NUMEX>] was very
interesting and dealt with a sad and serious situation
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language, viz., tautological
modes of expression.  But I do not agree
with the statement in his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> paragraph that one
cannot enclosed an item anywhere but âherewith.â
His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">solicitor</ENAMEX> could well have stated, âWe have pleasure
in enclosing--with a statement that we are mailing
separately.â  A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> may also be enclosed in a
barbed-wire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fence</ENAMEX> and not in any way âherewith.â

            I also take exception to considering âThey gave
us a number of donationsâ as tautological.  The
phrase a number of is one of several that are commonly
used, at least in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX>, with reference
to indefinite numbers, each of which has a
slightly different significance: a few, several, a great
many, numerous , etc.




         
         
            [There is no dispute about the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> point.  With
regard to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, it must be noted that without
specifying where an item is enclosed, it would usually
be construed as accompanying the message,
hence I should agree that enclosed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">herewith</ENAMEX> is redundant.
As for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fence enclosures</ENAMEX>, that is another
sense of enclose .-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX> ]
         
         

            Regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Davis</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPISTOLA</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XX,4</NUMEX>] and
his list of tautologies, I believe that enclosed herewith
is but a borderline example if one at all.  My
understanding is that when a check, for example, is
placed within the fold of its cover letter, it is properly
referred to as being enclosed --or enclosed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">herein</ENAMEX> .  If an enclosure is not within the letter but
separate from it in the same envelope, it is enclosed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">herewith</ENAMEX> .

            Anyone with half an eye will be able to find as
enclosure, whether it is in or with the covering letter;
but it is my belief that, while adequate English
can be readily understood, good English precludes,
if possible, any misunderstanding.




         
         
            [We would not dare to disagree, but the distinction
between enclosed [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">herein</ENAMEX>] and enclosed herewith
seems a finicky needle's-eye of pedantry, and it
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">smacks of âreconstructionâ</ENAMEX> of something that was
never structured to begin with.  Besides, the great
difficulty encountered in finding checks occurs when
they were not enclosed to begin with (or arrive unsigned).--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX>]
         
         

            As usual, the latest issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> is stimulating
to the point of making one laugh or grunt
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aloud</ENAMEX>, alarming fellow<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-passengers</ENAMEX> on the Sheringham
train.

            I think you are unfair to mock <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carver</ENAMEX> about his
derivation of raccoon .  A raccoon scrabbling on the
bottom of a stream is not, as you put it, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">âunnatural</ENAMEX>.â
Away from the suburbs, shallow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is its natural
feeding place, and âcrabs and other tidbitsâ (why do
we call them âtitbitsâ over here?), which it finds by
touch, are its natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>.  The scientific name for
the raccoon, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procyon</ENAMEX> lotor the `doglike washer,' describes
this behavior.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algonquins</ENAMEX> had it right.

            I write about natural history for a living.  One
book in particular resides on my desk as a regular
source of inspiration: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund C. Jaeger</ENAMEX>'s Source
Book of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Biological Names and Terms</ENAMEX> , first published
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles C. Thomas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Springfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>.
I have the revised <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> edition, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX>.  Many animals
were--and are--wonderfully well-named by taxonomists,
following in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linnaeus</ENAMEX>' footsteps: this book is
the key to their wisdom, and often their humor.  It
brings scientific names to life.

            Consider those who would give the gentle and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">intelligent killer whale</ENAMEX> a less pejorative name.  They
went to its binomial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orcinus</ENAMEX> orca (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Linnaeus 1758</ENAMEX>) to
find a softer synonym and chose âOrca.<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â</ENAMEX>  Had they
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">consulted Jaeger</ENAMEX>, they would have found that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orcinus</ENAMEX> is the adjectival form of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orcus</ENAMEX> ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
name for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hades</ENAMEX>.  Although orca can mean a `dice
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">box</ENAMEX>' (or a `little barrel'), it also means a `kind of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">whale</ENAMEX>, the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killer</ENAMEX>,' perhaps derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orcus</ENAMEX> .
Surely it was in this sense that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linnaeus</ENAMEX> used it.
Orca functions as a euphemism only because its true
meaning is forgotten.  More suitable would have
been the name used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tlingit</ENAMEX> of northwest
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX>, who hold the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> in high esteem.  They
call it keet : not very euphonious, but friendly.




         
         

            I was interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Verrall</ENAMEX>'s letter [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XX,4</NUMEX>]
regarding hagas for haws , `berry/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> of the hawthorn.'
If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verrall</ENAMEX> had crossed over the Sussex
border into <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kent</ENAMEX>, he might still hear a curious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variant</ENAMEX>.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weald</ENAMEX>, haazes , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> dropped, is still
used for haws .  Occasionally, the close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listener</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX>
may also hear the pre-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1939</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> call
them harves .  I am <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty-five</TIMEX>, but when I was a boy
living in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Downland</ENAMEX> area south of Sittingbourne
up to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maidstone</ENAMEX>, it was common to hear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> calling haws arzey-garzeys , sometimes varied
to azzy-gazzies .  I haven't heard this for many
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and I fear when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> has âcrossed
overâ this description, like my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>, will be
defunct.




         
         

            The report below includes subscriptions in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX> only.

            In commenting on the report of the banning of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XX,4,20</NUMEX>], you are reminded of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher groups</ENAMEX> âwho... campaigned
to ban the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of American Slang ...â Surely</ENAMEX>
this is an injustice.  All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> here,
most notably the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Federation of Teachers</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Teachers Association</ENAMEX>, campaigned strenuously
and successfully against the proposed ban,
which was sought by assorted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prurient-</ENAMEX>minded prudes
and obscurantist political zealots only.  (Although for
the most part ignoramuses, these did know where to
look for the naughty words.)  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teachers</ENAMEX> have been
made scapegoats for many social ills; it would be a
service to acknowledge their occasional courage and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">virtue</ENAMEX> in opposing the flatheads of the world, rather
than lumping them in with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fools</ENAMEX>.




         
         

            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual men</ENAMEX> may indeed use terms
like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">divine</ENAMEX>, adorable , or mauve [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XX</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4,7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BIBLIOGRAPHIA</ENAMEX>],
but that surely does not include all homosexual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.  I, for one, can barely tell you which of
the colors I dislike is mauve and which is fuchsia.  I
don't like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garland</ENAMEX> or disco either.  And never mind
that it's taken me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost 50 years</TIMEX> to learn how to
put a reasonable outfit together: I may be in danger
of losing my gay accreditation.

            My point, however, is serious.  Sexual orientation
does not confer taste, the lack of it, or a set of
socially approved (or disapproved) styles or--more
important--values.  Your closing comment on the
research suggesting homosexuality is gene-related
seems well off the mark in this regard.

            The entire drift of your article on sexism in language
is that much sexual behavior is shaped by
nature.  Since the sexual orientation heterosexual is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetic</ENAMEX>, it stands to reason that the eternally recurring
variant sexual orientation homosexual likewise
has a genetic base.

            Acknowledging that, however, frees no one
from accepting responsibility for her or his behavior.
Nor does the hypothesized genetic link explain
the awesome variations within the different sexual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orientations</ENAMEX>.  Chromosomes do not exculpate the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">predators Ted Bundy</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Wayne Gacy</ENAMEX>, and they
certainly cannot reductively account for the prose of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway or Proust</ENAMEX>.




         
         
            [My point about mauve was that it has no particular
usage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> but that devine and adorable ,
among other words, are âassociated with ways in
which some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> but probably no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> (except
those imitating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> sarcastically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX>, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decorators</ENAMEX>) express themselves.â  I certainly
did not say or suggest that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX> or, indeed,
all of any group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> use any particular
word with any consistency.  Being either homosexual
or heterosexual, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> or female, or fitting into
any one of the myriad gradations between those extremes
has nothing whatsoever to do with taste or
values, and I did not imply that it does.

            My closing comment referred to current research
that attempts to show that homosexuality is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-related, which I termed âfatalisticâ because it
would appear to relieve any individual of responsibility
for his actions: as we learn from frequent press
reports, defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> are seeking exoneration
for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> on the grounds that although they
committed the crime in question, it was circumstances--abuse
when they were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> is quite
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">popular</ENAMEX>--that were responsible for their actions,
and they should be let off.

            I did not write anywhere that âmuch sexual behavior
is shaped by nature.â  I wrote: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">âone</ENAMEX> must be
careful to distinguish between nature, in which we
must recognize that there are differences between
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>, and bias, which ought not be tolerated.â
I keep an open mind on the question of the
genetic origins of heterosexuality and homosexuality.
I regard efforts to stereotype or categorize people
as futile as they are tedious.--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX>]
         
         

            Re your recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OBITER DICTA</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXI,1</NUMEX>], I'm sorry
you did not delve further into the idea that the word
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">black</ENAMEX> is on its way out.  I hope not, though I have
seen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of color , a far better descriptive term,
being used more frequently.  I do, however, pray
fervently that the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> would
vanish completely.  It is cumbersome and greatly
misleading, and it sounds sycophantic.  Whenever I
hear a white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> use that term I feel he is
proudly intimating an obvious lack of prejudice.  I
draw an analogy between that and the time I heard
my <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">landlady</ENAMEX> announce that she was going to
a wedding between her niece and a âvery nice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boy,â</ENAMEX> suggesting strongly that âthis Germanâ
harbored no prejudice towards <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>.

            Whenever I see the term <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> ,
with its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX> letters, in print twelve times in a
single article, I wonder if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> realizes how
much space is wasting and how pedantic it all
sounds.

            Let me put a few cases, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> said to
Pip, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Expectations</ENAMEX>: Suppose the following
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> came to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>:


a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moroccan Jew</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Casablanca</ENAMEX>
a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rhodesian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX>
a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Boer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> from just outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Johannesburg</ENAMEX>
an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>

            

            Are they all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX>?  The word is a hyphenated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misnomer</ENAMEX>.




         
         
            [The problem lies in the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> lack a sense
of history.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX> , used by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, refers to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Negroes</ENAMEX>;
but (colonial) <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Britons</ENAMEX> have used it to refer to
any dark-skinned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, particularly southeast
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asians</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> of color is an old facetious euphemism
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Negroes</ENAMEX>: it is the plural of gentleman of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colored</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> , etc.) all
seemed quite satisfactory and have been used by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Negroes</ENAMEX> to refer to themselves.  The picture is further
confused by the term <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coloured</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South African</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> for a `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> of racially mixed parentage.'
(But then, there was the old vaudeville
(minstrel?) tune, My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gal</ENAMEX>'s a high-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> / She's
black but not too shady /.../ She ain't colored--she
was born that way ... which would invoke great
wrath <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.)  The problem with colored is that,
taken literally, it can be used to refer to anyone who
is not white.  There is--or was--a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> newspaper
called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Afro-American</ENAMEX> , and there is a popular
magazine called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ebony</ENAMEX> .  As Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Livingston</ENAMEX> points
out, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> is--or can be--ambiguous
and is a poor choice solely on that ground.  The
press in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> is virtually enjoined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> from
identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> by race in the text of articles, a
practice that has extended to the banning of songs
and spirituals like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ol' Black Joe</ENAMEX> .  But that is got
round either by showing a photograph or by making
certain that we learn the subject's name is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wong Fu</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Takashimaya</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Rourke</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nielsen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rashid</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zbigniew</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Molotov</ENAMEX> , etc., though one is less
likely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> to be able to identify race, color, or
ethnicity from certain names (like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Livingston</ENAMEX>, for example).
These are linguistic clues, and can be misleading:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cf. Whoopi Goldberg</ENAMEX> .  The problem lies not
in the name but in the prejudices of bigots and in
the perception of those who are discriminated
against.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Undeniably</ENAMEX>, there is prejudice against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Negroes</ENAMEX>
in many Western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX>, and, as long as that
prejudice exists, it will attach to the name of those
against whom the prejudice is felt or practiced.
Thus, we can be confident that as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> passes, the
term <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> will be exchanged for something
else: perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Negro</ENAMEX> will again become the politically
correct term.  Other words, like darky , are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">taboo</ENAMEX>, leading to a change in the lyrics of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kern</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ol' Man Ribber</ENAMEX> (now probably <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">âOld Man</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riverâ</ENAMEX>).

            Racial and religious slurs and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">epithets</ENAMEX> abound;
sometimes those who use them are not even aware
that they are offensive (like the term <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jew</ENAMEX>).  Older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> labeled the term <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jewess</ENAMEX> as
offensive, but I have heard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> refer to
themselves using the word, evidently oblivious to
what lexicographers identified as insulting.

            I quite agree that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> is both cumbersome
and undescriptive; I am also aware that
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> do not use the term: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Jackson</ENAMEX> uses
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">black</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAACP</ENAMEX> has retained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colored People</ENAMEX> in
its name.  Not the smallest part of the problem arises
between those who seek the general acceptance of
anonymity in which any identifying reference is eschewed
and those who stridently voice their ethnicity
and race.-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX> ]

            Of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surf</ENAMEX> and Such



            There are several customary formulae applied
to words whose histories remain unclear.  âOf unknown
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">originâ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">âorigin uncertainâ</ENAMEX> are blank
walls beyond which few can go.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">âPerhapsâ</ENAMEX> indicates
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lexicographer</ENAMEX>'s wish to be helpful or to solve a
problem or not to be beaten; âprobablyâ a slightly
firmer resolve or, more dangerously, tidiness of
mind.  But the fact remains that some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of
words that have entries in a standard dictionary remain
etymological mysteries.  And some of these are
our everyday <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companions</ENAMEX>, whose credentials we do
not doubt and whose very ordinariness leads us to
take them for granted.

            Take surf , the `swell of the sea which breaks on
the shore and slides back' with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arnold</ENAMEX>'s âslow, forgiving
roar.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â  Surf</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1685</TIMEX>, on the coast
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and, bearing a strong resemblance to suff ,
found <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100 years earlier</TIMEX> on the same coast and with
much the same meaning, may be presumed to be a
variant form of the same word; it may also be assumed
to be of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> origin.  In fact, as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late as 1840</TIMEX>,
crossing the surf can be described as âan expression
equivalent to `entering or leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>,' as a person
is never supposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">venture</ENAMEX> across this tremendous
barrier of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Coromandel coast</ENAMEX>, unless on such momentous
occasions.â  But, from the middle of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th century</TIMEX>, this sense had been supplemented by
a more generalized but at the same time more precise
sense of the `mass or line of white foamy water
caused by the sea breaking upon a shore or a rock.'
Surf in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian English</ENAMEX>, of course, has this general
meaning but is used mostly of the sea, and particularly
the surf, as a place of recreation.  It is earliest
recorded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1908</TIMEX>, in a couplet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arnold</ENAMEX> would have
been proud to claim:


The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manly</ENAMEX> maidens shoot the surf,
Or bake their bingies on the shingly shore.

            

            In this sense, and with a host of compounds amplifying
and asserting the recreational possibilities,
we tend to think of it as our own and as an important
part of our social history.  But it is as much a part of
international <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as it is of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX>, as the
provenance of the range of compounds suggests.  So,
to take only a selection of the more common terms,
surfbathing dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1884</TIMEX>, surfboard from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1826</TIMEX>,
surfboat from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1856</TIMEX>, surfriding from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1882</TIMEX>, and surf-swimmer
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1845</TIMEX>, all long before the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian</ENAMEX>
enjoyment of the surf is recorded in the early
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years of this century</TIMEX>.  What is our own and what
light do the terms collectively throw on our society?
First, surf as a verb [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1913</TIMEX>] seems to be an abbreviation
of the now obsolete surf-bathe [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1906</TIMEX>].  And
surf-bathing was not always respectable.  As a writer
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sydney Truth</ENAMEX> observed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>, âI think respectable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> may go surf-bathing and still remain
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">respectable</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who aren't moral and
respectable do not become so by shooting the breakers
and airing their figures on the beach.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â  Or</ENAMEX>, in the
terms of a dialogue reported in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â</ENAMEX> `Oh, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Auntie</ENAMEX>,' said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, `what's surf-bathing?'
`Something the savages do on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX>,' replied the
aunt vaguely.â  The difficulty lay in the garments
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">worn</ENAMEX> and the degree of exposure they allowed.  As a
local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> ordinance put it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1902</TIMEX>:


All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> bathing in any waters exposed to view
from any wharf, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, public place, or dwelling-house
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Municipal District of Manly</ENAMEX>, before the
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour of 7.30 in the morning</TIMEX> and after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the hour of</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 o'clock in the evening</TIMEX>, shall be attired in proper
bathing costume covering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> from neck to the

shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding one
pound.

            

            The existence of surf beaches within the environs of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX>--at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bondi, Bronte, Coogee</ENAMEX>, and Tamarama
in the south and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manly</ENAMEX> to the north--meant that the
battle of the beaches was fought in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX>, and,
when respectability was obtained, that it was in the
terms of an activity very much associated with
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX>, surf-life-saving.  Surf <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> , glossed as `lifesaving
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">club</ENAMEX>,' is <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1913</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Surf</ENAMEX> and LifeSaving
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1915</TIMEX>.  The surf carnival [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1914</TIMEX>] was
initially as much a public-relations exercise as a competitive
occasion, the iron <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>??] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unheard-of</ENAMEX>.

for instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coogee</ENAMEX> was surf-bather [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1906</TIMEX>].  This
was soon joined, and ultimately replaced by surfer
[<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1913</TIMEX>], and the earliest quotation for surfer , being
part of an account of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">âa surfer</ENAMEX>'s companion,<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â a</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dainty</ENAMEX> article intended to hold bathing suit and wet

a potential market amongst the fraternity (a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1919</TIMEX> saying emphatically that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">âSurf-Bathing</ENAMEX> is dangerous
for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">womenâ</NUMEX>).  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">surfer</ENAMEX>'s companion , incidentally,
was irrefutably <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX>, being made of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dingo</ENAMEX> skin!  The contemporary surfie [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1962</TIMEX>] at least
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">partially</ENAMEX> replaces surfer in its turn though it invokes
the image of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">âmonosyllabic cretinâ</ENAMEX> who speaks
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>-- yeah and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> --streaks his
hair with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clairol</ENAMEX>, and, worst of all, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks milk</ENAMEX>.  In
other words, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bondi</ENAMEX> surfie , dated as it now is, is for
many still predominant.

            Frequenting the surf entailed sun-baking [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1910</TIMEX>],
without fear of the consequences, and shooting
[<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>] waves, with the ambition of âscraping your
nose, after a shoot, on the sand of the beach itself,â
or cracking a beacher [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>].  Refinements of both
activities have been made over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX>-surfing
[<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</TIMEX>] is distinguished from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>-surfing
(or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>-riding ), though the latter use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> ,
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> recorded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Captain Cook</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1779</TIMEX>, cannot
really be claimed as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Par</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coarse</ENAMEX>



            When my eye came a cropper on the word
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ornariness</ENAMEX> in a headline in the (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> and
Mail , I was pretty sure it was either a misspelling or
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>'s plain orneriness.  Nearly all current dictionaries
bore out my first suspicion.  They gave the
root word as ornery , admitting no variants.  The exception
was the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX> , which
listed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> obsolete <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">variants</ENAMEX>, including ornary which,
as it turns out, is the most etymologically logical.
The adjective, which now means `contrary or obstinate,'
was originally just a lazy pronunciation of ordinary .
That is also what it meant.  The earliest recorded
use is an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1816</TIMEX> quotation from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Historical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>The land is old, completely
worn out, the farming extremely ornary in general.â
An <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1849</TIMEX> citation mentions a âone-horned <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX>,
mighty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">onnery-lookin</ENAMEX>'.â  By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>, the spelling
had regularized to ornery , and the meaning had degenerated
to `disagreeable' or `cantankerous.'  This
pejorative development was not extraordinary, because
the word ordinary had itself taken on a debased
sense.  Among the definitions listed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samuel</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX> in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary were, âmean</ENAMEX>, of low
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rank</ENAMEX>, ugly, not handsome.â

            It is probably a characteristic of humanity's
eternal upward struggle that good enough is never
good enough, and neutral terms like ordinary, mediocre,
average, so-so, run-of-the-mill , and indifferent
tend to take on negative connotations.  A classic, of
course, is coarse .  This word seems to have popped
up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 15th century</TIMEX>, as an adjectival form of
course `ordinary order' or `normal manner.'  For
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three centuries</TIMEX> there was no spelling distinction between
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, but the noun was pronounced with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">long âuâ</ENAMEX> sound (COORSE).  The earliest uses of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adjective</ENAMEX> referred to fabrics, to distinguish ordinary
or run-of-the-mill cloth from finer weaves.  But even
before that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> was out, the sense had depreciated
to denote inferior--not just average--quality.

            When the vowel sound in the noun changed
from long âuâ to the same sound as in coarse , a need
was evidently felt to have a spelling distinction so as
to tell the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> apart in print.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaak Walton</ENAMEX> is the
earliest known to have used the modern spelling
when, in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Compleat Angler</ENAMEX> , he wrote of âthe
worst or coarsest fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> fish.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â  Coarse</ENAMEX> has undergone
a thorough pejoration; once it began to be
used for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, in the sense of `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unrefined</ENAMEX>' or `indelicate,'
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full stigmatization</TIMEX> was probably guaranteed.
Now it passes as a synonym for indecent, obscene , or
gross (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> words that have also gone through some
downward sense development).

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ornery</ENAMEX> is one of a clutch of bristly words with
odd and often controversial etymologies.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>
believed that ugly , which was sometimes spelled
oughly , derived from ouph , a variant of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">elf</ENAMEX> .  Modern
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> are satisfied that it grew from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Norse</ENAMEX> uggligr
`to be feared or dreaded.'

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cantankerous</ENAMEX> is even more moot.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Weekley</ENAMEX>
speculated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1921</TIMEX> that because the earliest written
uses are in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldsmith</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheridan</ENAMEX> in the 18th
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, it might have been <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> in origin.  Earlier,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. C. Hotten</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Slang Dictionary</ENAMEX> suggested it might be
a corruption of contentious .  Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> today
accept the theory that it arose from a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle English</ENAMEX>
word conteck `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quarrelling</ENAMEX>' or `contention.'  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent-noun</ENAMEX> would have been contecker and the adjective
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conteckerous</ENAMEX> .  The latter, according to the
currently accepted theory, became contankerous ,
and then cantankerous , influenced by cankerous and
rancorous .

            It is well known that once-ordinary words for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of low birth became debased
through class contempt-- knave, villain, boor , and
churl are only a few examples.  Surely is one of the
very few words to result from the same process, but
in reverse.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid 14th century</TIMEX>, it was sirly `like
a sir,' or `lordly, haughty, imperious, arrogant, supercilious.'
The modern sense of ill-humored or
rudely morose dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about the mid-17th century</TIMEX>,
but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">âuâ spelling</ENAMEX> had taken over about a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hundred years earlier</TIMEX>, perhaps, one fancies, as an act
of revenge by the churls.

            If surly is a product of class contempt backwards,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">obnoxious</ENAMEX> is a thoroughly democratic error;
everybody got it wrong.  The main word noxious is
the harmful or injurious one.  Obnoxious means, or
rather meant, `exposed or liable to harm, vulnerable.'
This sense is clear in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Evelyn</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Gardener</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1658</TIMEX>), which recommends covering certain
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">straw</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>, âto secure them from
the frosts, to which they are obnoxious.â  This meaning
is obsolete, but it hung on until late in the last
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, even though the current sense of `offensive
or highly disagreeable' began to make inroads as
early as c. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1600</TIMEX>.

            Perhaps the most vexing of all these crossgrained
words is peevish.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> just throws up its
hands and cries âDerivation unknown,â adding,
âNone of the etymological conjectures hitherto offered
are compatible with the sense-history.â

            Conjectured ancestors include the Lowland
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish</ENAMEX> peu to `make a plaintive noise' and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX>
piave `to whimper, whine or cry like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>.'  It
may also be related to the bird pewit (or peewit ),
imitating its cry.  Peevish , from which the noun and
verb peeve appear to have been back-formed, has
been used since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX> with a wide variety
of senses, including `childish, silly, wayward,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thoughtless</ENAMEX>, froward, uncouth, perverse' (which
some think is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>), and even `witty.'

            A word with that many diverse senses is about
as extra-ornary as they come.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German Loanwords</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
            Now that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney I. Landau</ENAMEX> has become entrenched
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>
Press in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, we are begining to see reflexes
of his expertise in lexicography and linguistics.  The
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parts of this work, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> part of which is
a dictionary of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5380</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> loanwords in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>,
begins with a useful Introduction that provides the
book with just the right setting, then goes on in Part
I with An historical overview by semantic fields and,
in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Part II</ENAMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linguistic</ENAMEX> overview, which treats
matters like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phonology</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graphemics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grammar</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Word-Formation Processes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semantics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naturalization</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dialect</ENAMEX>.  Part <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> consists of an Appendix
and a supplementary list of loanwords.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">dictionary section</ENAMEX> contains dates (where
applicable), etymologies, and descriptive definitions.
As is to be expected, most of the entries are
scientific--that is, not particularly gemutlich ; some
may be disputable, as in the cases of words like geochemistry,
geomedicine, geophyte, geoscience, etc.,
which are described as translations from German
Geochemie, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geomedizin, Geophyt</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geowissenschaft</ENAMEX> ,
respectively: unless such formation is acknowledged
by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> in their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> manifestations
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> text, these (and others) could just as well
have been <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> coinages and many are so characterized
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> dictionaries.  An outstanding exception
is geopolitics , acknowledgedly from German
Geopolitik , but even in that case there are antedating
overtones from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.  Such
things are arguable, and it is neither useful nor interesting
to try to settle trivialities.  But one is given to
wonder about the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geiger</ENAMEX> counter ,
which we know is a radiation counter developed by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Geiger</ENAMEX> (evidently working
with someone named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MÃ¼ller</ENAMEX>, whose given name
appears to have disappeared but who once shared
the honors, as the former name of the device was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geiger-MÃ</ENAMEX>¼ller counter ): this is described as a translation
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geigerzahler</ENAMEX> [lit. `<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geiger</ENAMEX> counter'] (replacing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geigerrohr</ENAMEX> [lit.  `<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geiger tube</ENAMEX>']), but how it can be so
analyzed, when the counter sense is inherent in the
function of the device, and `<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geiger</ENAMEX>' can scarcely be
said to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">âtranslationâ</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geiger</ENAMEX> , is a little hard to
justify.  As the term arose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only about seventy years</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>, it is probably well documented.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">W.</ENAMEX>) MÃ¼ller
crops up again in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geiger</ENAMEX>-Muller threshold (also
called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geiger</ENAMEX> threshold ), not listed in the book, and
in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geiger-Muller tube</ENAMEX> (which is the heart of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">counter</ENAMEX> ).

            Curiously, there are only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">118</NUMEX> words pertaining
to Physics among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">loanwords</ENAMEX> cited, and one
would have expected more.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geology</ENAMEX>, for instance,
yields <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">318</NUMEX> terms, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Mineralogy 857, Chemistry 687,</ENAMEX>
and a surprisingly meager <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pharmacology</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Aspirin</ENAMEX>
is, of course, of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> origin but appears in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicine</ENAMEX> rather than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmacology</ENAMEX> listings.
Including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miscellany</ENAMEX>, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semantic Fields</ENAMEX>
listed, by category and alphabetically.

            Although almost all dictionaries are organized
alphabetically, there are many ways to look at lexicon,
and the analytical categories set forth by Pfeffer
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cannon</ENAMEX> in this book are interesting and useful.
Other semantic categories have been set forth by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roget</ENAMEX>; still others by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Thesaurus</ENAMEX> ; and
thematic arrangements have appeared in words like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Picturesque Expressions</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allusions</ENAMEX> , and other books
prepared by and under the direction of this reviewer.
How interesting and useful it would be to
see a substantial segment of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">âordinaryâ English</ENAMEX> subjected
to such treatment--and it is not difficult to
imagine still more categories into which words could
be divided.

            If I have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> cavil with the book, it is that there
is no conceivable reason for the subtitle to use an
before historical.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Wellerisms</ENAMEX>
            Wellerisms are, essentially, what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
would call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Swifties</ENAMEX>.  For instance:


âLaugh that off,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â</ENAMEX> said the fat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, as she
sewed his vest button on with wire.

            

            It gets worse--far worse.  Not only are the puns
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">atrocious</ENAMEX> (which is not a legitimate complaint, I suppose),
but they are often obscure, many having been
dredged up from collections that include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18th</NUMEX>- and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> examples:


âBar that,â as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheriff</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> said to his first
floor window.  [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1841</TIMEX>]

âI have risen from the bar to the bench,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â</ENAMEX> said a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, on quitting the profession and taking up
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shoemaking</ENAMEX>.

            

            Pretty bad, eh?  How about:


âI have to hear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> talk behind one's back,â as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">robber</ENAMEX> said when the constable called, âStop
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">thief!â</ENAMEX>  [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1861</TIMEX>]

            

            It seems clear from the above that one must be seeking
something other than amusement from collecting
such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mieder</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kingsbury</ENAMEX> are highly
respected par(o)emiologists (`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> in the field of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proverbs</ENAMEX>' for those who have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHD Unabridged</ENAMEX> ,
which does not list the word or any of its congeners),
hence one would assume that such a collection is not
entirely a waste of time.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Preface</ENAMEX> describes the
book as âthe first book-length collection of wellerisms
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">languageâ</ENAMEX>; unless reasoning man
can find a way to put this information to good and
useful purpose, it may well be the last.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proverbs</ENAMEX> can
be interesting because they are a key to human wisdom
and folly; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wellerisms</ENAMEX> seem to have no redeeming
qualities.

            This reflects an admitted prejudice against the
material, which is about as quippy and clever as the
brick-wall comedians one must suffer on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">odd nights</TIMEX>
on obscure cable channels in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>.  Further on in
the Preface one reads that âmajor collections of wellerisms
in some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> languages are
readily availableâ and the implication that what we
have here is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">ârich British</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX>.â  According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> , a wellerism
is âa form of comparison in which a familiar
saying or proverb is identified, often punningly,
with what was said by someone in a specified but
humorously inapposite situation.â  It is on a par with
the literal interpretation of idioms, as in the cartoon
of someone puffing on a chain with the caption
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">âChainsmoker.</ENAMEX>â

            There are many things about modern life--air
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conditioning</ENAMEX> (in particular), electricity, indoor
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plumbing</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarkets</ENAMEX>--that make me grateful to
be living in the latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX> and
not back in the antediluvian or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>good oldâ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> so
often pined for, and one of them is the knowledge
(gained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Introduction</ENAMEX>) that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> published numerous short
lists of wellerisms during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>.  It ineluctably
reminds me of the favorite execrable pun
perpetrated by those who seem to be in the throes
of learning <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>:  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">âLet</ENAMEX>'s throw a little light on the
subject,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> as he turned on the lamp.  It
is one thing to utter little truisms here and there
during one's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</TIMEX>, sprinkling them about like sesame
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> on a bagel; it is quite another to make a
fetish out of collecting such tripe.

            In my role as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX>, I must be scholarly and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">democratic</ENAMEX>, so I shall be happy to publish in a future
issue of VERBATIM a rebuttal either from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wellerisms</ENAMEX> or from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX> of their cause.  It
may not exceed the length of this review: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">580</ENAMEX>
words.

(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gale Research Company</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>), a compendious
work indexing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 250,000</NUMEX> idioms and phrases, is
missing from the rather eclectic Bibliography
(where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Logan Pearsall Smith</ENAMEX>, quoted at the beginning
of the book, merits no mention either).

            The treatment of idioms is pretty much standard,
with the origins that can be found in other
works repeated: but they are couched in user-friendly
language.  For me, the treatment has the redeeming
feature of describing conflicting arguments
about origins: too often compilers of such books feel
obliged to take a position on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side or the other in
pursuit of âthe truth,â seldom attainable in matters
of language.  Each entry is illustrated by citations,
many more up-to-date than one can find in other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.  More important, each offers--of special interest
to learners of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>--valuable usage notes.
For example, at the devil to pay (and no pitch hot ),
the note reads, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">âColloquial</ENAMEX>.  The full form of the
expression is no longer in use.â

            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cassell Dictionary of Proper Names</ENAMEX>
            It is hard to see what has got into the people
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cassell's</ENAMEX>, for here is another book--this time a
superior one--on which they have practised their
onomancy: the original title (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>) was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brewer</ENAMEX>'s
Names .  At least they have not taken to changing the
names of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of these books, and this one
bears that of the estimable lexicographer and
onomastician, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adrian Room</ENAMEX>.  From the origin of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaucer</ENAMEX> to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo Springfield</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Room</ENAMEX> covers
them all.  Although the jacket copy is appropriately
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dignified</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty lashes</TIMEX> to whoever wrote the release
accompanying the book, which cites its appeal
to âtrivia <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buffs</ENAMEX> and curiosity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seekers</ENAMEX>,â rather a
down-market crowed compared to the higher echelons
of literati to whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adrian Room</ENAMEX>'s books usually
appeal.

            The treatments are brief but not skimpy: as
usual, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Room</ENAMEX> says much in a few words, and his terse
treatments are welcome after the long-winded explanations
of self-evident clichÃ©s one must wade
through in reviewing.  There are not a lot of such
works available, especially ones as up-to-date as this
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.  Because general dictionaries either omit
proper names altogether or, if they are included,
give them short etymological shrift, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Room</ENAMEX>'s book
deserves to stand on the shelf alongside the best dictionaries
in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Everyday Phrases</ENAMEX>
            Originally published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>, here is another
book in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cassell</ENAMEX>'s attempts at breathing a little life
into what should have been left to molder on the
shelf.  Some of the explanations are downright silly:


Too many irons in the fire... The phrase refers
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">blacksmith</ENAMEX>'s forge, where if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">smith</ENAMEX> had
too many irons heating in the fire at the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, he couldn't do his job properly, as he
was unable to use them all before some had
cooled off.

crocodile tears...When crocodiles open their
jaws wide, tears are shed automatically from their
eyes... from a natural reflex action.

            

            It is undeniable that to have egg all over one's face is
an âeveryday expression,â but is there really any
justification to waste <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> on such a self-evident
metaphor in such a small book?

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Twelve Days of Christmas: The Mystery and the</ENAMEX>
Meaning
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard</ENAMEX>, who teaches at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Springfield</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College</ENAMEX>, became intrigued with the lyrics to the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> song, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Twelve Days of Christmas</ENAMEX> , when
he <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> noticed the virtual redundancy of partridge
and perdrix , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> word for the bird, leading him
to surmise that the words in a pear <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> could well
have been <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norman French</ENAMEX> for `en a perdrix,' or
words to that effect.  He allowed himself to succumb
to the intrigue and, using his imagination and talent
for research, traced out the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>' worth
of gifts as a solution to a conundrum.

            Although there are several versions of the song,
its earliest record is in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> manuscript in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinity College</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard</ENAMEX>
not only carefully documents his ideas about the various
interpretations that might be given the curiously
anomalous references in the song but suggests
possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">variants</ENAMEX>.  At bottom, his conjecture is that
the entire song relates to a pilgrimage to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>
from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, where (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtle doves</ENAMEX> is interpreted
as `<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">de tour Douvres</ENAMEX>,' whither one must go to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, to `lors <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Liban</ENAMEX>,' yielding (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX>)
lords a-leaping .  Each step of the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> is
increasingly persuaded that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard</ENAMEX> has taken the
right road, but I shall leave the remaining details of
the expedition to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> of the book.  The entire
theory is so engaging, charming, and delightful that
one hesitates to find fault with any one of it; doing so
would be like denying the existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Santa Claus</ENAMEX>.

            Each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Twelve Days</ENAMEX> is illustrated by suitably
warm and friendly drawings by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Partridge</ENAMEX>
(warranted personally by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard</ENAMEX> to be neither a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nom de plume</ENAMEX>, de guerre, nor de chanson).  The
book, slightly less than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8Â½âÃ 11â</NUMEX>, can be ordered
directly.

            In Love with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norma Loquendi</ENAMEX>
            Like clockword--I mean clockwork , of
course--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Safire</ENAMEX>'s books come down the pike,
each inscribed with a friendly greeting from the man
described as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">âthe language</ENAMEX> maven.â  One of the
great advantages of having <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>'s articles in book
form is that associated with them are the letters he
has received from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> which rarely (if ever) appear
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> where his column is syndicated.
The names of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondents</ENAMEX> are indexed,
enabling potential book-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> to confirm
their immortality before sacrificing their ill-gotten
gains.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Barzun</ENAMEX> should, accordingly, buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
copies.

            Those who think that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Safire</ENAMEX> writes only about
politics from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Bureau of The New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York Times</ENAMEX> should be aware that he also writes a
widely syndicated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> column on language for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunday Magazine</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> Times.  Lately, this
column has been focused, a bit too frequently for my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tastes</ENAMEX>, on the jargon that echoes within the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beltway</ENAMEX>--that
is, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insiders</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX>, for the uninitiated.
Another complaint is his detailed treatment
of the semantics of a word, appropriate,
perhaps, to synonym studies in dictionaries (but only
too rarely well done there) but telling most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>
more than they ever wanted to know about a given
handful of terms.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> more adverse comment, this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> for whoever wrote the jacket copy: when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bill</ENAMEX>
(or anyone else) mentions that long in the tooth was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">âfirst</ENAMEX> used in print in an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1852</TIMEX> novel by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Makepeace Thackerayâ</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p.287</ENAMEX>), it does not mean
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thackeray âoriginatedâ</ENAMEX> the phrase.

            Accumulations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Safire</ENAMEX>'s books (of which I
think this is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX> anthology of his language articles)
afford us with articulate commentary on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
usage in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last quarter of the 20th century</TIMEX>.
Other books, written with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, deal with
other aspects of language; in addition to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> novels,
he has written <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> books on politics among which--
curiously--is not included his <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Politics</ENAMEX> ,
entitled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Safire's New Political Dictionary</ENAMEX> in its later
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incarnations</ENAMEX>.  I cannot repress a personal comment
or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, for I have known <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1960s</TIMEX>, I
when his <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Politics</ENAMEX> was edited under my
direction at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1970s</TIMEX>, I
wrote to The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> Times managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthur</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosenthal</ENAMEX>, suggesting that he consider a regular column
on language (to be written, of course, by me).
The idea was accepted, but not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, for Safire
was regarded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> as its âresident lexicographer,â
the man properly qualified to do the job.

            Cursing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>
            Language <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">taboos</ENAMEX> seem to be persistent in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>--more so than in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British English</ENAMEX>,
where, although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> cannot say that anything goes,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> encounters more dirty language on television (in
particular), especially after the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">âwatershedâ</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour of nine o'clock</TIMEX> (which some are trying to
put off till <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten o'clock</TIMEX>).  In this comprehensive study,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Jay</ENAMEX>, who <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Adams State College</ENAMEX>,
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, divides his subject into several
subcategories: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cursing</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Profanity, Blasphemy</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taboo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Obscenity</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vulgarity, Slang, Epithets</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scatology</ENAMEX>.  Although he defends these classifications
by detailed discussion and definition, it is not easy to
apply them, for the distinctions tend to be blurred.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blasphemy</ENAMEX> and profanity , for instance, are differentiated
on the grounds that the former treats â(something
sacred) with abuse, irreverence, or contempt,â
while the latter âis an attack on religion or religious
doctrine.â  These are points too subtle to be readily
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grasped</ENAMEX>.  The term taboo in linguistics means, simply,
`proscribed by society as improper or unacceptable'
[RHD2] , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay</ENAMEX> prefers the narrow, somewhat
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">archaic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anthropologist</ENAMEX>'s definition that focuses on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">âsupernaturalâ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">âritualisticâ interdiction</ENAMEX>.  The
definition he accepts for obscenity is as alegal term,
which he expatiates on to confusion.  In the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>, he accepts a traditional definition of vulgarity --âlanguage
of the common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>... not necessarily
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obscence</ENAMEX> or tabooâ--but that is not the
meaning most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would apply in the context of a
book on cursing.  The perception and usage of these
terms is personal, and I, for example, prefer to use
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vulgar</ENAMEX> to describe current manifestations like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Roseanne</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Butthead</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beavis</ENAMEX> , and other television
shows that exhibit crude situations encountered by
rude <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>; drawings and graphic style, as in
Butthead , some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">âartworkâ in Mad Magazine</ENAMEX> ,
and many of the new cartoons on the television are extraordinarily
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vulgar</ENAMEX> and tasteless, without any redeeming
quality.

            It is likely that one's taste deteriorates under the
continuous barrage of vulgarity: many who <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> admire
the dadaists, cubists, surrealists, hard-edge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">realists</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonobjective</ENAMEX> and abstract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> would have reviled
them, along with a significant percentage of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, had they been dalive when their paintings
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appeared, just as staid, conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>
condemned the impressionists and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> of other
nouvelles vagues .  Is it that we gradually become accustomed
to what we first perceive as trash--as vulgarity--and
become inured to it, or that we come to
understand and, if not enamored of it, at least tolerate
it as a legitimate form of expression?

            To be sure, one is no longer shocked at hearing
hell and damn on radio or television or even reading
it in the press, although both were taboo a scant
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years ago</TIMEX>.  Programs and films that are broadcast
on television after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten o'clock in the evening</TIMEX> are
no longer censored--even in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>--for
mentions of shit and piss , though fuck , which can
occasionally be heard on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> television, has not,
as far as I know, made it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>.
Still, it is worth pointing out that the shock felt was
not at hearing these words but at hearing them on
radio and television, where everyone knew they
were banned.  In other words, the context was inappropriate:
as if one heard his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> say âGoddammit
!,â despite the fact that one said it oneself whenever
something went awry.  The 1930s' <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">censors</ENAMEX>' ban on showing even a married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> in
the same bed or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> putting on his trousers and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zipping</ENAMEX> (or buttoning) his fly seems ludicrously
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prudish</ENAMEX> to us <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.  But the motivations of those
censors, driven by powerful conservative religious
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>, were quite different, and we ridiculed them
even then because of their interference with the everyday
facts of life.  It is difficult <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> to find a film
made in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX> that does not contain what
must be regarded as an obligatory nude scene, and
in many instances such scenes have no integral part
in the plot.  To me, vulgarity means `bad taste,'
whether deliberate (as in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Roseanne</ENAMEX> ) or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unintentional</ENAMEX> (as in the case of crude drawings
foisted on us as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">âartâ</ENAMEX>).

            The chief problem with these and other definitions
is that some are based on semantics (the intent
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> and the understanding of the hearer),
others on usage, and others on referents.  In a subject
where there are no fixed criteria of definition, it
is unfair to criticize an attempt at classification: after
all, we have been putting up with ambiguous definitions
for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> parts of speech for as long as anyone
can remember, yet we find their occasional application
convenient.  In short, the perception of
these terms is culture-dependent, and culture is akin
to language in the sense that while a large number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> might be said to speak a language, we know
that it is made up of a larger number of dialects
which, in turn, are made up of a still larger number
of idiolects.

            To some extent, these social aspects of language
are accounted for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">in Cursing in America</ENAMEX> , but the
study is married by the lack of up-to-date data: some
of the more interesting tables result from surveys
done in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1970s</TIMEX>, and one can be certain that
things have changed markedly since then.

            On the other hand, I found utterly fascinating
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter Censorship</ENAMEX>, which describes--rather
cursorily, I regret to say--several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> cases in
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> were charged with various violations
stemming from their use of bad language.  In
the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> (unspecified) vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dreifurst</ENAMEX>,
more detailed comments is forthcoming, but it is difficult
to understand whether the source of the exposition
that follows is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s or a rewording and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digest</ENAMEX> of the proceedings.

            The writing is easy to read and colloquial (by
which I mean it contains the classic solecisms that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purists deride</ENAMEX>).  Disturbing are the gaps in information:
Appendix I consists of several lists of films from
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939-1960, 1960-69</TIMEX>, etc., totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">73</NUMEX> in all and
showing for each the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">âTotal</ENAMEX> number of [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>]
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bad Wordsâ</ENAMEX> as checked by an unspecified
number of âfilm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> [who] were volunteers
from a college psychology <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> on the topic of human
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â</ENAMEX> scarcely a representative
cross-section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.  No comment is offered
on the selection of the films.  Other manipulations
of the data are described in general but are not
reflected in detail in the statistics.

            On the whole, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cursing in America</ENAMEX> , while an interesting
book, does not go very far in presenting a
cogent analysis of the present situation or its history.
The fault lies partly in the difficulty in securing
funding for proper studies in the area; on the other
hand, one cannot help feeling that studies that have
been done could have been better conceived and
organized.  There is a miscellaneous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bibliography</ENAMEX>,
which seems to include every linguistics book and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> has ever read, and a pitifully poor
Index, containing about seventy items.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pronouncing Dictionary of Proper Names</ENAMEX>
            The lengthy subtitle is given above because it is
the most succinct way to describe the contents.  An
interesting additional bit of information is buried in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bollard's Preface</ENAMEX>, to wit:


...[<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">P</ENAMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ronunciations</ENAMEX> were actually âproof-listened.â
Through <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> made available by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T Bell Laboratories</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Murray Hill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
Jersy, all pronunciations were actually heard
using speech-synthesis technology.

            

            That is probably the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time such a procedure has
been followed.

            The Introduction constitutes a brief but comprehensive
course in pronunciation and a detailed description
of the symbols used, both for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> and
for foreign pronunciations (like that of the Welsh
ll -sound, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> Ã¼-sound and Ã¶-sound, etc.).
The transcriptions are, mercifully, what phoneticians
call âbroad,â which provide the basic information
needed to be able to reproduce the pronunciation, as
compared with ânarrow,â in which detailed phonetic
features are reflected that are useful for specialists
but clutter up the field for ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>.  The so-called
simplified respelling is what I usually refer to
as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moo Goo Gai Pan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of phonetic transcription,
concoted for those too lazy to learn even the
simplest rudiments of phonetic transcription (which
used to be taught in high-school <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Courses</ENAMEX> during
the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">few hours</TIMEX> spent on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">How to Use the Dictionary</ENAMEX>).
The schwa is anathema in this pattern: uh substitutes
for it.  Still, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> must contend with
macrons over some vowels and with the intrusive h ,
which crops up here and there in order to lengthen a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vowel</ENAMEX>.  Although it might be seen as commendable to
make the interpretation of pronunciation symbols as
easy as possible for the laziest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, I have little
sympathy for the policy: in most cases, those who are
too lazy to learn even the rudimentary respelling systems
used in popular dictionaries (like the various
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">college</ENAMEX> and desk dictionaries) are also too lazy to look
up the pronunciation of a name or word, as is evidenced
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> in the utterances of newscasters and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">announcers</ENAMEX>.

            Of some complexity in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is the pronunciation
of r: it disappears entirely in syllable-final and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preconsonantal</ENAMEX> positions in some dialects of English
( harbor /hÃ¤b\?\/); in others, it is reduced to coloring
the preceding vowel or diphthong ( card /kÃ¤\?\d/)
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> /ky\?\'b\?\/); it crops up in words and phrases
that are spelled without it ( law and order /\?\/).
I find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bollard</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superior</ENAMEX> \?\, used to transcribe both the
âoptional r â ambiguous.  Also, he writes, âthe r is not
always completely dropped.â  I would defy him to
find any r quality in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Received Pronunciation</ENAMEX>
of air <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fare</ENAMEX> , etc.  Admittedly, the r might be the
cause of the âlengthening or prolongation of the [preceding]
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vowel</ENAMEX> without dipthongization,â as Bollard
puts it (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. xxxii</ENAMEX>), but that cannot be said to be r -coloring,
which we ought to restrict to a sound that has
some resemblance to the pronunciation of r .

            These are detailed, petty matters of individual
interpretation, matters that should not concern
those for whose use this book is intended.  One
could quarrel with occasional entry choices: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinberg</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comedian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> , is in but not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saul Steinberg</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>, who is far better known--
at least in some circles; we find <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Waite</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX>,
but not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Waite</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostage</ENAMEX>; Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hicks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> who won a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX> prize, is
in, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>, is more important.
The syllabication of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modigliani</ENAMEX> is shown as
\?\ rather than/, \?\ and the execrable)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">often-heard</ENAMEX> \?\ is not shown.
The former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime Minister</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Takeshita</ENAMEX>, is in,
but, as I once observed, nobody pronounced his
name /take\?\/ (with no <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> at all, a difficult patterns
for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>): he was called \?\,
with a hint of a break before the final <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/t/</ENAMEX>.  Whatever
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">âcorrectâ pronunciation</ENAMEX>, no one could argue
that in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is more âproper.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â</ENAMEX>  (What
we need is an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takapouda</ENAMEX> ).

            The form of entry is not uniform: for instance,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pynchon Thomas</ENAMEX>,...; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Park</ENAMEX> would lead a literalminded
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to understand it to mean âThomas
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pynchonâ and âPark Pynchonâ</ENAMEX>; as the latter is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ballpark</ENAMEX>, it is probably <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pynchon Park</ENAMEX>.  Owing to the
broad transcription, no attempt is made to duplicate
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> voice pharyngeal fricative qaf (as in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qatar</ENAMEX> ).

            There are not many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> that come readily to
hand offering pronunciations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TÃ¡n BÃ³ Cualinge</ENAMEX> .
The choice of entry is eclectic: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kotex</ENAMEX> is in, but not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tampax</ENAMEX> (no pun); many common names whose
pronunciations are unlikely to be in doubt are in
also: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> (though the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>
ought to remain), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> (with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> pronunciation
shown), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John Bull</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Doe</ENAMEX> (but not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Roe</ENAMEX>),
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hicks</ENAMEX> , etc.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rembrandt van Rijn</ENAMEX> is in, but at
Rijn one is directed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhine</ENAMEX>.  I doubt that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>
pronunciation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodrigo</ENAMEX> is /\?\/ rather than
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/</ENAMEX>\?\/ and there are inconsistencies between
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> pronunciation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodrigo</ENAMEX> and that of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodriguez</ENAMEX> .

            These details are not likely to affect the usefulness
of the book, however, and it contains curious
items like the pronunciation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roh Tae Woo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S. Korean</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">leader: /</ENAMEX>no\?\ te\?\ wu\?\/ following which it was
deemed wise to put a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">âsic</ENAMEX>.â  It seems that in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southeastern US</ENAMEX> words beginning with shr- are pronounced
as if spelled sr- , something I never knew.
This yields a string of entries, from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shreveport</ENAMEX> to
Shrovetide , in which an additional pronunciation, labeled
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">âesp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southeastern US</ENAMEX>,â is given; I understand
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shreveport, Shriver</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Shrove</ENAMEX> being given these
variants, but who cares how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the southeastern
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pronounce</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shrewsbury</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shropshire</ENAMEX>,
which are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> place names?  Also, the preferred
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pronunciation of Shoreham</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, is
shown as \?\, which is unlikely to be heard anywhere
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>.  The preferred <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> pronunciation
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> , with the c before the t pronounced
as k , is not shown, so why shown <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
dialectal variant pronunciations?  On the other hand,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thor Heyerdahl</ENAMEX>'s name might be properly pronounced\?\,
but I have never heard anything
but âhigher-doll.â

            Many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cabell Greet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> and widely recognized authority
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">phonetics</TIMEX>, was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> (as I recall) on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pronunciations</ENAMEX>.  He had his hands full fielding telephone
calls from them during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>, when newscasters
were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> faced with the problems of how to
pronounce the names of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and places like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von</ENAMEX>
Ribbentrop, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sidi Barani, Ploesti</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irriwaddy</ENAMEX> .  Little
has changed, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cabell</ENAMEX> is long gone, and newscasters
(or broadcasting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>), if they want to
learn how to pronounce a name properly can usually
find out by listening to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC World Service</ENAMEX>.  They
take a chance, not because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> is in any way not
reliable but because they might not say the name on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">command</ENAMEX>.  For them, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> who want to make
certain they are using an acceptable pronunciation,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pronouncing Dictionary of Proper Names</ENAMEX> will
prove indispensable.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Happy Trails</ENAMEX>
            This is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Facts On File's series</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictionary of American Regional Expressions</ENAMEX>,
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of which, also by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hendrickson</ENAMEX>, was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whistlin</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dixie</ENAMEX> , which we have not (yet) reviewed.
Announced for future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> are dictionaries of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mountain</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> expressions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hendrickson</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> and a productive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of
books on language, among them <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Literary Life</ENAMEX> and
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Curiosities</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viking</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">American Talk</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viking</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penguin</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Facts On File</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOF</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>), the last of which was favorably reviewed in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,27</NUMEX>].  (Had we been sent a review
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">copy of Whistlin' Dixie</ENAMEX> , we would have reviewed
that.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hendrickson</ENAMEX> does his research carefully and he
writes definitions that are eminently informative and
readable, often including a useful quotation; his entry
for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hogan</ENAMEX> :


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hogan A Navajo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwelling</ENAMEX>, usually earth-covered
and built with the entrance facing east.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">âThe Navajo</ENAMEX> hogans, among the sand and willows.
None of the pueblos would at that time admit
glass windows into their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwellings</ENAMEX>.  The reflection
of the sun on the glazing was to them
ugly and unnatural--even dangerous.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â</ENAMEX>  [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willa</ENAMEX>
Cather,<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Death Comes for the Archbishop</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1927</TIMEX>]

            

            Admittedly, hogan is not one of the more interesting
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entries</ENAMEX>, and, inevitably, there are quite a few such.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> problem the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> had to grapple with was the
very identification of a word or phrase as Western:
hightail it , for example, refers to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>mustangs, rabbits
and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [that] raise their tails high and flee
quickly when they sense danger.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trappers</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American West</ENAMEX> noticed this, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a century ago</TIMEX>,
probably while hunting wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>, and invented the
expression to hightail it , to leave in a hurry, to make a
fast <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gataway</ENAMEX>.â  Everything is plausible except the
business about trappers: the expression could just
have easily originated in the parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America</ENAMEX> settled
earliest, for deer exhibit the same behavior (and, indeed,
their tails are called flags for that very reason);
also, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">antelope</ENAMEX>, and many other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>
have âhightailed itâ for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>.  I fear that
Hendrickson relied too readily on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the OED2e</TIMEX> , in this
instance, for that source mentions mustangs in its first
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quotation</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Speech</ENAMEX> , Volume <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">I, 1925</TIMEX>.
After a diligent search, I could find no earlier mention.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mencken</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The American Language , Supplement</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 138</ENAMEX>) refers to an article on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX> speech; the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX> article was written by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> (and
mentions mustangs), but that is of no significance.  It
is just curious that what one might assume to be a
fairly obvious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coinage</ENAMEX> cannot be documented to an
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier date</TIMEX>.  One might contend that before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1925</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> were not writing much about the West; although
the western was popular in motion pictures
long before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1925</TIMEX>, talkies did not arrive till <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zane Grey</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1875-1939</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Frank Dobie</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1888-1964</TIMEX>) might have used the phrase in their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">writings</ENAMEX>, but evidence is lacking.

            The entries make interesting reading, but one is
given no indication of the frequency with which
they occur and whether they are current.  Do people
still use a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse James</ENAMEX> as a metaphor for any
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>) robber?  We also find a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bat Masterson</ENAMEX> and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyatt Earp</ENAMEX> .  Do courting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> still use jimpsecute?
Do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cowboys</ENAMEX> call <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> plow-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chasers</ENAMEX>?
Many know the tale behind dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s hand (aces
and eights, though their distribution is not specified).

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hendrickson</ENAMEX> cannot be held accountable for
failing to trace many of the expressions to their
source: even though many are not much more than a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hundred years old</TIMEX>, there is no way to document
them.  Still, I should be surprised to find that cosh
`kill, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutilate</ENAMEX>' is anything more than an extension of
cosh `use a cosh [`blackjack'] on.'  Other terms, like
count coup and coup stick , look as if they were derived
from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.  Does a cowboy all the way down
to his liver `a full-fledged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> cowboy' derive from
the damage done to one's liver by the jarring suffered
in breaking <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>?

            These are questions that will have to be resolved
by others.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hendrickson</ENAMEX> has performed a useful
function in gathering the words and expressions
in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place, but it would have been helpful had he
given some indication as to how some entries were
uttered.  For example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6666</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The</ENAMEX> , name of a cattle
ranch: was it <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>?  double <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> double <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>?
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sixty-six sixty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>?  And were (or are) the js pronounced
like h in the scores of loanwords from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Happy Trails</ENAMEX> raises as many questions as it answers:
I have trouble believing that gunsel is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">âcowboy</ENAMEX> word for a braggart,â for which no evidence
is adduced.  Some of the terms are old, some
are quite recent, but, in all fairness, it must be emphasized
that no claim is made that any have been in
use for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX>.

            I am ambivalent about the book.  It makes good
reading and those who are interested in dialect dictionaries
should add it to their collection.  But it
adds little to the scholarship about the West and, if it
had a language, what it might have been.  I fear that
this is merely another in the long series of specialized
dictionaries of questionable value published by
Facts <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">On File</ENAMEX>.

            This book <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appeared in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> under the title,
Why Do We Say... ? , and nothing has been done to
it since except to put on a new cover and title and
copyright pages: even the running <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> on each

with a changed title is not strictly kosher: caveat

            Name-calling



            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Hilaire</ENAMEX> was a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX>.  All
those named after him were male, until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>,
when the fashion for uni-sex names exploded.

            The even-handed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental</ENAMEX> use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria</ENAMEX>
never caught on in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, but the dual <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evelyn</ENAMEX> was
already established, as was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leslie/Lesley</ENAMEX> .  In
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> made no distinctions: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Radziwill</ENAMEX>,
Remick, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Cobb</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey Oswald</ENAMEX>.  There was a
flood of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Billies, Bobbies</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bunnies</ENAMEX> , a short-lived
attempt at a female <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> and, of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hilary</ENAMEX> .

            By the time I reached the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> form, one or two
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">juniors</ENAMEX> were called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hilary</ENAMEX> , but I was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pioneer</ENAMEX>.  Not
always a comfortable position.  Very soon after the
War, I was sent on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">âFriendship Exchangeâ</ENAMEX> to a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.  They had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> and a smallish
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">house.</ENAMEX>  The arrival of a pre-adolescent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>, inteligible
to share a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, threw a spanner into the
works (and probably confirmed beliefs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> eccentricity).
They shared a surname with a notorious
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collaborator</ENAMEX>.  In spite of the frantic bed-shifting,
they were delighted to have an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guest</ENAMEX> to
display.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, not having been invaded, had no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collaborators</ENAMEX>,
unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quisling</ENAMEX> gave his
name to the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">breed</ENAMEX>.  Not many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> (male or
female) are named after him.

         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Applications: To Z</ENAMEX> or not to Z



            Z, as the last letter of the alphabet is one that is
not high on the popularity scale in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language.
To an outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX>, however, Z seems to
have particular appeal to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> of subequatorial
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX>.  In the toponymy of this region (especially
recent national designations), Z seems to have
been accorded a special place of honor unmatched
elsewhere.

            The changeover from colonial to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>Africanâ
names has accentuated the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX> and demonstrated
its unique appeal.  For example, we now have
the contiguous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zaire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zambia</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zimbabwe</ENAMEX>
               , 
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> that previously didn't have a single
Z to share amongst them.  Also in this general
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">geographic</ENAMEX> area flows the mighty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zambezi</ENAMEX> .

            Recent reports in the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> have hinted
that a name change may be in the works for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX>, with the possible remaining of that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">âAzania.</ENAMEX>â  This is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> that once went by the
name of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zuid Afrika</ENAMEX> --an important and well-known
region of which is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zululand</ENAMEX> (also known by its ethnic
name of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Kwa Zulu</ENAMEX> ).  Contiguous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swaziland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mozambique</ENAMEX> .  Further
up the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> coast is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tanzania</ENAMEX> , one of the constituent
parts of which is the formerly independent island
state of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zanzibar</ENAMEX> .

            There are many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> names that contribute
to this linguistic stereotype, places such as
Zongo, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zumbo, Zawi, Zaria, Kolwezi, Mulobezi</ENAMEX>,
Solwezi, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ulvinza, Mazabuka</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mwanza</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ngunza</ENAMEX>,
Nzeto, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nyunza</ENAMEX> , and many others.  Not many European-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toponyms</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> fit in with the theme,
but some that do would include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brazzaville , Luderitz</ENAMEX> ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pietermaritzburg</ENAMEX> .

            In concluding, and with apologies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frost</ENAMEX>, it seems that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Africans</ENAMEX> in the subequatorial
part of the continent would have been attentive to
the observation he might have made that, âSomething
there is that doesn't love a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Z.â</ENAMEX>

         
         
            Escobarring



            It is no longer news for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>
when their media report that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> is, again, under
attack, for it has been part of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> politics to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">denounce English</ENAMEX> in public forums but seek its socio-economic
benefits in private.  A language of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">âopportunity,â</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is certainly the first preference
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who do not let their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> go
without it in their school curriculum.

            Any attempt at imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>,
however, is met with very strong resistance.  This
applies even to the south <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tamil Nadu</ENAMEX>,
whose intolerance of our official language, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hindi</ENAMEX>, is
matched evenly by its predilection for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">state</ENAMEX>'s capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madras</ENAMEX>, as a matter of fact, has an
excellent track-record of having fostered <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> education
and the publication of educational materials
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 150 years</TIMEX>.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A month ago</TIMEX>,
however, a massive wave of anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> protest
swept across this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> following a governmental directive
urging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> to
converse only in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least two days</TIMEX> of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>.  This directive, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School Education</ENAMEX>, was meant to improve the
abysmal standards of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, both written and spoken,
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> level.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directorate</ENAMEX> had earlier supplied small
handbooks in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> for use in government-funded,
Tamil-medium <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>.  Tamil zealots threatened
statewide strikes and a demonstration before the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Minister</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> seeking immediate withdrawal
of the directive.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interestingly</ENAMEX>, the Tamils
who have renamed practically every public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">landmark</ENAMEX>,
road, and bylane after their national and regional
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroines</ENAMEX> prefer to retain âPoes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garden</ENAMEX>,â the name of the locality to which the Chief
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX>'s official <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> belongs.)

            This ambivalence towards <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> is most discernible
in the columns of such <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dailies</ENAMEX>
as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Times of India</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Express</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Hindu</ENAMEX>,
and The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindustan Times</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu</ENAMEX> , for example,
with its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madras</ENAMEX>, dutifully reported
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-English</ENAMEX> protests but also carried in its weekend
supplement for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2, 1994</TIMEX>, a note on âEscobarring,â
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Sathyamoorthy</ENAMEX>, presumably a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tamil</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">âVariety</ENAMEX> and vitality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language
is worthy of admiration,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â</ENAMEX> begins this note.  It goes
on to play with some well-known words and situate
them in familiar <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contexts</ENAMEX>, mentions the language's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adaptability</ENAMEX> and resilience as borne out by
its record of borrowings from such languages as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tamil</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanskrit</ENAMEX>.  Sathyamoorthy
concludes his brief exercise with a suggestion that
merits some attention by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>:


If <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> is playful can it be sporting too?  Are
there many words and phrases which have roots in
track and field games...?  Has it honoured sportsment?...
If not why not start with a footballer?
[<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">AndrÃ©s</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Escobar</ENAMEX> could be the lucky one.  And a
timely one too.  This rising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX> was shot
dead outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Medellin</ENAMEX>.  His sin was to deflect a ball
to his goal....  Death was decreed as his wage.  He
was kicked off.  [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX>]

That was in the heat of the moment.  In cooler
times can we make amends?  Can we immortalise
him with a new word--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Escobarring</ENAMEX>?  It could mean
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tripping</ENAMEX> [up] your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> or scoring a point against
your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>[?].  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judas</ENAMEX> did that.  Perhaps Brutus
too....

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sathyamoorthy's</ENAMEX> examples do not seem to convey
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Escobar</ENAMEX>'s unenviable distinction.  His fatality
brims with a far sadder irony than either <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Judas's or</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brutus's</ENAMEX>.  Escobarring may well be that rare sin of
commission and omission all at once.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> ought to
recall, alongside, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Escobar</ENAMEX>'s words, which closed his
column in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> that carried his obituary:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">âUntil</ENAMEX> later, because life doesn't end hereâ (quoted
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 19, 1994</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">p.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>.).

         
         

            At the end of his article, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">âSome English</ENAMEX> Loanwords
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thaiâ</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Blackford</ENAMEX> notes he has
been unable to find out why the name for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sii Tao Tong</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Four Golden Turtles</ENAMEX>.'
I can't respond to why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX> was translated into
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Turtles</ENAMEX> , but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blackford</ENAMEX> may wish to note that the
original name for The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX> was The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golden Beatles</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul McCartney</ENAMEX> advised in an interview well
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years ago</TIMEX> that the word Golden was
dropped because it was, in his words, âtoo clumsy.â




         
         

            Your review of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Dictionary of Fly-Fishing</ENAMEX> , by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.B. McCully</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>], refers to the âsingle turle,
grinner, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, needle, and nail --all knots used in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tying</ENAMEX> files.â  This is incorrect.  The single turle is
used to tie the fly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> tippet.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> is
used to tie <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> material together.
The needle and nail are for attaching the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> to
the fly line.  None of these is used in used in tying flies.  I
have never heard of a grinner , but have seen many
on the face of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> after landing a beauty.




         
         

            This note concerns your remarks anent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AWOL</ENAMEX> .
My long-past military duty leads me to recall that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> stands for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Official</ENAMEX> , and is not meant to be a
part of without .




         
         
            [Similarly from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert L. Glasser</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX>
and a few other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondents</ENAMEX>.-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX> ]
         
         

            As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, I agree with your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondents</ENAMEX>
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XX</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>] that not guilty does not mean `innocent.'  A
verdict is not an absolution.  But as a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>,
I can provide some insight about the journalistic
usage.  The entry in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Press Style</ENAMEX>-book
for innocent says: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>Use innocent , rather than
not guilty , in describing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX>'s plea or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX>'s
verdict, to guard against the word not being
dropped inadvertently.â




         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cassell Dictionary of Cynical Quotations</ENAMEX>
            Considering the political climate the world over
and the political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who make certain that
into each life a little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> must fall, it would behoove
all of us to become familiar with the quotations in
this book, most of which seem apt at the moment:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POLITICIANS</ENAMEX>

When I was a boy I was told that anyone could
become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>.  I'm beginning to believe it.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarence Darrow</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Politicians</ENAMEX> are the same all over.  They promise
to build a bridge even where there is no river.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nikita Khrushchev</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>

Since a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> never believes what he says,
he is surprised when others believe him.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles de Gaulle</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1962</TIMEX>

POLITICS

Politics, as the word is commonly understood,
are nothing but corruptions.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Swift</ENAMEX>,

Thoughts on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Various Subjects</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1706</TIMEX>

Politics are ... nothing more than a means of
rising in the world.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Johnson</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1775</TIMEX>

The duty of the opposition [is] very simply--to
oppose everything and propose nothing.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord Derby</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1841</TIMEX>

Practical politics consists in ignoring facts.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Brooks Adams</ENAMEX>,

The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Education</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Adams</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1907</TIMEX>

Politics, n.  The conduct of public affairs for priyate
advantage.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambrose Bierce</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Devil's Dictionary</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1911</TIMEX>

All politics are based on the indifference of the
majority.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Reston</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>

I used to say that politics was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> oldest
Profession, and I have come to know that it bears
a gross similarity to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>

            

            I could easily go on--and on, and on--but I
would probably be violating the permission to reproduce
text from a copyrighted work for purposes
of review.  Although some of those whose quotations
have been collected here are tediously longwinded,
most have been brief in their dismissal of much-cherished
and much-criticized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>--LAW-YERS,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEIGHBORS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HOLLYWOOD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSYCHOANALYSIS</ENAMEX>, THE
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOUNG</ENAMEX>--scores of categories are covered.  This is
truly a quotable book of quotations, many from more
modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> than one might expect to find in
other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.

            It would be difficult to compile such a work
without ready access to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mencken</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilde</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaw</ENAMEX>, and
others of their sort.  This book (the possession of
which may become a substitute for reading it, to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paraphrase Anthony Burgess</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York Times</ENAMEX>
Book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Review</ENAMEX> ) should appeal to anyone over the age
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> who has developed a sufficiently mature
sense of reality to become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cynic</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Urdang</ENAMEX>
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chin</ENAMEX>-banging<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">: Tough English Words</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Japanese Teen</ENAMEX> Slang




            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Misuta KÃ´do</ENAMEX> `Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cord</ENAMEX>,' sannadabichi `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">âbitchyâ</ENAMEX>,' hando pampingu `hand pumping,'
fakku-mÃªto': visit a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> high
school, and you will quickly realize that much of the
fast-flowing teen lingo is in actual fact <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  Inventive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">puns</ENAMEX> and coded metaphors abound, and new
words, phrases, and grammatical twists surface each
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>.  What was naui <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ânowâ</ENAMEX>--`cool, awesome,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rad'</ENAMEX>--<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> is suddenly annui <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">--âun-newâ</ENAMEX>--
`definitely out, uncool, weak.'  Those who dare to
use <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s words find themselves ostracized by
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clique-mates</ENAMEX>.

            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens congregate</ENAMEX> in tough inner-city
schoolyards, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roughneck slang</ENAMEX> is called agotataki
`chin banging.'  And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>, as a new generation
of chins bang, ever more inspired English
words surface: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>-play, me-man, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.I.A.</ENAMEX>, CD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>,
cassette boy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>candy, wrestling, bible game .

            âBut where do all these eccentric <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words
come from<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">?â</NUMEX>  the confused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> might ask.  The
answer is that they are not English words but <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>-inspired
words, inspired by expressions heard
on television and by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-understood words picked
up in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> class, then bandied about with tilted
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">semantics</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Son</ENAMEX>-play, for instance, is `masturbation.'  Take
musuko `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>,' the standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> slang word for
penis, translate it into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, add play , and you
have a sprightly and newfangled neologism.  When
tough modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> say me-man , they mean `my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vagina</ENAMEX>':
the me- part is from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> me (for `my')
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is short for manko `vagina.'

            The initials <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.I.A.</ENAMEX> are a form of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.O.S.</ENAMEX>, used by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> who are caught unawares by their period.  The
deceptive letters stand for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chotto Ima Are</ENAMEX>! `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">That</ENAMEX>
just came!'  A CD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> who is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred</NUMEX>
per <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">cent</NUMEX> straight: CDs play on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> side; a cassette
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boy</ENAMEX> has bisexual interests.

            Among the rougher <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>candy means a
`good blow-job,' and wrestling is a synonym for `violent
and coerced sex.'

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tosuto</ENAMEX> (toast), another popular word of nebulous
background means `jealousy': <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toasting bread</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> is known as pan o yakeru; the verb yakeru
`toast, bake, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scorch</ENAMEX>' is also used in standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>
for `jealousy'; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX> computed: `burning
with jealousy ... burning ... burning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> ...
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toasting</ENAMEX> ... toast.

            Another powerful source of new expressions is
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> alphabet, where letters, alone or in secret
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">configurations</ENAMEX>, are used to convey hidden messages:


AAS: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Aitakute Aitakute Shigata ga nai</ENAMEX>.  `I want
to meet him, I want to meet him, what am I to
do?'

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDK</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tende Dame</ENAMEX> na <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ko</ENAMEX>.  `totally gross <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>/
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">HT: Half Think `One-sided love</ENAMEX>'

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">HB: Honto ni Busu</ENAMEX> `plug-ugly'

F: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Feminine `Beautiful</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'

FM: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuck Mate</ENAMEX>

SM: Sex Mate

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>: Masturbation; Masochist

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX>: Car Sex

IC: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Instant</ENAMEX> Couple

BF: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boy Friend</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">GF: Girl Friend</ENAMEX>

            

            New words can also be created by playing with
metaphors.  Fakku `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fuck</ENAMEX>' is used quite innocently to
refer to a major frontal collision between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX>,
while in the gentler kissu `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">kiss</ENAMEX>' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> just
bump lightly.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">BÃ»meran `boomerang</ENAMEX>' is the dumped
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> who incessantly keeps returning, and morumon
`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mormon</ENAMEX>' is the active high-schooler with multiple
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">girlfriends</ENAMEX>.  Bonuresu hamu `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">boneless ham</ENAMEX>' is a
school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> like a chunk of boneless
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ham</ENAMEX>.

            The metaphor comes in particularly handy
when conversations turn to matters of delicacy.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tampons</ENAMEX>, for instance, can be delicately referred to
with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> words such as `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>-bag' tiibagu ,
`cracker' kuraka , `wireless microphone' wairesumaiku,
or `vanilla (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ice-cream cone</ENAMEX>)' banira .  Another
taboo subject, condoms, can be touched on with
playful metaphors such as: `globe' gurÃ´bu, `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raincoat</ENAMEX>'
reinkÃ´to, or `cover for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John' jon</ENAMEX>-kun kaba .

            An even more idiosyncratic trend has been to
spawn new blends by using syllabus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
words with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">syllabus</ENAMEX>:


shite-bÃ´i `horny adolescent': <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> shitÃª
`wants to do' + <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> bÃ´i `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>'

orudo-busu `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ugly old bitch': English</ENAMEX> `old'
(Ã´rudo) + busu `plug-ugly'

gyaru-bÃ´i `effeminate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolboy</ENAMEX>': gyaru `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> +
bÃ´i `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>'

gyaru-oyaji `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl daddy</ENAMEX>': middle-aged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with
the airs and interests of a teenage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'

tero-ko `violent teen': tero, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> `terror' + ko
`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'

oran-kori `without a date': oran `no one's there'
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+ kori</ENAMEX>, the â-cholyâ part of melancholy

urutora-naon `a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> with large breasts':

urutora `ultra' + naon, a playful inversion of onna
`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'

masu-kagami `masturbating in front of a mirror':
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">âmas-â</ENAMEX> of masturbation (pronounced
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">âmasutabeeshon>â</ENAMEX>) + kagami `mirror'; it is also a
fertile pun on the title of the medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">classic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Masukagami, âThe Pillow Book</ENAMEX>,â by Sei
Shonagen

bai-nara âBye, see you later': <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bye</ENAMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sayonara</ENAMEX>;
Sometimes pronounced âbayonaraâ

mesu-teriku `neurotic bitch': mesu `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX>' +
the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â-tericâ</NUMEX> of hysteric

            

            The rapid spread of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> fast-food mania
brought with it even more eccentric words of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> extraction: nakkuru , short for snack-uru `to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">snack</ENAMEX>,' chii-too `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> toast,' ai-ko `iced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>,' aitii
`iced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>,' and ai-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mi</NUMEX>-tii for `iced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mint tea</ENAMEX>.'

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky Fried Chicken</ENAMEX> appears in teen slang as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kencha no Furachin</ENAMEX> , which produced the verb kencharu ,
`to hang out after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky Fried</ENAMEX>.'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hageru</ENAMEX> means `to go and get some <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HÃ¤agen Dazs ice</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX>.'  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denny's</ENAMEX> was playfully changed into zudenii ,
and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donut</ENAMEX> became misudo .

            The single most successful fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> has been <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macdonald</ENAMEX>'s.  Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX> the chain
has mushroomed nationwide into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 1200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>.
High-schoolers call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macdonald</ENAMEX>'s makudo , or makku
for short, and eating the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">burgers</ENAMEX> is succinctly known
as makkuru .

            The most sensitive among this foreign batch of
words is bible play , a clever metaphor imported into
high-school slang from red-light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> and porn
tapes and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bible</ENAMEX> , pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BYEBURU</ENAMEX>, is
a playful extension of baibu `vibe,' short for vibrator .

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">club crowd</ENAMEX> is astonished at the
flash flood of new expressions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX> after year
pour out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and surge through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>'s
trendy computer-game <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> and fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hangouts</ENAMEX>.
Even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty-somethings</TIMEX>, still hot on
the club scene with their flamboyant teen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slang</ENAMEX> from
the late eighties, find it hard to keep up with the
latest waves.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most inventive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> for neologisms
is the cross-cultural pun: the expression that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pretends</ENAMEX> to be <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> but is in fact <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>.  A
white kick , for instance, is a `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killjoy</ENAMEX>': the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> took
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> shirakeru `to be a killjoy,' split the
word in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, and ended up with shira `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">white</ENAMEX>' and
keru `kick.'  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parkinson</ENAMEX> means `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gullible</ENAMEX>, a push-over':
it is a contraction of pÃ¢ de kin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">o son</ENAMEX> suru `Losing
money out of sheer stupidity.'
