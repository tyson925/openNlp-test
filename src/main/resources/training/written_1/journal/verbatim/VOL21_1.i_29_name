               Proverbs are the lamps of speech, boasts an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX>
saying.  The words of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> are coated in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX>:
laments another, as soon as day shines upon them
they melt away .

            Contradictory as life itself, sometimes pointing
out a general truth, as often undermining it, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab</ENAMEX>
proverbs have been gathered and annotated since
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> AD.  The small <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> library
where I work contains a shelf-full, the volumes numbered
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to twelve.  Whittling these down to a single
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> recalls the saying He tried to carry <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">watermelons</ENAMEX> in one hand, which in turn recalls the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who tried to tile the sea .  Instead, I shall attempt
here only a selection of a selection, suggesting some
themes and functions along the way.  After all,
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Grapes</ENAMEX> are eaten <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hair</ENAMEX> upon hair
makes a beard .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proverbs</ENAMEX> may be considered as a rough guide to
local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX>, traditions in a nutshell.  To understand
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, acquaint yourself with their proverbs , or as
another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proverb</ENAMEX> puts it, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> are the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> element
of the world .  Of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX>, hospitality and
generosity among the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX> have pride of place.
The generous heart does not grow old; The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that
receives no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> receives no angels; A rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who
is ungenerous is like a tree without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> ; or, more
succinctly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food</ENAMEX> for one is food for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> cup of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>' friendship .

            Yet if hospitality is celebrated, its pitfalls are
also charted.  He ate the camel and all it carried ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pithily</ENAMEX> describes the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-eager <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guest</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Guests</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> start to stink , or even An unwelcome
guest lingers like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Empire</ENAMEX> .  To avoid
such asides, remember to Speak straight and sit
crooked; or again, After the passing of incense there
is no sitting , the message here echoed by a telling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rhyme</ENAMEX> lost in translation.  [ ba\?\ad al a\?\uuD la
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taq</ENAMEX>\?\uuD ].  Do not let it be whispered of you, You
smile at him, and he brings his donkey .  Which goes
to show that for every proverb for proclaiming in
public, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a couple</NUMEX> more for muttering in
private.

            Another subject high on the proverbial agenda
is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.  My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> and I against my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX>; my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> and I against the stranger is a frequently
translated example.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Families</ENAMEX>, as the proverb suggests,
should be closely knit.  They should also, according
to most proverbs, be large: There is no light
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>; Nobody knows when a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> dies .  Or concerning the elderly,
A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> without an elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is as a garden
without a well .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motherhood</ENAMEX> is also highly
praised: When a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> is at home, his loaf of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> is warm; The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of a mute understands
what he says .

            So far so good.  Aimed in the opposite direction,
we have, Sell your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifle</ENAMEX> , or the
even less wholesome, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Relatives</ENAMEX> are scorpions ,
[ aqaarib \?\aqaarib ] rhyme twisting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of truth.
Similarly, countering the commendable If you don't
have an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> , we have the
less generous In time of famine the old have teeth and
What the devil accomplished in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>, an old woman
may accomplish in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> are the stairway
to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paradise</ENAMEX> is challenged by The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>
had already learned how to annoy its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> , while
undercutting the standard injunctions to marry we
have A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> becomes a porter .  The
existence of many opposites suggests that proverbs
perhaps once came in pairs, to be swopped in a sort
of verbal wrestling, one vying with another or sometimes
combining with it, the idealistic and the skeptical
in balance: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> has a hole
in his heart; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> has a heart like a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sieve</ENAMEX>; Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> may chew you, but they will not
swallow you .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proverbs</ENAMEX> can be equally ambivalent when it
comes to friendship.  Straightforward enough is The
neighbour before the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, the companion before the
road [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al-jaar qabl</ENAMEX> ad-daar, ar-rafiiq qabl aT-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tariiq</ENAMEX> ],
friendship and rhyme going hand in hand as in He
who loves you will chew <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pebbles</ENAMEX> for you, your enemy
will count your faults [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Habiibutak</ENAMEX> yamDugh lak azzalaT
wa \?\aduuka ya\?\ud <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al-ghalaT</ENAMEX> ].  A proverbial second
opinion, however, is found in Don't pray for
your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>'s good fortune, lest you lose him .  Or
again, See <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in harmony, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is
bearing the burden , or the still more skeptical Beware
of your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> twice, beware of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> times .

            Yet the most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Machiavellian proverbs pertain</ENAMEX> to
government, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acton</ENAMEX>'s view of power echoed with a
vengeance: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Always</ENAMEX> stroke the head you want to cut
off warns one medieval example.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> is murdered,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">funeral</ENAMEX> is attended , confides another, the
grisly humor continuing in The sound of footsteps
does not disturb the severed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> .  Advice on the policy
of divide and rule is contained in When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
and mouse make peace, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">grocer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> is lost .  Advice
on not underestimating the opposition is seen in
He who makes light of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> will be killed by a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">turnip</ENAMEX> .  On the need for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm government</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">One rug</ENAMEX>
can accommodate twelve dervishes, but no kingdom
can accommodate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> .  The pitfalls of negotiation
are described in He who gets between the onion
and its skin will be rewarded by its stink, while an
observation on rhetoric, as true of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commons</ENAMEX> as of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Abbasid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, goes, Everything
is cut short except a long speech.  For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ministers</ENAMEX>
of finance there is If <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> is dear, patience is cheap.

            For those in the middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">echelons</ENAMEX> of government
comes a whole portfolio of sayings on the perils of
ambition.  Climb like a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cucumber</ENAMEX>, fall like an aubergine;
Stretch your feet only as far as your blanket allows;
No <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> has reached the sky; The foot that is too
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">swift</ENAMEX> must be cut off; He who eats the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX>'s raisins
must give him dates, or, put another way, A man
without cunning is like an empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">matchbox</ENAMEX>.

            The great mass of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proverbs</ENAMEX>, though, are for the
lips of the governed, those proverbial underdogs.  A
streetwise realism prevails, if not downright subversion:
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> lie in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX>'s head impedes a dozen
truths; There's no security in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> things: the sea, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sultan</ENAMEX>, and time.  Expectations are generally low in
accordance with When you make your bed on the
floor you don't fall out.  When speaking out is perilous‚Äî‚Äî
Who should tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lion</ENAMEX> that he has bad
breath?; Complain to the bow and it will send an arrow‚Äî‚Äîother
means are required: When you have a
favor to ask of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>, call him Sir, or, summing
up the nature of hierarchies down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ages</TIMEX>, The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prince</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> is also a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prince</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deference</ENAMEX> is not the
only means: Money delivers the djinni bound, assures
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> others snigger that A bribe (a) takes down
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX>'s trousers, (b) unwinds his turban.  If economy
with the truth is one proverbial option‚Äî‚ÄîNever
tell the truth unless you have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> foot in the stirrup‚Äî‚Äî
as a general policy that is not without dangers also:
The rope of untruth is short.

            Safeguarded by their anonymity, proverbs have
a way of reaching awkward <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> truths shunned by
other texts.  Leave the moral high ground to poets,
sultans, and the powers that be: Keep away from
trouble and sing to it, suggests one saying; but most
warn that trouble will come anyway.  In the timeless
land of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">proverbs Murphy's‚Äî‚Äîor</ENAMEX>, if you will, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah's‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄîLaw
rules: Start selling turbans and people
will be born without <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX>; If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasant</ENAMEX> were made of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>, his balls would be made of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brass</ENAMEX>.  In the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vein</ENAMEX>, I went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Damascus</ENAMEX> to rid myself of worries;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Damascus</ENAMEX> was full of worries, or, in a phrase, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">One</ENAMEX>
grape, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> wasps.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almighty</ENAMEX> might provide
the dervish with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>, but conversely He
sends almonds to those without teeth.

            All this might be depressing, until we remember
how proverbs also have an inbuilt skepticism about
themselves.  Better a neat lie than a sloppy truth hints
how rhyme, that proverbial standby, can get the better
of reality.  Proverbial truth is nothing if not
many-sided, experience winning out over language
for its own sake.  The tongue of experience is truest,
confirms one with due humility: Ask a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of experience
and not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>.  Throughout the individual
is given his due, experience seen as a sort of leveler:
There is no tree the wind has not shaken; He whose
hands are in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is not like him whose hands are in
fire; or, taken a stage further, An imbecile can manage
his own affairs better than a wise man the affairs
of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.

            Perhaps it is in the light of this that we should
understand the saying, Seek advice from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a thousand</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, ignore the advice of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> more, then return
to your original decision.  The limitations of languages
are again brought <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in A thousand curses
do not tear a tobe [a shapeless, shirtlike garment];
or, most majestically of all, in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs bark</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">caravan</ENAMEX> passes.  Behind the telling proverb is a salutary
regard for something infinitely more powerful.
If I have regretted keeping quite once, I have regretted

            Stress




            To paraphrase the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> proverb: it's the
stress that makes the meaning.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hyperbole,</ENAMEX>
perhaps, but consider the following:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)  a big red house
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)  a big red house
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)  a big red house
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>)  a big red house
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>)  a big red house

            

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third and fourth</TIMEX> phrases, a comparison with
other kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is implied and, in the last, with
other kinds of building.  Each version conveys a
slightly different and easily distinguishable meaning.
In like manner, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> is one who
teaches <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>; a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>  is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> who teaches something; a grave -digger is
a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>; a grave digger is a solemn
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archaelogist</ENAMEX> or perhaps a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">single-minded dog</ENAMEX> with a
bone; and a head shrinker is not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> -shrinker
but a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief launderer</ENAMEX> of woolens.

            Sometimes a change of stress does not alter the
meaning.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> or, at least, those heard
on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> often emphasize certain phrases differently
from their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cousins</ENAMEX>.  Thus, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> announcers,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> , while, to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>; and I once heard a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcer</ENAMEX> say
 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prometheus Bound</ENAMEX> when an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> would have
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prometheus Bound</ENAMEX> .  As far as I can discover,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hono</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX>) r-bound and north-bound are stressed in the
same way on both sides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>, that is, by
both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> ( not the same as
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> ).

            Recently, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>, a television advertisement
for a large paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> ended thus: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúX Company:</ENAMEX>
Caring about the state we're in .<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Normally</ENAMEX>, the primary
stress would fall on caring with a secondary
stress on state .  By stressing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, with a secondary
stress on in, the advertisement gave‚Äîor tried to
give‚Äîthe impression that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X Company</ENAMEX>, however it
may be viewed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX>, really cares
about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>.

            Another, nationally aired series of advertisements
relied on some wordplay achieved by wrongly
stressing the first word of the name of a breakfast
food whose pseudo-colloquial garble I will not dignify
by quoting.  Ordinarily, in the phrase nut and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX> ,
both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nouns</ENAMEX> would bear equal emphasis.  In the advertisement,
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> was stressed, yielding, Nothing,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">honey</ENAMEX>.  Ah, well.  A kind of rapture of the deep
seizes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> of advertisements when they try to
plumb the public's tolerance of inanity.

            The confusion caused by such differently or
wrongly placed emphasis in a phrase is likely to be
short-lived and on a level with unfamiliar prounciations
such as congratul at ory, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">con jure</ENAMEX> , con temp late,
disci plin ary, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la bor</ENAMEX> at<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">'ry</NUMEX>, and vag ar y.  Nor is communication
really disrupted even by those new, semiliterate
Americanisms: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">communic ant</ENAMEX> , consult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ant</ENAMEX> , defend <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ant</ENAMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> or, elect or (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>), jur or , where the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">schwa</ENAMEX> (as a in above, e in her ) has been replaced by
broad (- <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ant</ENAMEX> ) or rounded (- or ) vowel sounds.  Other,
often dialectal aberrations such as in surance and in flu ence
are also readily understandable.  The same,
however, cannot be said either of the recent and increasingly
common <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">af flu ence</ENAMEX>, barely, if at all, distinguishable
from the similarly mis-stressed ef <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">flu ents</ENAMEX>,
or of defuse , when a failure to place nearly equal
emphasis on both syllables leads to the word's being
mistaken for the verb diffuse .

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, according to The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford Companion</ENAMEX>
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The BBC Pronunciation</ENAMEX>
Unit has made some changes in its recommendations
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broadcasters</ENAMEX>, who are now being
advised, among other things, to stress the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> instead
of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> syllable of controversy ; the second
syllable of dispute as both verb and noun; and
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> syllable of cervical , instead of the second
(with - i - as in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> ).  Presumably, urinal (- i - as in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> ) is now also stressed on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> syllable.  I suspect
that the new policy, rather than being a reflection
of changes in the speech of literate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Britons</ENAMEX>, is a
nod‚Äîor perhaps a resigned shrug‚Äîin the direction
of overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>, since the new pronunciations
conform with those of at least some overseas
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>, among them, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>.

            Yet, with the exceptions of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">af flu ence</ENAMEX>, defuse,
and, for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, the now-disapproved cervical,
these examples of difference in stress can be said to
be no more than small blips in the smooth flow of
ideas.  Far more confusion is being caused by the
insidious loss of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-syllable stress in words that
are both verbs and nouns.  Of course, there are
words that are pronounced and stressed exactly alike
in both syntactical uses: accord, control, decree, dismay,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>; but these words appear to be in the minority.
More numerous are those transformed by
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-syllable stress from verbs to nouns or, less commonly,
to adjectives.  Examples are:


abstract   consort    impress   purpose
address    contest    object    record
compact    contract   <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pervert</ENAMEX>   subject
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compress</ENAMEX>   frequent   purport   suspect

            

            Sometimes, even these verbs may be stressed on the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> syllable by way of contrasting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> actions or
conditions, as in, it has de creased, not in creased.

            While such distinctions have no effect on our
understanding of the written word which has punctuation
to help it, in speech they are useful pointers
to syntax and meaning‚Äîor could be, if only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>
would make phrases like the following distinguishable:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>'s combat      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> combat
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chemist</ENAMEX>'s compound   <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemists</ENAMEX> compound
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">driver</ENAMEX>'s permit      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> permit
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pollster</ENAMEX>'s survey    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pollsters</ENAMEX> survey

            

            Even when one is not given to viewing every
change in language with fear and loathing, it does
seem that any loss of clarity‚Äîespecially on the part
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> and of those who are the principal purveyors
of information‚Äîought to cause some alarm.
It may be symptomatic of such losses that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> the
adverb of choice is clearly, used even more often
than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hucksters</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Free</ENAMEX>! , and, since clarity of expression
and thought is seldom evident, this frequent
repetition of clearly can be seen as a kind of
mantra, a prayer that begs our indulgence, asks us to
take the wish for the deed, and, what is far worse,
seeks to convict us of ignorance and stupidity should
we look elsewhere for enlightenment.
         
         
            Slang from Greyfriars




            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighty</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúDead Poets' Society‚</ENAMEX>Äù
was filmed, another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> was shaping the vocabulary
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolboys</ENAMEX>.  This was the unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alias</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Richards</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Clifford</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Owen Conquest</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston Cardew</ENAMEX>, and many other
pen-names.  Truly he has been called the world writing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">champion</ENAMEX> but now is most remembered for his
creation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy Bunter</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Fat Owl of the Remove</ENAMEX>.

            Turn through the pages of his comics, ‚ÄúThe
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Magnet‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Gem,‚Äù</ENAMEX> and the dated charm of
their schoolboy slang lives again.  Copies even found
their way into the trenches of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX>,
so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Richards</ENAMEX> (his favorite name) stamped generations
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1908 to 1940</TIMEX> and even later
when the tales were turned into books, up until the
last <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bunter Story</ENAMEX> appeared in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>, shortly before
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Richards</ENAMEX>' death.

            Although his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> tales were spun around
public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> many of his young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> went to
State <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> but still read his matchless prose with
delight.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200,000</NUMEX> copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúThe Magnet‚</ENAMEX>Äù were sold
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Isles</ENAMEX>.  Even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orwell</ENAMEX> was moved to comment on the phenomenon:


<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The year</TIMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1910 or 1940</TIMEX> but it is all the same.
You are at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greyfriars</ENAMEX>.  There is a cosy fire in the
study.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> is on the throne and the pound is
worth a pound.  Over in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comic foreigners</ENAMEX>
are jabbering and gesticulating.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mauleverer</ENAMEX> has just got another fiver and we are
all settling down to a tremendous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> of sausages,
sardines, crumpets, potted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">jam</ENAMEX> and doughnuts.
Everything is safe, solid and unquestionable.
Everything will be the same for ever and
ever.

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F.R.</ENAMEX> captures the youthful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slang</ENAMEX> of that innocent
era when life consisted of countless exclamation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marks</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bunter</ENAMEX> is much given to apprehension‚Äî Oh
crikey!, Oh jiminy!, Oh lor'! or when an even worse
fate is expected, Yarooh! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Wharton</ENAMEX>'s favorite
Great pip! influenced many young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, while Oh
crumbs!, or What the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">thump ?</ENAMEX>, or Oh my hat! were all
typical expression in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '20s</TIMEX> and appear in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.G.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wodehouse</ENAMEX> novels also, as both influential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>
had a vivacious approach to slang.  Key words of that
era are cheery, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chums</ENAMEX>, and breezy, all much used by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Richards</ENAMEX>.  His own favorite expression was
‚ÄúAll is calm and bright.‚Äù

            Few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> of school tales were as erudite as
this shy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX>, who once wrote a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bunter</ENAMEX> tale in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, which was printed in an issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Times</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Educational Supplement</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>.  The richness and
variety of his own vocabulary was a good influence
on that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>.  Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quelch</ENAMEX>, form
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Remove</ENAMEX>, was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beast</ENAMEX>, but a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beast</ENAMEX>, a
phrase echoed by many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolboys</ENAMEX> of that era.  He
was as sharp a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F.R.</ENAMEX> himself and
clearly had an effect on the vocabulary of his foolish
and absurd <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupils</ENAMEX>, especially in the insults they exchanged
with each other, copied by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>.
You spoofing sweep! You frabjous ass! You fat duffer!
            

            Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quelch</ENAMEX> would describe the chubby Bunter
as have an extensive circumference , and more verbal
riches were supplied by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hurree Jamset Ram Singh</ENAMEX>,
the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nabob</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bhanipur</ENAMEX>, who acts like a cheerful
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chorus</ENAMEX>.  Is it a go? asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bunter</ENAMEX>.  The go
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fulness</ENAMEX> is not terrific chuckled the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nabob</ENAMEX>.  The
goodfulness of the riddance is great but the cheekfulness
of the idiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bunter</ENAMEX> is preposterous!  This amusing
mix of fractured <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and an excellent vocabulary
was enjoyed and copied by young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> who
relished the ridiculous.

            The pages of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F.R.</ENAMEX>'s schoolboy stories were peppered
with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave</ENAMEX>! and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ware</ENAMEX> breaks!  The jolly old
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bean</ENAMEX>'s got his jolly old back up , so one sees how
smoothly these stories prepared the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> for the
transition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wodehouse</ENAMEX> and encapsulated the idea
of the laid-back <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Englishman</ENAMEX> in the idiom of that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.  Ripping, whopper `lie,' nunky for `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX>,' take
a pew `seat,' on their jiggers `<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX>,' playing the
goat, a measly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">solicitor</ENAMEX>, cad, and rotter, and similar
expressions were all part of typical schoolboy slang
before <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F.R.</ENAMEX>'s tales are brimming
with them.

            As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX>, now elderly, recalled, ‚ÄúErrand boys
were able to enter through the `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gem' and `Magnet</ENAMEX>'
into a new world where the talk was of fivers and
tenners, motorbikes and gold watches ‚Äîthings they
had never encountered at that time,‚Äù so their horizons
as well as their vocabularies were extended.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bunter</ENAMEX>'s long-awaited postal order was a joke
every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> understood, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Richards</ENAMEX> was
clever enough to adapt his use of schoolboy slang to
the changed times.  Before <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> he would
write that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bunter</ENAMEX> couldn't care a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">straw</ENAMEX>, but in his
later novels he changed this to couldn't care less, so
his ear for dialogue stayed tuned into very old age.

            The code of schoolboy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honour</ENAMEX> remained steadfast,
as did the erudite smattering of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> phrases and quotations from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> that made <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Richard</ENAMEX>'s school tales
educational as well as entertaining.  The recent resurgence
of interest in his stories in modern reprints
and broadcasts shows that this archaic schoolboy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slang</ENAMEX> is still perfectly recognizable and acceptable to
a new generation as we near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</TIMEX>.  That
gap between the charismatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of the ‚ÄúDead
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Poets' Society‚Äù</ENAMEX> and the prolific <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Richards</ENAMEX> is
narrower than one might think.
         
         
            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> Loanwords in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX>




            The strangest example of a loanword I have encountered
in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">musically</ENAMEX> derived: dedsmollay.  At first I took it to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> because of its sound, but actually it comes
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean Martin</ENAMEX> song That's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amore</ENAMEX>, which enjoyed
enormous popularity here.  If you recall,
‚ÄúWhen the moon hits your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eye</ENAMEX> like a great pizza
pie/That's amore.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Thais</ENAMEX> chose to hear dead for that
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corrupted</ENAMEX> 's amore to smollay; thus dedsmollay
has been a common slang word for `dead' for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years or so</TIMEX>!

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX> is the only southeast <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> to
have avoided colonization by a western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">power</ENAMEX>, so
there are significantly fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> loanwords in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> than there are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lao</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burmese</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>'s various languages.  That is not to say that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thai</ENAMEX> has been slow or reluctant to adopt or assimilate
words from other languages, but they are mostly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanskrit/Pali</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
loanwords date from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">perhaps</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100 years ago</TIMEX>, exhibiting
steady growth since then with a truly spectacular
spurt over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past twenty years</TIMEX>, predictably in the
fields of science, business and economics, politics,
fashion, pop culture, and so on.

            Here are a few of the more interesting ones I
have come across.  As in all languages, the older a
loanword, the less recognizable it is, so I start with
some of these and then move on.


bam  a pump.

bok  the game of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">poker</ENAMEX>.

heema  snow. [from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Himalayas</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Thailand</ENAMEX>
never experiences snow; indeed, it is such an
alien concept that, if shown a postcard of a snow-covered
landscape, working-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Thais</ENAMEX> say it
looks delicious rather than beautiful.  Strictly
speaking it is not an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> loanword.]

(rote) may  city <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>. [rote means `land conveyance'
and may comes from mail.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX>-
(and I suppose vaguely <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>-) like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> common

(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">reua</NUMEX>) loh rowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>.  Also reua yort [from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yacht</ENAMEX>] used in the sense of `luxury cruiser.'  A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sailboat</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> literally and rather charmingly
translates as `a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> with a leaf.'

(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nak</NUMEX>) sing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lunatic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> in flash motors.  [Nak
means `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>' and sing comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">racing</ENAMEX>]

sow bow  walkman. [from sound bound.  I have
not been able to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unearth</ENAMEX> who coined this or if it
is exclusive to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX>.]

Numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> expressions use jai, e.g., khaojai,

in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dustin Hoffman</ENAMEX> dressed up as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.  This is odd because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transvestites</ENAMEX> are

are not considered‚Äîas they are by some

who climbs <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, picks scabs, disdains frocks,
though less so nowadays.

sexy bom sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>.  Probably an elided mix
up of sexy, sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>, and sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/sek/sy/m/</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bon/</ENAMEX>) because l is not a final consonant in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX>
and if encountered in a loanword becomes n (or
in this case m as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> is also a loanword).

Thus, the present <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> is addressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> as
Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porn</ENAMEX>!

            

            I should like to end with a mystery‚Äînothing to
do with loanwords at all but fascinating nonetheless.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> name for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sii Tao Tong</ENAMEX> `the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Turtles</ENAMEX>.'  So far I have been unable to
find out why but I live in hope.
         
         
            Politically <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Correct Linguistic Paranoia</ENAMEX>



            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 July 1993</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John McLaughlin</ENAMEX>, in
signing off his television program, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The McLaughlin</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX>, apologized for having used the word welsh in
the sense, ‚Äúcheat by failing to pay a gambling debt;
go back on one's word‚Äù [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHD Unabridged</ENAMEX> ] in an
earlier program.  Presumably, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welsh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> had
gone after him in the mistaken assumption that the
word derives from the word <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welsh</ENAMEX> `of, pertaining to,
or characteristic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wales</ENAMEX>.'  The RHD
precedes that etymology with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äúperh.</ENAMEX>,‚Äù meaning, obviously
that there is some possibility of that derivation;
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> etymology is ‚ÄúOrigin unknown.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  Examination</ENAMEX>
of the scores of senses listed in the OED
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welsh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">n.</ENAMEX> , reveals that virtually all are either entirely
neutral or complimentary; the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possible exceptions
are welshcomb `comb one's hair by using
one's thumb and fingers instead of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comb</ENAMEX>' and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Welsh cricket</ENAMEX> `louse.'  Of the latter type many examples
could be listed on the order of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> pennant
`untidy loose end of a rope.'  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHD</ENAMEX> labels the
term ‚Äú( sometimes offensive ),‚Äù which does not mean
that it is offensive occasionally but that it is offensive
to some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> (presumably <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Irish</ENAMEX>).  Have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
raised an international brouhaha at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX> about the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> disease?  Have the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> applied to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
Court of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> disease?
Have adherents to Judaism worldwide taken
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offense</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX>'s harp?  Hardly, though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford University</ENAMEX>
Press went through a bad patch some years
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX> because of the subentry <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX> down `bargain
down in price,' notwithstanding its notation marking
the use as offensive.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> they tell <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> jokes; the same jokes
are told in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX>; very likely, they
crop up amongst the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Croats</ENAMEX>, amongst
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Croats</ENAMEX> about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX>, and amongst the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>
about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Croats</ENAMEX>.  Recently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Bar Association</ENAMEX> delivered an address at
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> meeting decrying jokes about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>,
suggesting that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who had raided a law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and
killed some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in it had been inspired or spurred
on by the derisive attitude toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> that ‚Äúlawyer
jokes‚Äù fostered.  Oddly, it was in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaughlin</ENAMEX>
program referred to above that this issue
was raised and promptly ridiculed as ludicrous: one
can assume only that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaughlin</ENAMEX> felt more pressured
by nationalistic and ethnic interests than by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> ran an article, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúPolitically Correct</ENAMEX>
Nomenclature, or, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">How to Win at Trivial Pursuit and</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lose Friends‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>], by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc A. Schindler</ENAMEX>, that
delved into the subject, particularly with regard to
the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eskimo</ENAMEX>, though I note that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX> name, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eskimo Pie</ENAMEX>, has not been changed to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inuit Pie</ENAMEX>; also, it seems unlikely that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> ice
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream confection</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Esquimau Gervais</ENAMEX>, has been
hailed into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>.  When I was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lad</ENAMEX>, the word nigger
was taboo in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>, but it was used freely till recently
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> (meaning `any dark-skinned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'):
the word <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Negro</ENAMEX> (with a capital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> ) was carefully
used instead.  Then, at about the same time when
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colored</ENAMEX> was anathematized (despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association</ENAMEX>
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the Advancement of Colored People</ENAMEX>,
which has still not changed its name), black was legislated
by that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> to supplant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Negro</ENAMEX> and colored, though I cannot recall any riders
requiring a capital B .  ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cape Colored ‚Äîor</ENAMEX>, more
properly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coloured ‚Äîis</ENAMEX> retained in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>
with a specific denotation of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a ‚Äúperson</NUMEX> of mixed European

in which one must read <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White for ‚ÄúEuropean‚</ENAMEX>Äù
and dark-skinned for ‚ÄúAfrican or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malayan</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>)
There cropped up, here and there, objections to the
use of black to describe things other than good and
pure, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Black</ENAMEX> is beautiful became the catchword
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>.  Is it my imagination or do I detect intimations
that black is on its way out?  In a perfect
world, there would be no need to refer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> by
their skin color: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years ago</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> agreed
to omit mention of an individual's color, but they got
round that by showing a photograph; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, television
newscasters avoid irrelevant mention of skin
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX>, but they seem almost relieved to be able to
show a picture of someone being arrested and of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">looters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rioters</ENAMEX>.

            Gone is the time when one might make a reasonably
accurate guess at a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s race or nationality
by his name; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> who do not adopt
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> names or names like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franklin D. Roosevelt</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> might be named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelly</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> born as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> change their name to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monteverdi</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hirsch to Cerf</ENAMEX>, and so forth, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slavic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> names either change its spelling in
an attempt to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to pronounce it as closely as
possible to the original (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kovalsky</ENAMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kowalski</ENAMEX> )
or keep the spelling and change the pronunciation
because they get tired of telling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that Modigliani
is properly pronounced [\?\m√¥dƒì\?\ly√§nƒì] (or,
Anglice, [\?\m√¥dƒì\?\ly√§nƒì]) and not ‚Äúmuh\?\diglee\?\ahnee,‚Äù
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castagno</ENAMEX> is easily pronounced [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">k√§st√§ny√¥</ENAMEX>], or that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Zajac</ENAMEX> is pronounced [\?\<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">z√§y√§ntz</ENAMEX>]
rather than ‚ÄúSay, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jack‚Äù</ENAMEX>: after all, there might still be
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">old-timers</ENAMEX> who remember the film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Signe</ENAMEX>
Hasso as well as words like sign, assign, consign, condign,
malign, deign, feign, reign, etc., hence know
that in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">medial - gn -</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">- g -</ENAMEX> is not always articulated.
I number such items among the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Perils of Literacy</ENAMEX>: it
is mainly since they learned to read that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have
begun to change the standard pronunciations of
words and names according to their spellings, a dangerous
bit of mischief for a language like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>.

            Any restrictive tampering with language in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America</ENAMEX> immediately prompts a knee-jerk reaction
invoking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX>, which it would not
be inappropriate to quote here:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> shall make no law respecting an establishment
of religion, or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of people
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peaceably</ENAMEX> to assemble, and to petition the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX>
for a redress of grievances.

            

            Is it only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> that special interest groups
have learned to lobby for preferential treatment and
attempt to legislate the language?  The recent
change in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> by which <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> is allowed alongside
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as an official language is seen by some as
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balkanization</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cherished ‚Äúmelting pot‚Äù</ENAMEX>; but
those holding that view who support it with the
claim that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> have assimilated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">culturally</ENAMEX> and speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> are wrong: many
speak little or no <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, and most make every effort
they can to retain the cultures of their respective
native lands, including religious observances.
One might be led to think that it is always open
(silly) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> on the language in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>; but we cannot
ignore the seriousness of religious taboos on
some aspects of language and writing, as the fatwah
issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ayatollah Khomeini</ENAMEX> on Salman
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rushdie</ENAMEX> because of a book.  In a macabre way, one
might take heart from the news that books could still
be perceived to have such an impact; my own cynical
view is that had it not been for the attention
drawn to it by the fatwah, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satanic Verses</ENAMEX> would not
have had much effect and would have been long forgotten
by now.  In other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> kill each
other over language.

            There are a lot of offensive words in the language,
but far worse are the offensive ways in which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> put those words together to express offensive
ideas.

         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúSchindler</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">List‚Äù of Ashkenaz</ENAMEX>'s Names




            Back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-80s</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keneally</ENAMEX>'s book
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schindler</ENAMEX>'s List first came out, an eerie experience
happened to me.  I was intrigued by the book;
over and above the coincidence of names, to be
sure, but having the same, relatively rare name as
the book's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protagonist</ENAMEX> led to a forceful lesson in the
power of Name.

            I happened to buy the book at a bookstore in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Laguardia Airport</ENAMEX>.  I paid for it with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">credit</ENAMEX> card, and when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> saw my name on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">credit</ENAMEX> card, her eyes widened.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúMr.</ENAMEX> Schindler,
please‚Äîlet me shake your hand!‚Äù  I was very embarrassed
and could feel my face flush.  I protested
that I was no relation to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oskar Schindler</ENAMEX>, but this
did not seem to make any difference to her.  ‚ÄúI'm
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish</ENAMEX>,‚Äù she explained, ‚Äúand it's enough for me to
touch the name.‚Äù

            Ironically, given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oskar Schindler</ENAMEX>'s role in saving
the lives of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Czechoslovakia</ENAMEX>, the
name is not exclusively a gentile <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> name.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Some months ago</TIMEX>, the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rabbi</ENAMEX> of conservative
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judaism</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> wrote a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> commenting on a review of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spielberg</ENAMEX> movie‚Äîthe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rabbi</ENAMEX>'s name is also
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schindler</ENAMEX> (again, no relation!).  On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> occasions,
while applying for visas to a certain <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, I have been asked to provide a baptismal
certificate, presumably to determine whether I was
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish or Christian</ENAMEX>, which happens to play an unofficial
role in the entry practices of that particular
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">About a decade ago</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> airplane
was hijacked by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>, who tried
to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> by the names
in their passports, on the theory that those ending in
- stein or - berg were clearly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>.  A German-speaking
stewardess, drafted into an interpretive
role by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>, played a heroic role by insisting
that all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germanic</ENAMEX>-sounding names were
really ‚Äúpure‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>.

            Is there in fact such a thing as a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> name?
More specifically, are there unique or typical names
borne by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ashkenazi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> from central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>?
Aside from nobility, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> of German-speaking
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">central Europe</ENAMEX> started taking family names
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</TIMEX>.  As in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, these names fell
into various categories (the following is not meant to
be exhaustive, just illustrative):


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">occupations</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weaver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cartwright</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">etc. German</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rademacher, Schmidt</ENAMEX>, etc.
patronyms: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX>, etc.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patronyms</ENAMEX> are not as common in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>)

place names: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Churchill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX>, etc. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adenauer, Hindenburg</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waldheim</ENAMEX>, etc.

personal characteristics: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Black</ENAMEX>,
Lionheart, etc. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwarz</ENAMEX>,
Liwenherz, etc.

            

            However, at the time that commoners started taking
names, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> were forced to live in special ghettoes.
Depending on the nature of the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liege lord</ENAMEX>, that
was partly for their own protection and partly so
they could be controlled.  The restrictions of the
ghetto were not only geographical: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> were
usually restricted in the trades they could engage in.
Crafts were usually not allowed, since the craft
guilds excluded <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>; but <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> were allowed to engage
in banking (and related industries, such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pawnbroking</ENAMEX>), mercantile pursuits, and long-distance
trading.

            As the symbol of the pawnbroker was the three
gold balls (ef. the family arms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothschilds</ENAMEX>),
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldstein</ENAMEX> (`<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold stone</ENAMEX>') became a popular name for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pawnbrokers</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> (often there was little difference
between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> trades).  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kr√§mer</ENAMEX> was a
small-scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">merchant</ENAMEX>, the prefix Mandel - usually indicated
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> in almonds, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernstein</ENAMEX> is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> word for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">`amber</ENAMEX>,' a semiprecious stone
traded along routes which stretched from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX> up through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ukraine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lithuania</ENAMEX>.

            
               Schindler, on the other hand, was a guild <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> cognate would be `shingler,' or `shingle-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX>,'
and the word originally comes from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> scindere , meaning `to split.'  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> thinks of
splitting a cedar wood block to make what we would
call shakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schindler</ENAMEX> not
only made shakes, he also built and surfaced the entire
roof of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>; so in my opinion, the name really
corresponds better with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> surname
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyler</ENAMEX>.  As a guild <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX>, roofing would normally have
been closed to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the era</TIMEX> when surnames
came into use amongst the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guild</ENAMEX> classes.  Indeed, in
the book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Schindler's List</ENAMEX>, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
named <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Schindler: Oskar Schindler</ENAMEX>, the protagonist,
who was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Sudetendeutscher</ENAMEX> (ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>
from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bohemia</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moravia</ENAMEX>); and a Brigadier
Schindler, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wehrmacht</ENAMEX> procurement
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> (who one presumes was not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish</ENAMEX>).

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About ten</NUMEX> or twelve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, when I started
traveling in the course of my business (as international
business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> for a medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>), I
would often look up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schindlers</ENAMEX> in local phone books
and write them to see if we might be related.  I underestimated
the commonness of the name.  When I
grew up, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Prairies</ENAMEX>, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>
were mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WASP</ENAMEX> and had a hard time spelling or
pronouncing my name.  I thought that my name was
unique and exotic, like those of my fellow ethnic
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>- and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ukrainian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX>.  It
came as a surprise to find that there are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schindlers</ENAMEX> in
almost every large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of the world I have visited,
including those in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>,
and even <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>.  Starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about five years</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>, I started seeing the little white service wagons
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schindler Elevator Co.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zipping</ENAMEX> around downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montreal</ENAMEX>.

            I engaged in many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Briefwechsel</ENAMEX> with Schindlers
(and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shindlers</ENAMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Melbourne</ENAMEX>
to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape Town</ENAMEX> and found that many were, in
fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>.  Most of these have anglicized (or yiddishized)
their names, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shindler</ENAMEX> .  As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shindler</ENAMEX> told me, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">‚ÄúThe German</ENAMEX> language has nothing
but bitter memories for us, so my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> adopted
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> spelling when we moved here after the
War.‚Äù

            How this exception to the rule occurred is impossible
to determine, but it is not really difficult to
imagine that it could easily have happened over the
course of centuries of inter-marriage.  I have often
wondered what might happen if, during one of my
visits to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>, I should become the object
of interrogation by someone with, shall we say, an
urgent political agenda.  Would he look into my
trousers to determine my religion?  He would have a
problem, of course, because most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX>
gentiles of my age bear the visible signs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Covenant</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abraham</ENAMEX>.  How would I explain that while
many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> names may look <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, they are not
really <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄîNo</ENAMEX>, I mean, they are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, or,
rather, they took certain German names, but there
are exceptions, you see ...

            I just hope I can convince him my name's really
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.

            Tassie Terms



            It grieves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tasmanians</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Island State</ENAMEX> [or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flyspeck</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Speck</ENAMEX> ] is sometimes left off the map of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, yet no one visiting the former convict colony
can be untouched by the tangible pervasiveness
of the past and the importance attached by Tasmanians
to activities and events which, in mainland
terms, are long gone.  Part of this impression comes
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s increasing dependence on tourism
and its readiness to dress up the differences in ways
likely to appeal to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> from overseas and from
other parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> who feel they have moved
with the times.  The very word convict is more prominent
in everyday spoken <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> than it is in, say,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX>, with compounds like convict brick, convict
building, convict garden, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">convict piner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">convict relic</ENAMEX>,
and convict settlement.  Terms that have validity only
in a historical context abound: carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dumb</ENAMEX>
cell, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Model Prison</ENAMEX>, probation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX>, and separate
prison, or the place name <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Isle</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dead</ENAMEX>, all of
which appear currently in literature prepared for
the tourist trade.  So does the former name for the
colony, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Van Diemen</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land</ENAMEX> (so named by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">explorer Abel Tasman</ENAMEX>), or its facetious variant,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vandemonia</ENAMEX> (former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tasmanian</ENAMEX> convicts being
known on the mainland as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vandemonians</ENAMEX>).
            

            
               Convict piner indicates both a retention of and a
transition from the past.  A piner is and was a timbergetter
who specialized in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huon</ENAMEX> pine, a conifer producing
an attractive and highly valued timber, once
used for boatbuilding but now protected and employed
mainly in the manufacture of touristy artifacts.
Pining was unequivocally an occupation.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">piner</ENAMEX> once lived in a badger box , a makeshift shelter
named in allusion to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wombat</ENAMEX>'s capacious hole in
the ground (the wombat being known uniquely in
Tasmania as a badger, to which it bears a passing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resembalance</ENAMEX>).  This highlights the retention of terms
belonging to the past that have been given a new
and artificially maintained currency as part of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holiday Isle</ENAMEX>'s tourist-oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">self-promotion</ENAMEX>.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apple</ENAMEX> industry provides another example: apple
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chewer</ENAMEX> is explicable as a sign of plenty, but apple
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">carver</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> of a somewhat desperate attempt
to provide entertainment; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Island</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isle</ENAMEX>
is part now of a deliberately created nostalgia for
a past in which there was once a thriving export industry.

            There is a plenteousness of natural resources.
The proprietorial use of the adjective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tasmanian</ENAMEX> ‚Äî
found in compounds like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tasmanian</ENAMEX> kingfish, Tasmanian
pink-eye (a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tasmanian</ENAMEX> scallop (the
shellfish, not, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New South Wales</ENAMEX>, a slice of fried
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potato</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tasmanian</ENAMEX> red (an apple<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">)‚Äîplays</ENAMEX> on an
ostensible difference in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> produce, as does
the much more audacious hijacking of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> in
Tasmanian <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">salmon</ENAMEX> (farmed Tasmanian
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">salmon</ENAMEX>).  Names of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cleopatra</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">democrat</ENAMEX>,
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX> like bintje, black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">derwent</ENAMEX>, and kennebec,
carry a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tasmanian</ENAMEX> stamp (in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> at any
rate), as does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutton bird</ENAMEX> (the shearwater, Puffinus
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tenuirostris )‚Äîwhich</ENAMEX> has given <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tasmanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
the verb <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutton bird</ENAMEX> or in its abbreviated form
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bird</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lexical</ENAMEX> oddities like dizz (`cook a
mutton <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>') for those foolhardy enough to contemplate
such a feat.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">indigenous flora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna likewise</ENAMEX> have
been carefully marketed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> as different : the
Tasmanian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger</ENAMEX> (now probably extinct) lives in legend
and forlorn reaches of the remotest parts of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">island</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tasmanian</ENAMEX> devil (a carnivorous marsupial
of undeniably fierce appearance) in tired zoos and
nature <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> where nonexclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> like the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kangaroo</ENAMEX> and koala share the honors with a remarkable
range of diminutive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marsupials</ENAMEX> genuinely peculiar
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tassie</ENAMEX>, which have added value in an age that
cultivates the notion of wilderness.  Again the tourist
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX> looms with its advertisements for ‚Äúcabins,
complete with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX>-size bed and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa bath</ENAMEX>, and all
with spectacular river or wilderness views.‚Äù

            But there are genuine regionalism lurking in
both the written and the spoken language: corinna
(an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> name for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Tasmanian tiger</ENAMEX>), mariner
(a corruption of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> merrina for a seashell
used as a physical ornament), quoib (an Aboriginal
term for a wombat), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wang</ENAMEX> (again an
Aboriginal term, this time for a fiery piece of lighted
bark thrown by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aborigines</ENAMEX>).  All of which seems narracoupa
`very good' considering the strenuous efforts
made during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Black War of 1831</ENAMEX> to disperse
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tasmanian Aborigines</ENAMEX>.  And there are spoken examples
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> regional dialect survivals: the litmus
test for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tasmanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> is the pronunciation
and use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX>-un an `eccentric.'  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Indicative</ENAMEX> also is
familiarity with pocket , originally a `measure of hops
or the bag in which they were carried,' now used
exclusively of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX>, and nointer a `scapegrace or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mischievous person</ENAMEX>.'

            Tasmanian <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, then, presents an interesting
face to the outside world, partly the face of a genuine
regional dialect nurtured by the stability and
comparative isolation of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, and partly a
construct of the tourist industry, which harnesses
both the new and the old to create a viable contemporary
image.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Verbum Sap The Media Is the Message</ENAMEX>



            I have few data to support me, and my stamina
are not up to long, tedious research, but I have a
hunch that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> ‚Äîthe main agendum on many a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pedant</ENAMEX>'s plate these days‚Äîis well on its way to becoming
a standard singular noun, except perhaps
among hidebound <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">literati</ENAMEX> and intransigent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intelligentsia</ENAMEX>
on various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> campi, in style books,
and in other blessed receptacles of holy semantic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">writ</ENAMEX>.  My hunch also tells me that there are more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who use media as a singular noun than there
are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who write bristling letters to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>
insisting on its immutable plurality‚Äîwhich is to say,
a lot.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> itself/themselves has its/their needle
stuck in the old monaural groove.  Most style books
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stoutly</ENAMEX> maintain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> is a plural noun, period.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Manual of Style</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Usage</ENAMEX> admits
the existence of an alternative but dismisses it as a
subversive plot: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äú Media ‚Äîstill a plural</ENAMEX>, despite persistent
efforts to turn it into a singular.‚Äù  It adds,
with smug ivory-tower certainty, ‚ÄúThe singular is, of
course, medium.‚Äù  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Broadcasting Corporation</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Style Guide</ENAMEX> is also stuck in the mud.  Its diktat
on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> says this: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúPlural.</ENAMEX>  `The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> sometimes
display (not displays) a sensational approach to
events.'  Remember also that data, criteria, and phenomena
are plurals.  But the plural of referendum is
referendums, not referenda!‚Äù  The (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mail Style Book</ENAMEX> not only holds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>'s plurality,
but includes within its wide network ‚Äúbooks, periodical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications</ENAMEX>, radio, TV, advertising, mass
mailing.‚Äù  How did they overlook <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> criers?

            In a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe and Mail</ENAMEX> column, a magazine
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> was taking pot shots at a gun-supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
publication called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women's Self Defense</ENAMEX>.  Among his
targets was a cover-story headline that read:  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúHow</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media Encourages Violence</ENAMEX>, Yet Discourages
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Owning Guns</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>,‚Äù he
tut-tutted, ‚Äúis full of similar grammatical mistakes.‚Äù
I could detect no other solecisms, so I assumed he
was taking aim at the use of the singular verb with
the noun media.
            

            What these dauntless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> of the status
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quondam</ENAMEX> fail to detect is that a linguistically fascinating,
and utterly inevitable, semantic change is occurring‚Äîhas
already occurred, really‚Äîbeneath
their very proboscises (or proboscides for the classically
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rigorous</ENAMEX>).  The result of this evolution is that
there is now both a plural media and a singular media,
and each means something different.  The legitimate
and widely recognized singular meaning was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> recently in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe and Mail</ENAMEX>, despite
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Style Book</ENAMEX>'s taboo.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>'s television critic
began a story this way: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúIt is a mean, cold morning
down at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHCH-TV</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> has been invited
to risk its collective life on the icy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX> [to preview a series premiere].‚Äù
The sense is clear and logical here.  This
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> does not include book <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> and junk-mail
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pushers</ENAMEX>, and no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> would take that meaning.
It means simply ‚Äúthe news media,‚Äù or what
used to be called ‚Äúthe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äù</ENAMEX> used as a collective
singular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 1797</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">See OED</ENAMEX> press n., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> served the purpose well, as long as it involved
only <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúprint‚</ENAMEX>Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>.  When radio and television
joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>, some new collective handle was
felt to be needed.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, in its wisdom, opted
for the nettlesome media, first used in this sense, to
anyone's knowledge, in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1923</TIMEX> article in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advertising</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">& Selling</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúClass Appeal in the Mass Media</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
In the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, the singular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> appeared,
but so did the singular media.  And ever
since, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purists</ENAMEX> have been more concerned about
bad <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> than good <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.

            The language has a way of sorting out awkward
situations, such as those created by the rather tortured
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äúproper‚Äù</ENAMEX> examples in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> paragraph.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>, still in transition, is usually singular outside academic
and scientific settings.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stamina</ENAMEX> (plural of stamen ),
has been singular since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 18th century</TIMEX>
when, like media, it developed a new sense.  Agenda
(which once had the singular agend in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>) has
been treated as one since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of this century</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Literati</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intelligentsia</ENAMEX> retain their snooty classical
endings because it looks good on them and other
pseudo- cognoscente.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campi</ENAMEX> is a joke.  <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> has
just about completed its evolution to singularity.  Criteria
and phenomena, heard everywhere as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singles</ENAMEX>,
are encountering stern opposition from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who
take care to speak of a grafitto, but never say a confetto.
Many of them also talk of octopi, unaware that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">‚Äúcorrect‚Äù Greek</ENAMEX> plural is octopodes or that the
accepted anglicized one is octopuses, the simple English
plural - s or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">- es</ENAMEX> , as in thesauruses, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campuses</ENAMEX>, formulas,
indexes, and memorandums.
            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mediums</ENAMEX> would have made sense, but usage dictated
the plural media.  And, certainly, it is still a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plural</ENAMEX> in such senses as ‚Äúvarious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> are on display
at the art show.‚Äù  But media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unmistakably</ENAMEX> has
also taken on a monolithic unitary sense.  I am happy
to let the usually conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Heritage</ENAMEX>
Dictionary have the last word:  <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúAs with the analogous
words data and agenda, the originally plural
form has begun to acquire a sense that departs from
that of the singular [ medium ]; used as a collective
term, media denotes an industry or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Contemporary English</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Word Lists</ENAMEX>
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1960s</TIMEX>, while I was directing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compilation</ENAMEX> and editing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Random House Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unabridged Edition</ENAMEX>,
it occurred to me that it would be extremely useful
to have a listing of a large number of English words
alphabetized from the right‚Äîthat is, listed in normal
spelling order but with words ending in a followed
by those ending in b, and so on, to those ending
in z.  My primary purpose was to facilitate the
examination of suffixes and desinences.  It was a simple
matter to find words beginning with prefixes like
anti-, pre-, pro-, un-, etc., but finding those that
ended in -able, -graph, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-ity</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-ous</ENAMEX> , etc. was an entirely
different matter.  There was no problem identifying
the obvious ones, but the less common ones were a
bit more elusive.

            As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX> was unable to fund such research,
I approached someone I knew at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Griffiss Air Force Base</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, with my proposal, suggesting that such an
analysis would yield useful results for cryptanalytical
research.  I was summarily turned down in a peremptory
letter that questioned the possible usefulness of
such an enterprise.  I was consequently a little surprised‚Äîand
pleased‚Äîto be phoned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</TIMEX>
later by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.F. Brown</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Psychology</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>,
who told me that he had been called in by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX> and given the job of preparing just such
a list.  It was at the suggestion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> that he
was getting in touch with me, as he had no notion of
how to go about the work.  We met in my office some
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> later, and, being far more interested in the results
than in who did the work or got the credit, I set
forth for him the procedures that would yield the
list.  Although nothing was committed to writing, I
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gave Brown</ENAMEX> to understand that all I expected in return
was a copy of the resulting work and an acknowledgment
of my help in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreword</ENAMEX>.  Several
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years later</TIMEX>, the work was published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight quarto</TIMEX>-sized,
thick volumes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set of which was duly delivered
to my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreword</ENAMEX> was totally devoid
of any acknowledgment, however.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> volumes contained listed solid
words, all in capital letters, alphabetized from the
right, with codes for each indicating which one or
more of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eighteen sources</ENAMEX> that had yielded
them.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> volume listed hyphenated forms
in the same way.  The next <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> volumes contained
the same listings as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>, but these were
alphabetized normally, from the left.  The sources
were (mainly) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merriam-Webster Unabridged</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> Edition, and, in addition, as number of other
specialized medical, scientific, and other dictionaries.
I understand that an attempt had been made to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">persuade Merriam</ENAMEX> to allow the use of the entry lists
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third Edition</ENAMEX>, but they refused.  I cannot recall
the exact number of items in the lists, but my
impression is that it was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 750,000</NUMEX>.  [As
far as I know, the information is still available from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Technical Information Service</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia, U.S.A.</ENAMEX>, either in microfiche or as an
enlarged machine copy of same.]

            As this work is not mentioned in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contemporary</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">English: Word Lists</ENAMEX>, one must assume that its existence
was unknown to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>; but that should
not put off those who have need of a list that is not
only more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to date</TIMEX> but is also more selective and,
on the grounds of frequency, probably more useful.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyphenated</ENAMEX> forms ( heaven-sent ) and multi-word
units ( old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX>' tale ) are conveniently included in a
single listing; though these are alphabetized word-by-word
(putting black <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> before blackberry, taxfree
before taxable ), the list is short enough so that
these are readily found in the Forward part.  I
missed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">black hole</ENAMEX>, which is widely used as a popular
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metaphor</ENAMEX>, and was a little surprised find reported
speech, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Excellency</ENAMEX> (presumably only a form of address),
and sandwich course.  Different forms of the
same word are listed, e.g., exact, exactly, and exactness,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exaggerate</ENAMEX>, exaggerated, exaggeratedly, and exaggeration.
            

            Is it vain of me to suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> might
have found it useful to have had at hand my Suffixes
and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Other Word-final Elements of English</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gale Research</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Company</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>)?  It lists <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1545</TIMEX> word-final elements,
many of which are not represented in the
book under review.  One might well counter that
words containing those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are therefore not
common enough to merit inclusion, but is that suffi-
cient reason to omit - mane words ( balletomane ),
- bund words ( moribund ), and all words ending in
- phobe or - phile ?  I believe that to create a truly useful
work, even acknowledging its restrictions, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> should have considered matters other than
raw frequency, the criterion applied for ‚Äúuse in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">classroom</ENAMEX> or at home.‚Äù  For instance, I am not entirely
sure what purpose is served in long lists of
words ending in - ly that are adverbs formed on adjectives:
a formula would not only have sufficed but
would enable some words, like kindly and friendly ,
to have been especially marked.  Introducing a formula
to cover - ize /- ise variants (and some others)
would have freed up space for more important inclusions.

            Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> suggested uses for the books‚Äî
teaching or learning <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word formation, employing
the list as a source of frequently used words,
and having available <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúonly items</ENAMEX> actually found in
English texts, without the‚Äîoften delightful‚Äîoddities
one can find in larger dictionaries‚Äù‚Äîthe last
seems to me the most telling.  There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23,163</NUMEX>
items listed; those who argue about the size of native
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers vocabularies</ENAMEX> would be hard put to find
any words or phrases that are not familiar and could
very likely extend the list without difficulty.  If semantic
criteria were applied to homographs (which
appear only once), like saw , and to polysemic items,
like take up, take in, etc. , even the most naive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> could expand the list considerably.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About a dozen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, when looking through
a mail-order catalogue of sports clothes, I noticed a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> offering fishing flies and became intrigued
with their names‚Äînames like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cree Sedge</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenwell</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Glory</ENAMEX> .  In a desultory way (I admit), I
tried to discover more about the names, with an eye
toward compiling a work on the subject.  I did manage
to acquire a catalogue or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> on fishing flies‚Äî
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, I recall, was from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard's‚</ENAMEX>Äîbut the entire
project slipped away from me to be replaced by
other matters requiring more immediate attention.
When I saw the present work (in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> catalogue
of sports clothes), I sent away for it.

            I should explain that I fished‚Äîthough not ‚Äúseriously‚Äù‚Äîwhen
I was about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years old</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">summer</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">camp</ENAMEX>, where we caught mostly sunfish; I once
caught a lake bass, which we grilled on an open fire
and ate: only those who have eaten fresh-caught fish
know the difference between them and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>-bought
variety.  Some <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, several
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> persuaded me to join them on a party-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> to
go fishing off <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rockaway Beach</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The day</TIMEX> was sultry, without the slightest breeze to
create even a suggestion of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s paw on the surface
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sheepshead Bay</ENAMEX>; I caught <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about twenty</TIMEX>-odd
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fluke</ENAMEX>, which just lay there, scarcely my notion of
game fishing.  As I had caught the most fish <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX>,
I won a bottle of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">scotch</ENAMEX>, but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX>
viewed with some alarm our return bearing among
us about fifty fluke, all of which needed cleaning
and, of course, either eating or freezing.  I have
avoided fishing since.

            No self-respecting reader of books can consider
his education complete without having read Izaak
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walton</ENAMEX>.  More recently, I have seen fishing competitions
on television, happy to see that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> were
returned to the waters whence they have been
taken.  Most recently, I saw on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX>-TV a most enchanting
film about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who had gone fishing
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúmonster‚Äù</ENAMEX> carp on a lake at a private estate
somewhere.  It was quite beautiful.  One might think
that watching other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> fishing is like watching
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> grow; it cannot compare for action with
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Terminator</ENAMEX> , yet it is far from boring‚Äîespecially
if one is watching an edited version and does not
have to sit on shore or in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> on end‚Äî
and that particular program, punctuated here and
there by fishing lore, was dreamily engaging and
peaceful, well calculated to remove one's mind from
the cares of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>.

            The literature of fishing goes back a long, long
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.  As I know little about it, I shall not attempt to
expatiate on it here.  The present book, although it
is called a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>, contains much ancillary encyclopedic,
folkloristic, and fishloristic information,
most of it carefully referenced to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, which are
documented in an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-page bibliography.  (My
only criticism of it is that the listing for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifteenth-century</TIMEX>
Treatise of Fishing with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angle</ENAMEX> appears as
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> item, under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúAnon</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>: it ought to have a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX> reference under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Treatise</ENAMEX> , where I had sought it
in vain.)

            Typically, an entry begins with the etymology of
the headword, e.g.:


baggot From a verbal participle, bagged,
meaning `big with young, pregnant.'  (Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perceval</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1400</TIMEX>: `The mere was bagged with sole.')

            

            In many entries, the etymologies are far more replete:
that for barb covers twelve lines of text.

            It would be more accurate to say that the terms
are explained, rather than defined; opinions are
given, techniques are discussed (carefully distinguishing
between dry fly-fishing and wet), and the
style is easy.  The entries on mayfly ¬π, mayfly ¬≤, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mayfly ¬≥</ENAMEX>, the first being any ‚Äúup-winged insect,‚Äù the
second the ‚Äútrue mayfly,‚Äù and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, the ‚Äústonefly,‚Äù
cover <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> full pages; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than six</NUMEX> are devoted
to sea <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX> ; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than ten</NUMEX> to nymph fishing .  Mirror
and window goes into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>'s view of the world.
Line drawings illustrate the single turle, grinner,
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, needle , and nail ‚Äîall knots used in tying flies.

            This book is a true pleasure to read, whether
one's experience with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> is limited to the occasional
accompaniment to chips, to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dover</ENAMEX> sole v√©ronique ,
or to standing hip-deep in an icy stream at
dawn.  It cannot be compared with a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>, per
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">se</ENAMEX>: its headwords serve more as a point of departure
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCully</ENAMEX> to hold forth on the myriad aspects of
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activity‚ÄîI</ENAMEX> hesitate calling fishing a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúsport‚Äù‚Äî</ENAMEX>
which he evidently knows and loves so well.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Australian Underworld</ENAMEX> Slang
            This dictionary combines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> glossaries of underworld
slang which were compiled by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New South Wales</ENAMEX> in the middle of the twentieth
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>.  It is more than a slang <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary:</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simes</ENAMEX>'s own lexicographical analysis of the terms is
detailed and impressive, and he also provides a fifty-two
page essay on the history of the literature and
language of crime and the underworld.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glossary was compiled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hartley</ENAMEX>, who was imprisoned as a conscientious
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">objector</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943 and 1944</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simes</ENAMEX> discovered this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glossary</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">novelist Kylie Tennant</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Library</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tennant</ENAMEX> came into contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hartley</ENAMEX>
through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conscientious Objectors' Union</ENAMEX>, requested
the glossary from him, and used it when
writing her novel <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tell Morning This</ENAMEX> .  Given <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hartley</ENAMEX>'s
stand as a conscientious objector, it is not surprising
that his more expansive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">glosses</ENAMEX> often extend into sociological
commentary.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and longer glossary (containing 726
entries), called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Argot</ENAMEX> , was compiled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX> by
a long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX> known only as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thirty-five</ENAMEX> (from
the custom of referring to a prisoner by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last two</TIMEX>
digits of his official number).  Although the existence
of the glossary was known, especially because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> cites some terms from it in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX> edition
of his The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Austrialian Language</ENAMEX> , most of it has
been unpublished until now.  <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Thirty-five</NUMEX> had been a
school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>, but the reason for his imprisonment
is unknown.  A revised edition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of The Argot
also exists.  The revision includes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> collected
in the period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950-55</TIMEX>, but written up at a later date
after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thirty-five</ENAMEX> was released from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>.  (The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">manuscript</ENAMEX> is dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1975</TIMEX>.)  From his commentary
it is clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thirty-five</ENAMEX>, when compiling
his glossary, had access to a number of books, including
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Partridge</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slang To-day</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> and
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX> edition of The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Language</ENAMEX> .  His
more expansive glosses focus primarily on lexicographical
matters, including some etymological
speculation.  <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Thirty-five</NUMEX> wrote a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Preface to The Argot</ENAMEX>
(included by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simes</ENAMEX> as an appendix), and he
makes some interesting observations about the kind
of material he collected.

            Each entry in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dictionary</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> parts.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is a blend of the headwords
and definitions from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the three manuscripts</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hartley</ENAMEX>'s,
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Thirty-five</NUMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX> compilation, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thirty-five</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">revision</ENAMEX>), indicating by date which manuscript
is being used.  The texts are edited conservatively,
so that spelling or typing errors are allowed to stand.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> part is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simes</ENAMEX>'s lexicographical commentary
on the material provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hartley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thirty-five</ENAMEX>,
often giving information about the origin of the
term, whether it is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX>, whether it is otherwise
unrecorded, and so on.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> consists of
illustrative quotations (where available) from other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">texts</ENAMEX>, mostly from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simes</ENAMEX>'s own files.

            Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> is international underworld
slang: hoist `steal,' beak <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brit</ENAMEX> .  `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magistrate</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX>,' chiseller swindler,' dip `pickpocket,' the rap
the punishment, blame, etc.', screw <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brit</ENAMEX> .  `prison
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guard</ENAMEX>.'  Some of it is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> underworld slang:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fruit</ENAMEX> for the sideboard `easy pickings,' tank a `safe,'
track `prison <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warder</ENAMEX> who carries contraband messages
or goods out of or into a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX>.'
There is much previously unrecorded material: button
up `cease betting, or lower one's stakes considerably
when one is winning'; kipping `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masturbating</ENAMEX>';
sappho term of endearment used between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lesbians</ENAMEX>,
hence derisively addressed to passive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX>.
There are a few remnants of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, as in oofterpa
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poofter</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual</ENAMEX>' and opsca for cops .  At
times, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thirty-five</ENAMEX> offers examples of the extended
use of this slang, as when describing a theft from a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prostitute</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX>:


A smartie will talk his <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> into going to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rubbidy</ENAMEX> and dudding some pervy old mug into
lumbering her.  When they both have the tweeds
down, the smartie will front up, work the mug
over a little for lumbering his missus, and then
shoot through with the bint and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mug</ENAMEX>'s willie.

            

            Some areas of lexical density reflect the social
structure of all-male <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prisons</ENAMEX>: most of the terms for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are pejorative, there are numerous terms for
heterosexual sex, and an abundance of terms for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">penis</ENAMEX>.  In his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Preface</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thirty-five</ENAMEX> argues that the pejorative
attitudes towards <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> derive from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminal</ENAMEX>'s ‚Äúassessment of every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> according to
her eligibility as a mistress‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 222</ENAMEX>), whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hartley</ENAMEX>,
discussing the use of cunt comments: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúProbably</ENAMEX>
this latter expression unconsciously carries with it
the contempt for femininity that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> &
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> and others feel when forcibly shut off from
the other sex.  In this connection it is saddening to
observe the slow but certain deteriation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ] in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>,
some with fine feelings, until their fiancees
are spoken of as chromos and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> as c-nt‚Äù
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 161</ENAMEX>).  There is an obsession with homosexuality:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat `</ENAMEX>passive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual</ENAMEX>,' hock `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX> who is out
to engage in homosexual practices,' honey b-m `passive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">homosexual</ENAMEX>,' whitewash someone's kidneys
`commit pederasty on.'

            The glossaries include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> which is not specific
to the underworld or to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prisons</ENAMEX>.  There are
terms from general <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>: make a balls of `muck
up, bugger up,' bang `intercourse,' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsider</ENAMEX> `horse
(dog) starting at long odds.'  There are general <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian</ENAMEX>
colloquialisms: put the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> on `put the hard
word on,' battler `one who struggles (honestly) for a
living,' bint `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>,' blot `posterior or anus.'  Anyone
who has surveyed the special language of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-group</ENAMEX>
will be aware of the problem of whether one
should include only words specific to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-group</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Thirty-five</NUMEX> obviously feels that these terms which
are not specific to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-group</ENAMEX> have assumed a
special place in the `argot,' or are used intensively in
the underworld or in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hartley</ENAMEX> is also aware of
the issue, and he includes imbecile with the comment:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúA</ENAMEX> common term of contempt in gaol, used
particularly of the warders.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Rhyming</ENAMEX> slang is a feature
of colloquial <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian English</ENAMEX>, but it appears
to have been especially intensive in the underworld
and in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prisons</ENAMEX> at this time.

            A valuable feature of this book is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simes</ENAMEX>'s
lengthy introduction devoted to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúThe Literature</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crime‚Äù</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúThe Language</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lexicography</ENAMEX> of
Crime.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  Simes</ENAMEX> traces crime literature from the first
beggar-books, the German <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Die Betrugnisse der</ENAMEX> Gyler
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c. 1450) and Liber Vagatorum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c. 1510</ENAMEX>), and similar
texts from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>,
through the criminal biography, fictionalized accounts
of crime and the underworld, and finally the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detective</ENAMEX> novel.  An interest in the language and lexicography
begins with the earliest texts, which usually
include glossaries, or explanations of the special
language of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beggars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thieves</ENAMEX>, and so on.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simes</ENAMEX> gives
a full account of these glossaries, and then turns to
the development of dictionaries of underworld slang
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from the 17th century</TIMEX> to the present.  There is detailed
attention to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian</ENAMEX>
material.  This survey and its bibliographical material
will prove an indispensable guide to any lexicographer
interested in underworld <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">slang</ENAMEX>.  The one
omission I note in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autralian</ENAMEX> material is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcus</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúSketches of Melbourne Low Life</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.  The
Language of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bohemia</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which appeared in the Australasian
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1869</TIMEX>.  This article gives a brief history of
underworld slang and an extensive listing of underworld
terms in use in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Melbourne</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1860s</TIMEX>.

            The scholarship that has gone into this book is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exemplary</ENAMEX>, and the book will appeal to the general
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reader</ENAMEX> as much as to the lexicographer.

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of New South Wales</ENAMEX>
            
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Story of Webster's Third</ENAMEX>
            At the time of publication of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s Third
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New International Dictionary</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX>), commonly referred
to as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s Third (but in these pages, for
the sake of brevity, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MW3</ENAMEX> or MWIII ), I was director
of the reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>,
preparing what was later to be published as The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of the English Dictionary</ENAMEX> - Unabridged
Edition .  It was therefore entirely inappropriate
for me to comment on either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWIII</ENAMEX> itself
or the furor raised by its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX>.
More than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three decades later</TIMEX> I readily recall my
opinions about both at the time, opinions that have
changed little over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>: there was no doubt
that the MWIII deserved criticism, but those benighted,
self-appointed guardians of the language
who were heaping vituperative imprecations on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> (and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>) were criticizing it for the
wrong things.

            To be sure, I agreed‚Äîstill agree‚Äîwith those
who believe that the comment about ain't , ‚Äúused
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orally</ENAMEX> in most parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> by many cultivated
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers esp</ENAMEX>. in the phrase ain't I ,‚Äù was not reflective
of the facts: I knew many cultivated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> in
most parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>, and the only time I ever
heard them say ain't was in jocular contexts or in
virtual quotations, like She ain't what she used to be .
I must admit that my evidence was entirely impressionistic,
but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gove</ENAMEX> provided no statistical support
for his contention, either.  My chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criticisms</ENAMEX>, however,
were of a more general nature.  The biggest
was that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gove</ENAMEX> had gone his merry way in producing
what he considered to be a lexicon of the language
but with little thought for those who were to use it:
no one could call the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWIII</ENAMEX> ‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Äúuser-friendly‚Äù</NUMEX> (certainly
not in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX>, when, as far as I know, the expression
had not yet gained currency):

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEADWORDS</ENAMEX>.  The practice of entering proper
names and adjectives with lower-case initials I found
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">off-putting</ENAMEX> because they were normally encountered
with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX>.  To take a random example, there is
some question about the accuracy of description of a
word like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">macedonian</ENAMEX> : it appears in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> main entries,
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of which bear homograph numbers.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, ‚Äúbelonging or relating to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macedonia</ENAMEX>,‚Äù has
‚Äú usu cap ‚Äù as does the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, ‚Äúa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">follower</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bishop Macedonius</ENAMEX> ...,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù</ENAMEX>; but is there substantial
enough evidence for these forms being spelled with
a lower-case m to warrant such treatment?  I doubt
it.  It is far more likely that the preponderance of
evidence would show that an entry with a capital
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M might‚Äîconceivably‚Äîwarrant</ENAMEX> a comment like,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äú</ENAMEX> rarely lower case .‚Äù  Only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> entry, a noun
including the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">senses ‚Äúnative</ENAMEX>[s] or inhabitant[s]; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendant</ENAMEX>;
and language[s],‚Äù shows ‚Äú cap .‚Äù  Where
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gove</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> came up with such highly detailed
information about the distribution of such
forms is hard to imagine.  Certainly, there is no principle
involved in such a distribution.  Of the other
main entries, macedonian cry or macedonian call,
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">macedonian-persian</ENAMEX> , and macedonian pine , each
shows ‚Äú usu cap .‚Äù  As all of these entries are conventionally
capitalized in normal <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, it is difficult to
fathom the rationale for the treatment, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5 CAPITALIZATION</ENAMEX> ,
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explanatory Notes</ENAMEX>, reveals nothing
useful.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRONUNCIATIONS</ENAMEX>.  Another area of confusion for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> is the treatment of pronunciation.  While it
must be acknowledged that pronunciations occupy a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX> deal of space‚Äîowing largely to the dialectal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX> and the precision with which they are represented‚Äîmost
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> are satisfied
to show major (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>) dialect differences and to
rely on detailed variants to be the product of a judiciously
selected key word in the pronunciation key
(a subject I do not have the space to go into here).
But the entry for investiture in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWIII</ENAMEX> shows, for example:

            \-t\?\\?\ch\?\(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">\?\</ENAMEX>)r, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-</ENAMEX>,ch\?\ , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-</ENAMEX>,ch\?\(r), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-t</ENAMEX>\?\\?\t\?\, t\?\\?\ty\?\-\

            [I think that the inferior dash beginning the third
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pronunciation</ENAMEX> must be an error.]  Counting the internal
variations, that is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> merely for
the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> syllables of the word: to see how the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are pronounced, one must go to the preceding
entry, investitive .  It does not get any better, either.
If you want to know how to pronounce homozygote ,
all that is given is

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">\‚Äú+\</ENAMEX>,

            which is not only cryptically unhelpful, but means
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> has to filter back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> columns to see
how homo-words are pronounced, then on to zygote
to see how that is pronounced.  In other manifestations
of this curious, cumbersome style are

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nouak</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chott \</ENAMEX>\?\nw√§k\?\sh√§t, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>\?\w√§-, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-sh\</NUMEX>?\, (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">=\?\</ENAMEX>)=\?\=\

            
               sad.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">du</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ce</ENAMEX>.an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">\|==|</ENAMEX>sƒì\?\n\.

            Such information might be appropriate to a reference
work for phoneticians, dialectologists, and
other linguists, but its usefulness and meaningfulness
in a dictionary for ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionary users</ENAMEX> is
not immediately apparent.

            [Let me clarify what I take to be user-friendly in
a dictionary: most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> pick up a dictionary occasionally
to check a spelling, pronunciation, definition,
etymology, or other information (like usage and synonymy).
For some, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúoccasionally‚Äù</ENAMEX> means several
times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>; for a few, it means several times a week.
One can hardly expect to become steeped in the recondite
style of a dictionary in such brief encounters,
especially since they might well be for entirely different
purposes.  Thus it is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>-unfriendly of a dictionary‚Äîany
reference book, in fact‚Äîto exhibit a style
so involved as to be virtually unassimilable save by a
dedicated, experienced few: except for the arcana,
dictionary style should be revealed transparently to
anyone picking up the book, and no one should be
required to take a course in dictionary navigation or
to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half an hour</TIMEX> adjusting his eyes to read reams
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-point type.]

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEFINITIONS</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most difficult areas to
assess in a dictionary is the quality of its definitions.
Several philosophies of defining prevail‚Äînot too
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abstruse</ENAMEX> to go into in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>, but a not entirely
appropriate aside here‚Äîand the style cleaved to by
Gove attempts an approach that is progressively restrictive
or expansive, depending on the nature of
the word defined.  It works much of the time, particularly
for highly denotative ostensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>; but it
creates ludicrous results when applied to simple
things.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the examples frequently cited of the
worst reflexes of the style can be seen in the main
definition of door :


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> a: a movable piece of firm material or a
structure supported usu. along <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side and
swinging on pivots or hinges, sliding along a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">groove</ENAMEX>, rolling up and down, revolving as one of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> leaves, or folding like an accordion by means
of which an opening may be closed or kept open
for passage in or out of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, or other
covered enclosure or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, airplane, elevator, or
other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>.. b: a similar part by which access
is prevented or allowed to the contents of a repository,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cabinet</ENAMEX>, vault, or refrigeration or combustion
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX>

            

            It is not difficult to understand how such a definition
could be constructed from a collection of citation
slips; what is hard to see is how, once it was written,
someone who had any sensitivity for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> style
and communication could have let it get into print.
Another example occurs at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotel</ENAMEX> :


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> a: a house licensed to provide lodging and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">usu</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meals</ENAMEX>, entertainment, and various personal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> for the public : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INN b</ENAMEX>: a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of
many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> chiefly for overnight accommodation
of transients and several floors served by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">elevators</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">usu</ENAMEX>. with a large open <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>-level lobby
containing easy chairs, with a variety of compartments
for eating, drinking, dancing, exhibitions,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> meetings (as of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesmen</ENAMEX> or convention
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attendants</ENAMEX>), with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> having both inside and
street-side entrances and offering for sale items
(as clothes, gifts, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candy</ENAMEX>, theater tickets, travel
tickets) of particular interest to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>, or providing
personal services (as hairdressing, shoe
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shining</ENAMEX>), and with telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booths</ENAMEX>, writing tables,
and washrooms freely available

            

            One is tempted to comment on further amenities
(e.g., free parking, porters to carry one's luggage,
B-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>, hookers, house <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detectives</ENAMEX>) and on further
restrictions (there are few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> in large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> that
make ‚Äúwashrooms freely available‚Äù even to hotel
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> outside their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, lest some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wretch</ENAMEX> needing
to use the facility wander in off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>); but
would anyone insist that the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> be
restrictively incorporated in the definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> ?;
would a native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> of English refer to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>
and other public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> as ‚Äúcompartments for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eating</ENAMEX>, drinking, dancing,‚Äù etc.?  Indeed, there is no
definition of compartment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWIII</ENAMEX> that fits the
sense to which it is stretched in the definition of
hotel .

            I could go on (and on) with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criticisms</ENAMEX>, but
the purpose of this essay is to review <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Morton</ENAMEX>'s
book, not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWIII</ENAMEX> , regardless of temptation.
In general, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morton</ENAMEX> tells the story of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noah Webster</ENAMEX>
and his legatees in a straightforward, sympathetic,
but not entirely unbiased manner.  To be sure, the
facts are present, awry in only once instance, which
I shall come to later.  In most cases, it would be
difficult, without substantial knowledge, to confute
some of the information presented.  I knew Govenot
well, I hasten to say, but, from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morton</ENAMEX>'s account,
neither did anyone else.  I found him a rather
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dour</ENAMEX>, lugubrious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, and even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s Third finds it difficult to recount many
tales exemplifying his humanity, any a sense of humor.
If sobersidedness make not an attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>,
it certainly need not have affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gove</ENAMEX>'s proficiencies
as a lexicographer.  But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. & C. Merriam</ENAMEX> (as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> was then styled) was not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Gove</ENAMEX>,
and some of the less savory practices of that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesmen</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1950s‚</TIMEX>Äîalways
vigorously denied as company policy by executives‚Äîinevitably
rubbed off on those who one
hopes were innocent of such activities.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morton</ENAMEX>'s history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is probably
reasonably accurate, though one should note that its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> could scarcely be said to be unbiased, most
being company records and either present or former
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.  All the complimentary critiques are well
attended and quoted; the adverse are given equal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, as it were, but not treated with much respect.
As I suggested above, they should not be paid much
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heed</ENAMEX>, being either the result of misconception, ignorance,
lack of understanding, just plain bigotry and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prejudice</ENAMEX>, or‚Äîsurely later on during the dictionary
controversy of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1960s‚</NUMEX>Äîthe mere business of parroting
others' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> -bashing.

            Were I accorded the space allowed the author
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s Third to argue each point with which I
take issue, this would not be a review but another
book, and I have rambled from the main purpose
already.  Yet, there is one bald misstatement of fact
in the book that cannot go unassailed.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morton</ENAMEX>
writes:


Especially noteworthy was the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1972 International</ENAMEX>
Conference on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lexicography</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, a
landmark event that attracted foreign as well as
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>. Organized by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raven I. McDavid, Jr.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Audrey R. Duckert</ENAMEX>, the
conference was held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 5-7, 1972</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>.  The proceedings
were published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Annals of the New York Academy of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sciences 211</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>).  The origins of the conference are described in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDavid</ENAMEX>'s opening remarks.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gove</ENAMEX> did not participate in the planning
or appear on the program, although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> gave
papers, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Woolf</ENAMEX> on defining and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Artin</ENAMEX> on pronunciation. Originally
proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Sledd</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>, the conference
was organized by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raven I. McDavid, Jr.</ENAMEX>

            

            In the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Opening Remarks</ENAMEX> referred to, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raven McDavid</ENAMEX>
did not actually give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sledd</ENAMEX> credit for suggesting the
subject conference but the idea, of another one.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDavid</ENAMEX>'s
further description of the origins of the New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York Academy of Sciences</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYAS</ENAMEX>] conference are a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curate</ENAMEX>'s egg of fact: the facts remain as recorded (I
trust) in the files of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYAS</ENAMEX>, to wit: In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid</TIMEX>
1960s, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYAS</ENAMEX> (and, as far as I
know, the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> associated with the conference
who was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> before, during, and after it), I
approached the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Executive Director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYAS</ENAMEX>, Eunice
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Miner</ENAMEX>, suggesting a conference on lexicography
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  At that time, there was no recognition
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy</ENAMEX> of the existence of
linguistics, which fell somewhere among the various
psychology and sociology stools.  I was turned down,
but not entirely discouraged, and decided to return
to the fray <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years later</TIMEX>, when I had more time.

            I approached the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy</ENAMEX> again after leaving
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>, and, the climate and directorship
having changed, received more encouragement.
Still, it was made clear to me that because I
was not on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of a college or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>, I
should have to find someone who was and who
would support my case.  I got in touch with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. Cassidy</ENAMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Wisconsin</ENAMEX>, now
widely known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Regional English</ENAMEX> , whom I had known in
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1940s</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cassidy</ENAMEX> came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and met
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> (and me).  It subsequently developed
that he was too busy to take on the burdens of the
chairmanship of the conference but suggested <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDavid</ENAMEX>,
whom I knew, as I had engaged him in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1960s</TIMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDavid</ENAMEX> agreed to become involved,
came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, and brought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Audrey Duckert</ENAMEX> (of
Amherst, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>) into the picture as his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX>.

            Thereafter, I worked closely with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYAS</ENAMEX> to
gain the participation of linguists and lexicographers
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and abroad and to further the
purpose of the conference.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">McDavid</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Opening</ENAMEX>
Remarks he refers to some of my (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>) work in
these words:


The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Present-Day English Section</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Language Association</ENAMEX>] then
coopted Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Urdang</ENAMEX>, a professional lexicographer
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">envoy</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Academy of the</ENAMEX>
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>; he had been particularly helpful with
practical suggestions, and in getting financial support
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>....  To ...Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Urdang</ENAMEX> goes
credit for negotiating with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy</ENAMEX>....

            

            Notwithstanding, my claim to prior inspiration remains.
Also, considering that the costs of the conference
were borne almost entirely by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYAS</ENAMEX> (with
contributions from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for Applied Linguistics</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. & C. Merriam Company</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rinehart</ENAMEX> &
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Winston of Canada, Limited</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laurence Urdang Inc.</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman Group Limited</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Foresman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Company</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wm</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collins Sons & Co. Ltd.</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDavid</ENAMEX>'s
casual reference to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy</ENAMEX>'s organizational
and other help, while not atypical, is a bit of a low
blow.

            None of this has much to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> , the book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">or the dictionary</ENAMEX>, and I should say
that anyone who has an interest in the documentation
of such things would be well served to obtain a copy
of it (the book); it is well written and interestingly set
forth.  Considering its subject matter, one should
more surprised at its occasional even-handedness
than shocked at its bias.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Urdang</ENAMEX>
            Organized by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raven I. McDavid, Jr.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Audrey R. Duckert</ENAMEX>, the
conference was held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 5-7, 1972</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>.  The proceedings
were published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Annals of the New York Academy of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sciences 211</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>).  The origins of the conference are described in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDavid</ENAMEX>'s opening remarks.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gove</ENAMEX> did not participate in the planning
or appear on the program, although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> gave

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical</ENAMEX>
Principles
            First, let us look at the statistics (as presented
on the back of the dustjacket of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Shorter</ENAMEX>
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSOED</ENAMEX> ]): 500,000 definitions; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96,600</NUMEX> headwords;
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5 million</NUMEX> words; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,250</NUMEX> variant spellings; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83,000</NUMEX>
illustrative quotations; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7300</TIMEX> sources of quotations
(including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5900</TIMEX> individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>,
among which appears the name of your proud <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> based their counts on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúentries</ENAMEX>,‚Äù a generously defined, arbitrarily artificial
term cooked up between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G. & C. Merriam Company</ENAMEX>
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Treasury Department</ENAMEX> during the
1930s (when that governmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> was responsible
for purchasing, a function now performed
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Services Administration</ENAMEX>).  An entry in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX> commercial dictionary parlance means every
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">headword</ENAMEX> (that is, main entry set flush left, often in
larger boldface type); every <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inflected form</ENAMEX>; every
run-on entry (the self-evident boldface words consisting
of the headword plus a productive ending
like - tion , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">- ly</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">- ness</ENAMEX> , etc.); list words (those beginning
with a common prefix of transparent meaning like

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter -</ENAMEX>, re -, un -, etc., that are merely listed at their
approximate alphabetical place, without definitions
or other lexicographical information); every variant
(counted only once); and every change in a part of
speech.  In a typical college <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">dictionary</ENAMEX>, which might
have, say, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85,000</NUMEX> headwords the entry count (which
is prominently displayed in the jacket blurbs) is
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about twice</NUMEX> that, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170,000</NUMEX>.  In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>
do not generally advertise the number of definitions
in their dictionaries but flaunt their entry counts.  At
a rough guess, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NSOED</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 200,000</NUMEX>
such ‚Äúentries,‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">some twenty per cent</NUMEX> fewer than
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Unabridged</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHDU</ENAMEX> ], the popular
dictionary nearest in size.

            It must be stressed, however, that although the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSOED</ENAMEX> might include fewer headwords‚Äîit has no
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biographical</ENAMEX> and geographical entries, for example‚Äîit
generally accords each entry fuller treatment.
There are, as we shall see, other differences;
but on the most superficial level one might observe
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSOED</ENAMEX> offers more information about
fewer words, which may well prove an enticement
to those who already have a largish dictionary (even
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHDU</ENAMEX> ).

            Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Preface</ENAMEX> describes the content and
provenance of this new edition, it is disappointing
that no statement of purpose, no fundamental linguistic
or lexicographic principle is anywhere set
forth.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reference</ENAMEX> is made to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> , of course, but
the present work could scarcely be said to reflect
the same philosophies.  Notable is the term illustrative ,
used to describe the quotations accompanying
the definitions: aside from their mixed success in
serving to illustrate, quotations served a somewhat
different purpose in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> (and, indeed, in their
application in some other dictionaries): they were
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">source matrix</ENAMEX> from which the definitions were
derived.

            It is worth reminding ourselves that the NSOED
is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionary</ENAMEX>, although that might not be a
particularly intrusive factor in its use, for variant
spellings have been given ample coverage.  But it
does affect the pronunciations, which, given in the
symbols of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Phonetic Alphabet</ENAMEX>, are
(as usual for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> dictionaries) for the prestige dialect
called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Received Pronunciation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> ].  In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX>, Athanasian
is pronounced /a\?\n/, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
would pronounce the final syllable /\?\/;
curiously, that is shown as a variant pronunciation
under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Asiarch</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asiatic</ENAMEX>, and it is hard to
see why it was omitted from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athanasian</ENAMEX> ; perhaps
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSOED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> have the inside skinny (a sense
that is in, along with solid coverage of other neologisms,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slang</ENAMEX> and standard).  It is not made clear why
the standard IPA transcriptions [ai] or [ai] was not
used for the vowel sound in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I</ENAMEX>, why, might , etc.: the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSOED</ENAMEX> shows /\?\/.

            As in other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> dictionaries, headwords are
not syllabified, so one cannot use dictionaries in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX> to determine where a word may be conventionally
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyphenated</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Typesetters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> seem to
know that the words <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eng</ENAMEX>-land and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eng-lish</ENAMEX> are so
hyphenated, a practice that has eluded many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compositors</ENAMEX> and proofreaders, including those
working for some of the ‚Äúbest‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>.  In the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1970s</TIMEX>.  I devised what I thought was a useful
system for showing syllabification of boldface words
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins English Dictionary</ENAMEX>: places where hyphens
could occur were marked by a tiny plus sign
(except for spelling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hyphens</ENAMEX>, which always permitted
end-of-line hyphens); places that marked syllable
breaks but where hyphenation was avoided,
were marked by a centered dot:


pit¬∑y, cit¬∑y, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moth¬∑er</ENAMEX>-in-law, etc.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pho</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ne</NUMEX>+mics, de+ter+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mi</NUMEX>+na+tion, in+ter+cit¬∑y,
etc.

            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionary</ENAMEX>, but, despite the
fact that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compositors</ENAMEX> clambered over one another
to acquire the computerized lists of such
words showing the breaks, others paid the information
little heed‚Äîparticularly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins Publishers‚</ENAMEX>Äî
and the marks were omitted entirely from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second</ENAMEX>
Edition of their dictionary.

            Preferred <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> convention is, naturally,
not reflected in the text of entries: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> spelling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obtains</ENAMEX>.  But the preferred <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> convention of
writing as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words an adverb-adjective combination
when the adverb ends in - ly is also violated:
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> practice calls for widely-spread, closelyrelated
(which appear under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athapaskan</ENAMEX> ), while
standard practice in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> would write these as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
words, hyphenating only modifying adverbs not
ending in - ly : well-known, well-thought-of, easygoing .
(These rules change if the combination appears
in predicative position.)  Elsewhere, Briticisms
might be felt to intrude in definitions, with words
like dustman, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">porter</ENAMEX> , etc., appearing here and
there.  Differences of a more serious nature occur
when definers use words less familiar than the entry
being defined: roasting-jack for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúmechanical spit‚Äù</ENAMEX>;
tenuity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúthinness‚Äù</ENAMEX>; invest for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúaward‚Äù</ENAMEX> are a few
examples.  Not all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> are entered; for example,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">greenkeeper</ENAMEX> is an entry, but greenskeeper , the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> form, is nowhere to be found.  As mentioned,
the pronunciations are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>: the variant
pronunciation of controversy , in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> is
on the (shortened) <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> syllable, is shown, but
that is not heard in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>; neither is the given pronunciation
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intermediary</ENAMEX> , which ends \?\ in
BE but /\?\/ in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX>.  Although there are
r -dropping dialects in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX>, they do not predominate,
as in BE \?\, etc. for card .  The common BE pronunciation
of respite is /\?\resp\?\t/, one not commonly
heard in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE‚</ENAMEX>Äîin fact, one that smacks of a spelling
pronunciation to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>; the pronunciation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/</ENAMEX>\?\resp\?\t/, standard in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX>, is only a variant in BE (but
one I have never heard).

            Emphasis in definitions seems sometimes askew:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interloper</ENAMEX> ... 2 A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who meddles in another's
business (esp. for profit); an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intruder</ENAMEX>.

            

            The problem here is in the use of business : in a definition,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> would expect the literal sense, not the
(more colloquial) sense of `affairs' as met with in
mind your own business, none of your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> , etc.
Yet if one applies that criterion, the definition is too
narrow, particularly with the emphasized mention
of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúprofit‚Äù</ENAMEX>), and it would have been more accurate
to have put the general sense, ‚Äúan intruder,‚Äù <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>.

            It must be noted that definitions are ordered historically
(as the title of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSOED</ENAMEX> implies), not by
frequency.  Thus, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> definition of interlude refers
to a short dramatic piece performed between the
acts of the miracle plays, and the common modern
sense of `interval' is not met with till definition 2.
That is merely a fact‚Äîmany <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> dictionaries
follow the same theme, notably, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWIII</ENAMEX> .

            Were space available, many other strengths and
weaknesses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSOED</ENAMEX> could be enumerated in
detail; but it would be more useful to offer an overall
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX> and to suggest where this dictionary
might fit into a library, personal or institutional.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSOED</ENAMEX> is an impressive, extremely usable dictionary
for those sophisticated enough to know how to
use it, by which I mean not only <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>: those
who have an earlier edition would be well served to
replace it with this one.  Also, the preceding comments
leveled against coverage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American English</ENAMEX>
should in no way affect those who care little about
how <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> use the language, for, in many respects,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSOED</ENAMEX> is simply a superior dictionary.  I
must express a prejudice, however, for the benefit of
all who have a personal computer with a CD-ROM and
who have the wherewithal to acquire the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">OED2e</NUMEX> on
CD-ROM: there is nothing like it in terms of ease of
access, speed, convenience (as compared with hoisting
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more volumes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the OED2e</TIMEX> or NSOED
every time one wants to look something up).  For
casual use, it would be extravagant to go to such an
expense; but for anyone who does even the most
informal research into the lexicon of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, the
CD-ROM version is essential and indispensable: certainly,
no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> in the world has any excuse for not
having it.

            The problems of binding a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3800</TIMEX>-page book are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">formidable</ENAMEX>, but it can be done, and I believe that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OUP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> would have been better served by
being offered a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-volume edition (perhaps with a
needed lectern of its own), enabling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSOED</ENAMEX> to
compete more readily with the other main contenders
among large dictionaries, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWIII</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Unabridged</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swinging</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Swaling</ENAMEX>, Swedging



            In his poem, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Birches</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Frost</ENAMEX> describes a
custom among country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> of climbing birch trees
to the very crown, so high the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> can no longer
support them but bends over submissively and lowers
them to the ground.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frost</ENAMEX> calls this custom
swinging birches , and the one who practises it, a
swinger of birches .  Though the custom was not universal,
back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> still invented
their own entertainments, enough of them
swung the limber birches for it to be a common pastime.
I even have found a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ukrainian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> who remembered
swinging birches.

            But being widespread, the game apparently
earned other names depending on locality.  In the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode Island</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foster</ENAMEX> and Glocester
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Providence County</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other names for the pastime
have surfaced.  Asked if he had ever climbed
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and let them return him to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
Holdsworth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Foster exclaimed</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄúOh, I've swaled
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of `em.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Swaled</ENAMEX>?  Another oldtimer,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Hawkins</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glocester</ENAMEX> likewise speaks of swaling
birches, adding that it did not always work out as
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hoped it would: sometimes the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15-20-foot</NUMEX> gray
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">birch</ENAMEX> would tip part way down only to falter, leaving
the climber dangling halfway, a predicament, indeed.
There is no going back.

            As a noun, swale rolls off the tongues of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">countrymen</ENAMEX>
frequently enough, and means a `tract of wet
ground,' as in the geological term describing rolling
prairies that have swells and swales.  But swale as a
verb harks back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">English</ENAMEX> usage of an early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">OED2e</NUMEX> suggests <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shropshire</ENAMEX> as the source of the
verb, and it cites an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1863</TIMEX> quotation that bears out
our meaning: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúThe great plumed hat flapped and
swaled over my eyes.‚Äù

            As if that were not variation enough, another
Glocester dweller, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Battey</ENAMEX>, refers to this custom
as swedging birches .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swedge</ENAMEX>?  I recognized the
verb swedge as meaning `bend or spread left and
right the teeth of a handsaw that had become too
straight through much use, and hence caused the
saw to bind.'  A tool called a swedge soon remedies
this ailment.  The term swedging a birch thus seems
to have sprung from this bending action.  Such are
the imaginative borrowings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language.
OED2e lists swedge as a variant of swage and suggests
that swage , in turn, is an early form of swag a
`swaying or lurching motion.'  In support, the dictionary
offers this quotation dating circa <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1530</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúthat</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> may not ... disfigure the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Tree</ENAMEX> by swagging
it down with weight.‚Äù

            Do these obscure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">verbs</ENAMEX>, swale, and swedge ,
have a future?  Only time will tell, or only as long as
youngsters swing, swale, or swedge birches.

            I had been cruising the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> for less than an
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX> when I bumped into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger</ENAMEX>.  After exchanging a
few pleasantries, he lowered his voice and asked,
‚ÄúWhat do you think of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX> and I as a potential
twosome?‚Äù

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúThat</ENAMEX>,‚Äù I replied, ‚Äúwould be a mistake.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúFair</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>,‚Äù he agreed.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúAnd</ENAMEX> may the

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúOh.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Roger</ENAMEX> blushed and set down his drink.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúGee</ENAMEX>, I didn't know.‚Äù

            ‚ÄúOf course you didn't,‚Äù I assured him.  ‚ÄúMost
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't.‚Äù

            ‚ÄúI feel very badly about this.‚Äù

            ‚ÄúYou shouldn't say that.  I feel bad ...‚Äù

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúHooray</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger!‚Äù  Martha</ENAMEX> herself wafted towards
us.  ‚ÄúSeeing you, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> gets interesting.‚Äù
She rested a hand on his shoulder.  ‚ÄúWho have
you two been gossiping about, hm?‚Äù

            They were obviously well-matched.

            I excused myself at once, left <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cupid</ENAMEX>'s
hands and went over to check out another participle
I'd noticed dangling by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>.  On my way there,
however, I was charmed by a collective noun (foreign,
I thought) having a singularly bad time in the

            ‚ÄúPardon‚Äîmay I cut in?‚Äù

            Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> looked past tense, indeed, completely
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overwrought</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gratefully</ENAMEX> stood aside.  At
first, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> met my preposition with declension,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúDvandva</ENAMEX>,‚Äù I whispered, knowing that she

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Classic Problem</ENAMEX>



            Typical among the words over which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agonize</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fowler</ENAMEX>-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> dither, and about
which lexicographers write usage notes are the classic/classical
pair.  As in most such cases, the question
is easily answered by looking up the definitions of
the words in a dictionary substantial enough to offer
example contexts.  The problem, as in most usage
matters, is that those who fail to distinguish between
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">classic</ENAMEX> and classical, infer and imply, like and as , etc.,
are blissfully unaware that any question exists: consequently,
not being unsure of anything, they never
bother to check.  One is moved to suggest that it is
the responsibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> to implant
in the subconsciouses of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> a soup√ßon of
suspicion that there might be something questionable
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about</NUMEX> a number of words and constructions in
the language.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX> one despairs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>,
for they, too, seem totally oblivious to style
and traditional practice.  This is borne out by a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>
Times article [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 March 1994</TIMEX>] about a survey
showing that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrants</ENAMEX> to university
were capable of identifying to which part of
speech words in a handful of very simple sentences
belonged.

            The classic/classical distinction has become
manifest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> with the recent establishment of
a new radio station, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Classic FM</ENAMEX>. Radio <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, the longstanding
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> that has broadcast classical music
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>, has not been replaced by this
commercial parvenu, but it should be noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radio</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX> broadcasts classical music, while the new station
is engaged in a different enterprise.  Not only is
Classic music not always classical, but there is an
utter lack of sensitivity in the selection of music
played: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Anitra's Dance</ENAMEX> could well be preceded by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schoenberg</ENAMEX> and followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scarlatti or O Sole Mio</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sung by Tagliavini</ENAMEX>.  <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">One night</TIMEX>, I tuned in and heard
an extraordinarily cacophonous piece that sounded
like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souls groaning</ENAMEX> in hell alternating with dissonant
organ music; as I could not believe what I was hearing,
I continued to listen; I was tortured for about
half <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> but persisted, as I wanted to hear the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title</ENAMEX> in order to make certain that I would switch off
if anyone ever threatened to play it again.  Unfortunately,
I have forgotten the title (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX>), but
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> might recognize it from my reasonably accurate
description.

            Radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> that play classical music might be
criticized for allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telemann</ENAMEX> to be segued by
Tchaikovsky, but that is, surely, a sophisticated criticism.
This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listener</ENAMEX>'s knowledge of and taste in classical
music is not very sophisticated, but the sequences
broadcast by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Classic FM</ENAMEX> serve to demonstrate the
worst features of the differences between classical
and classic .  Yet, perhaps predictably for those who
have a cynical view of public taste, a recent [<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">March</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>] newspaper report reveals that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Classic FM</ENAMEX> has a
regular weekly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> nearly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two million</NUMEX> greater

that all music not classifiable as classical is considered
to be <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jazz</ENAMEX>, requiring a new definition of jazz to
be considered by (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>) lexiographers.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Primrose</ENAMEX> by any Other Name...



            The spring flower we call the primrose ( Primula
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vulgaris</ENAMEX> ) is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> and presumably has had
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX> names as long as the language has been spoken
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Isles</ENAMEX>.  However, primrose is a relatively
recent name for the flower, being first recorded
only in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX>, and no Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
name for it is known.  It is possible that before the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th century</TIMEX> both the primrose and the cowslip
( Primula veris ) were regarded as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and the same
and called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cowslips</ENAMEX> [Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English cuslippe</ENAMEX> ].  Since
where the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> grow near to each other they
hybridize freely giving rise to intermediate forms,
the need for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> names might not have been apparent
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> times.

            The word primrose is often believed to be derived
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> prima rose `<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> rose.' There is,
however, an alternative derivation, since, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, earlier than the first record of primrose , the
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> was known as primerole or saynt peterworte.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primerole</ENAMEX> probably derives from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old French</ENAMEX>
primier `<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>,' with the diminutive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">suffix</ENAMEX> - ole , implying
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">smallness</ENAMEX>.

            The remarkable ability of most species of Primula
to hybridize with ease whenever they meet has
further confused the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> names of the primrose
and its close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hybrid</ENAMEX> between the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primrose</ENAMEX> and the cowslip ( <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Primula</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">veris x vulgaris</ENAMEX> ,
sometimes called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Primula</ENAMEX> variabilis ) is known as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxlip</ENAMEX> .  Usually it is called the common oxlip because
it occurs quite frequently, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purists</ENAMEX> prefer to call it
the false oxlip since there is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, Primula
elatior , now found only in the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX>, which is, for them, the true oxlip .  To add
to the confusion the true oxlip is also known as the
paigle , a name which, in the past, has been rather
indiscriminately applied to several wildflowers including
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">buttercups</ENAMEX>.  In some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country areas</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paigle</ENAMEX> (or pagle , or pagyll ) is still the local name
for the cowslip.  It may be derived from the Old
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> paegle or paegel `winecup.'  This would be
most appropriate, since around the time paigle came
into use cowslip blooms were used to make a very
popular country <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> knew of primroses ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cymbeline</ENAMEX> ),
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cowslips</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Tempest</ENAMEX> ), and oxlips ( The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winter</ENAMEX>'s
Tale ), and presumably the difference between them
although there seems to be no way of knowing
which oxlip he meant.  Wordsworth was, perhaps,
less well informed when in his <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Bell</ENAMEX> he wrote:


A primrose by a river's brim
A yellow primrose was to him,
And it was nothing more.

            

            It might have been a primrose, although they usually
grow in woods and under <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hedges</ENAMEX>.  A cowslip is
rather more likely since they grow in meadows or, of
course, it could have been an oxlip.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Bell</ENAMEX>
should have taken a closer look.
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Endangered English Dictionary: Bodacious</ENAMEX>
Words <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Your Dictionary Forgot</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Grambs</ENAMEX>'s name should be known to word
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">buffs</ENAMEX>, for he has written several books‚Äîthis is his
sixth‚Äîabout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language.  He has been active
in lexicography for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a number of years</TIMEX>, originally
on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The American Heritage Dictionary</ENAMEX> , more recently
on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Random House</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unabridged</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second</ENAMEX>
Edition .

            This book, the title of which suggests that it
might deal with dictionaries, is a dictionary of difficult,
unusual, often obscure, obsolete words, a combination
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poplollies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bellibones</ENAMEX> , by Mrs.
Heifetz, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York Times Everyday Reader's</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Misunderstood ... Words</ENAMEX> , by this reviewer
(recently published in a revised, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> edition
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomsbury</ENAMEX> under the title, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of</ENAMEX>
Difficult Words [plug, in case you missed it]).  Both
kinds of books have been around for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>:
indeed, the latter type preceded general dictionaries
that treat the broad spectrum of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> lexicon,
for it was thought unnecessary to provide definitions
and other information about words familiar
to anyone who spoke <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nowadays</ENAMEX>, of course,
it is felt that a general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionary</ENAMEX> ought to describe
the lexicon of the language (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as far as</NUMEX> space permits),
which is why modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> devote so much
space to entries for words like the<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">, a</ENAMEX>, and, run, jump ,
and play .

            The entries <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">in Endangered</ENAMEX> can be divided
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly</NUMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes: those one knows and those
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> does not.  Among the latter are some engaging
terms that word <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> are likely to add to their writing
(or drop into casual cocktail-party conversations),
and, in some instances, might actually fill a
need.  My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorites</ENAMEX> among these, which are not
found in the present work, are tally and leman ,
which mean a `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> with whom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> cohabits without
benefit of matrimony.'  The struggle that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spawned POSSLQ</ENAMEX>, significant other, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> , and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">miscegenations</ENAMEX> and ennuiisms could have been
avoided by resurrecting these terms, though leman ,
owing to its - <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> ending, might not make it through
the stultifying morass of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s political correctness.

            Many of the rare words in the book are synonyms
that have dropped out of the language for one
reason or another, the main one being that they
were not used.  For many, it might be impossible to
find evidence for their existence outside the single
quotation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> or similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, and they
might have been nonce coinages.  Their rarity is attributable
to what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguists</ENAMEX> refer to as the economy
of language , which is akin to the physical law stating
that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> cannot occupy the same space at
the same time.  Most of the time, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> (or more)
words that appear to be ‚Äúpure‚Äù synonyms semantically
tend to diverge in application or distribution
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">e.g., windpipe/trachea</ENAMEX> ), in frequency (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">niveous/</ENAMEX>
snowy, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lutaceous/muddy</ENAMEX> ), or in connotation ( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">maternal/motherly</ENAMEX> ).
[This matter is discussed at some
length in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Introduction to my Oxford Thesaurus</ENAMEX> .]

            Notwithstanding, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> derive enjoyment
from wallowing in peculiar, curious, and unfamiliar
words, which often provide a source of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">amusement</ENAMEX>.  The selection of such words is likely to
be personal, reflecting the tastes and proclivities of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">compiler</ENAMEX>, hence one is hard put to quarrel with
the choices.  These and other factors are well set
forth by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Preface</ENAMEX>.  It is important to
mention that all words <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">in Endangered</ENAMEX> are pronounced
(using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moo Goo Gai Pan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX>), all are
accorded succinct, clear definitions, and all are provided
with example contexts.

            In the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> pages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Endangered</ENAMEX> an attempt
is made at a reverse dictionary, yielding a
more or less elaborate index to the dictionary section.
Such reverse dictionaries as exist ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernstein</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reverse Dictionary</ENAMEX> having been a popular example
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>) work well for those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> whose
word sense coincides with that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">compiler</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernstein</ENAMEX>'s book never worked well for me, but I
might not be a fair touchstone in such matters.  In
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grambs</ENAMEX>'s book, the single-word synonyms work
fairly well, but, as elsewhere, the system breaks
down when trying to anticipate where a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> ought
to look to find a word: not everyone is likely to
choose the same ‚Äúreverse‚Äù concept.  The problem
has been anticipated by using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> synonym
and by providing entries under both.  For example,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laziness</ENAMEX> or sluggishness : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEGNITY</ENAMEX> appears
both under laziness and sluggishness; thick-lipped:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LABROSE</ENAMEX> appears also under lips, having thick .  Still,
no system could work perfectly for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>.

            Those who enjoy word play‚Äîwhich includes
certain puzzle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">solvers</ENAMEX> who seem to need all the help
they can find that is not already provided by dictionaries,
special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">puzzlers</ENAMEX>' reference books, thesauruses,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">etc.‚Äîshould</ENAMEX> find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Endangered</ENAMEX> a useful, welcome addition
to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>.  Those who simply harbor an
abiding affection for the language and like having
fun with it will want to acquire the book for delectable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">browsing</ENAMEX>.
