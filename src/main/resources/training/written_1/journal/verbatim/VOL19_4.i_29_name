            Despite their reputation for distrusting polyglots,
it is by no means unusual for Englishmen
to be bilingual.  Schoolchildren all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isles</ENAMEX> speak the local dialect at home and in the
playground but switch to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Received English</ENAMEX>--the
language of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> announcers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehall</ENAMEX>, the great
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> and the public school--once the school
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bell</ENAMEX> has sounded.

            Some time ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Trudgill</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lecturer</ENAMEX> in linguistics
at Reading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>, deplored the fact that
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> get the idea that their own language is
incorrect and even inferior, and as a result become
alienated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Three Rs</ENAMEX>.  Though
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">snobs</ENAMEX> and the stuffier sorts of pedagogues are toffee-nosed
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> regional dialects, poets such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> have acclaimed the organic way they have of
fitting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">syllables</ENAMEX>/To the long swell of the land.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> of dialect often single it out as lazy
speech, citing for example the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lancashire</ENAMEX> 'em for
them .  Yet 'em is a far older <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word--derived
from old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>--them them , which is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scandinavian</ENAMEX>
import.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northamptonshire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeremy Seabrook</ENAMEX>
reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Unprivileged</ENAMEX> that his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> would
use terms that appear in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chaucer</ENAMEX> but have long vanished
from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Received English</ENAMEX>. Deploring his lack of
appetite, she would tell him, It's no wonder, with all
them mullocks you've been eating, unselfconciously
employing a word you can find in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A Canon Yeoman</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tal√©.</ENAMEX>  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> will appreciate the irony of
the scornful <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> rejection of I guess, a term that
was good enough for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of The Canterbury
Tales .

            The difficulty of communicating across these regional
and class barriers is considerable.  Received
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is an essential part of the cultural baggage of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornishman</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Highlander</ENAMEX> who refuses to be
confined to some sort of parochialism for life.  Oddly
enough, the more unworldly sorts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX> run
the risk of this self-imposed isolation because their
particular dialect renders them incapable of being
understood outside a very restricted circle.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX>
Edgworth of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">All Souls</ENAMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Graves</ENAMEX>,
tended towards this kind of sesquipedalian speech.
Loitering by the college gates, he once greeted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T.E.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX>, who had just returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> after a
visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>.

            Was it very caliginous in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolis</ENAMEX>?  he
asked.

            Somewhat caliginous, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawerence</ENAMEX> replied gravely,
but not altogether inspissated.

            Toward the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seventies</ENAMEX>, it gradually
became apparent that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britian</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Health Service</ENAMEX>
was suffering from a breakdown in communications.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>,
mainly from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, and the West
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indies</ENAMEX>, who were experiencing difficulties in understanding
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX>.  The problem, however, was
not what one might have expected: the misunderstandings
did not occur because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> was poor.  On the contrary.  They were quite
capable of telling a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, We've carried
out a bronchoscopy, inserted an endotrachial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tube</ENAMEX>, provided assisted ventilation, and positioned a
catheter in his bladder to monitor his urinary output.
What they could not fathom was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
version of the same procedures: We've bronched
him, tubed him, bagged him, and cathed him.  The
confusion was even greater when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant physicians</ENAMEX>
failed to understand the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who attended
their surgeries.  Eventually, the situation was recognized
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministry of Health</ENAMEX> and passing an examination
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>--of a sort--became a condition
of employment.

            Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> boned up on the subject
with the aid of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joy E. Parkinson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manual</ENAMEX> of English
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overseas Doctor</ENAMEX> , a book that enjoyed a brisk
sale <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at the beginning of the 1980s</TIMEX>.  The manual explained
that to understand your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> you must
be able to understand the colloquial and idiomatic
expressions they use and you must be able to speak
to them in a simple way so that they'll understand
you.  The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost</NUMEX> universal ignorance of medical nomenclature
among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> laymen and their dependence
on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">euphemism</ENAMEX> is even the basis of corny old
jokes, like the one about the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biddies</ENAMEX> who
spotted a haulage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> bearing the slogan
We <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Guarantee To Move You, Anytime, Anywhere</ENAMEX>.

            I'll give it a try, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gertie</ENAMEX>, one told her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>.
That <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ex-Lax</ENAMEX> doesn't do me any good at all.

            A few common examples of the sort of misunderstandings
that cropped up repeatedly in the examination
room show how wide the gulf could be
between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and the general practitioner:

            It's me waterworks, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> suffering
from some disorder of the urinary tract would
complain to an uncomprehending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> who
thought he had been mistaken for a plumber.

            I've always had trouble with me tubes could
be especially misleading in the case of a female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>,
for she would almost certainly be referring to
a history of chronic lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and not tubes of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fallopian</ENAMEX> variety.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> would also have to forgive the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subcontinent</ENAMEX>'s
most highly trained cardiologist for failing
to recognize that It's me dickey ticker, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>--which
sounds as if the patient requires the
services of a watch-repairer--is an allusion to longstanding
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> begins to get some idea of the extent of the
problem reading <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson's</ENAMEX> list of just a few of the
colloquial expressions for pregnancy: Away the trip
(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working class</ENAMEX>), to be caught, to be expecting,
to be having a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>, to be in a delicate condition,
to be in an interesting condition, to be in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>, to be in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pod</ENAMEX>, to be in the family way, to be in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pudding</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">club</ENAMEX>, to be preggers, to be so, to be up the pole, to be
up the stick, to catch on, to catch the virus, to fall for
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>, to have a bun in the oven, to have a touch of
the sun.
            

            Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> born and bred in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> are just as guilty as their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> of
spreading these opaque synonyms, abetted in their
case by a fondness for a special kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>-talk that
is supposed to reassure the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>: We're just going
to pop you into the operating theatre and have a
little peep in your tummy.  One particularly outrageous
example of a coy euphemism <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> up in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diane</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The State</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Language</ENAMEX>.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>
gynecologist was explaining her impending hysterectomy
to an understandably concerned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
We're taking out the cradle, he told her, but
we're leaving in the playpen.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sussex Speak</ENAMEX>



            Old Sussex dialect is sadly dying out, save in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">remoter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, where the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>
still speak it naturally.  That is a great pity, as Sussex
rustice were once famous for their amusing knack of
adapting words to suit their own requirements.  For
example, a touch of the old brown crisis would mean
an attack of bronchitis and I mises would be Sussex
shorthand for I surmise or guess.  Typical of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">county</ENAMEX> is still the arbitrary pronounciation of the letters
ee: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> is often pronounced as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> as wick.
            

            The use of the double plural is another old Sussex
feature, as in the verse,

I saw <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ghostesses
Sitting on postesses
Eating their toastesses
And greasing their fistesses
Weren't they beastesses?
            

            Back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1904</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.V. Lucas</ENAMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highways</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Byeways</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sussex</ENAMEX>, noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sussex</ENAMEX> dialect
changed markedly from east to west and that the
demarcation line between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> was the lovely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adur Valley</ENAMEX>--where even the breeds of sheep
changed!  If one hears the old Sussex dialect at all
now it is usually found in the rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hinterland</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">county</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Battle</ENAMEX> (of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1066</TIMEX> fame) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX>-field,
or that fine open stretch of country twixt
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chichester</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midhurst</ENAMEX>.

            The old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">West Sussex</ENAMEX> tendency is to add an extra
syllable to monosyllabic words, so cow becomes
cayoo, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fowl</ENAMEX> is pronounced fewoll.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East</ENAMEX>
Sussex respectively these would be kew and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fewl</ENAMEX>.  The true <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sussexer</ENAMEX> has problems with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">letter h</ENAMEX> , so <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> old traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX> is the Plum
'eavy, the highway is naturally the ighway, etc.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East Sussex th</ENAMEX> is often pronounced as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>, so that
the, them , and that become de, dem, and dat.  Due
to the old Sussex dialect the village <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> could
quickly divide all those they met into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX>: the homelings were the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX> and the comelings
those who had come into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sussex</ENAMEX> from another
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">county</ENAMEX>.

            Frequently heard old expressions include Shennagoo
for shall not go, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drackly</ENAMEX> for straight
away, directly.  High praise is tidy middling and middling
is very fair!  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purdnye</ENAMEX> means almost.  Darngurt
is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sussex</ENAMEX> speak for anything very large, as this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">county</ENAMEX> is naturally given to emphatic statements.  An
overdressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> may be summed up as looks like
a sow saddled and any impossible task calls forth the
comment I can't suck flour and whistle!  Leaves
back'ards up<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">'ards</NUMEX>, it's going to rain was a favorite
saying of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sussex</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shepherds</ENAMEX>.  The cowman
driving his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cows</ENAMEX> up <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Steyning High Street</ENAMEX> would call
Coup, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coup</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coup</ENAMEX>, coom along, as did generations
before him.

            A scolding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> was said to give her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>
a dish of tongues, and the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sussex</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bachelor</ENAMEX> often
gave crisp reasons for staying single: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> went
on record as saying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mesel</ENAMEX>, I ain't no marryin' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>,
fer I can't see naun in givin' 'arf yer grub away ter
get t' other 'arf cooked.  I does me own.

            Counting words in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sussex</ENAMEX> were often used by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agricultural</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> were counted in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pairs</ENAMEX>, thus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX>-erum, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-erum, cockerum, shuerum,
shitherum, shatherum, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wineberry, Wagtail</ENAMEX>,
Tarydiddle, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Den</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>.

            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> have collected gems of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sussex</ENAMEX> dialect
down the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX>  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Parish</ENAMEX> and
another cleric, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Boys Ellman</ENAMEX>, both before
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World War I. Parish</ENAMEX> discovered some amusing
differences, as when a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sussex</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> cries, Oh!  do
adone she means Go on but if she says, Adone
do, she means Stop at once!

            The ladybird was called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bishop Barnaby</ENAMEX> by Sussex
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, as in the old rhyme

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bishop</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bishop Barnaby</ENAMEX>
Tell me when my wedding will be,
If it be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow day</TIMEX>,
Open your wings and fly away.
            

            
               Broom dasher was the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sussex</ENAMEX> description
of a roughly dressed or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly</NUMEX> behaved
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, and someone of low intelligence was described
as chuckle-headed, a term not unfamiliar to
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>.  To be fair clemmed  meant to be very
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hungry</ENAMEX>, cold, or miserable.  A typical county boast
still often expressed is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sussex</ENAMEX> won't be druv and
anyone contrairy is reckoned to be obstinate. Darn
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ma</ENAMEX> wig is a humorous expression of surprise.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frouden</ENAMEX> means to be afraid or to be frit, whilst
feeling ill was once expressed as I be gellish
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ornary</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.  Goistering was a curious term for
loud feminine laughter; a bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> was called
latchety: his excuse might well be, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Laurence</ENAMEX>
has got hold of me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>!

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> and time again the dry <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sussex</ENAMEX> sense of humor
breaks through.  The sadly defunct <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Horsham</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Steyning</ENAMEX> railway line was called the linger and
die.  My obedience was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s reference to her
first-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, and a ditherer was called a mess-pot .
Nineways for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> meant a bewildered expression
and is a good example of the originality of
thought behind many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> sayings.

            The folklore of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> is particularly rich
and this too gives colorful phrases.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX>'s
glory refers to the sweeps of the windmill set in the
sign of a cross, said to bring luck to anyone in the
village getting married.  A shim means a ghost or
just a glimpse of someone.  Pharisees fairies are
also deep in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sussex</ENAMEX> folklore, while something too
complex to understand is called wigwams for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">goose</ENAMEX>'s bridles.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Long Rope Day</ENAMEX> refers to the old
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brighton</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastings</ENAMEX> custom of skipping for luck on
Good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> is the name for the mud
it was thought lucky to bring into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> on one's
feet on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1st</TIMEX>.

            Of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> dialects I suspect that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sussex</ENAMEX> is the richest in its allusions, but I may well
be prejudiced in favor of my beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Downs</ENAMEX>.
To conclude, here is a snippet of the conversation of
an old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">West Wittering</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, who lived near a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>:


such a nice, still <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, only he's always losing
his recollects....  He disremembers everything.
Why <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> he was in a tarrible stodge
cause he mus catch the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> train, an'
prensly there he was back again.  He most-in-ginral
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">goos</ENAMEX> along reading an' a whiffle of wind
blew his book an he disremembered what he'd
gone for!
            
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Language of Past Money</ENAMEX>



            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 15th, 1971</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> introduced
decimal currency.  The familiar pennies, halfpennies,
sixpences, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-crowns, florins, etc., in circulation
were replaced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Pence</ENAMEX>.  Into our language
came a new description, a pee <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pees,
and so on, according to the price charged, for decimal
currency, but out of use went the nicknames and
slang terms used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> for the previous currency.
This had previously happened in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>,
which went over to decimal currency in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jockey Club</ENAMEX> even advised bookmakers
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gamblers</ENAMEX> to avoid using money slang: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">quid</NUMEX>, spin,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brick</ENAMEX>, and pony for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">¬•1, ¬•5, ¬•10, and ¬•25</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">racecourses</ENAMEX>.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> tenner, tanner, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bob</ENAMEX>, oncer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quid</ENAMEX>, and other terms were in common use in conversation
when purchasing an item.  It is interesting
how some of these names and slang money names
arose.

            The name tanner for a sixpence coin was first
used at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the 19th century</TIMEX>.  The reason
is obscure but may come from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gypsy</ENAMEX> word
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tano</ENAMEX> or tawno meaning little, as it was a small coin
compared with others then in circulation.  It may
also be so called for the same reason it was called a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simon</ENAMEX>.  A legandary joke concerns <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Peter's</ENAMEX> banking
transaction when he lodged with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simon</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tanner</ENAMEX>.  Another name for the sixpence was sprat,
which probably came from a cross between this
word and sprazianna, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cockney</ENAMEX> rhyming slang for
a sixpence ( tanner ).

            A <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">shilling</NUMEX> coin was called a bob .  Again no certain
meaning is recorded though it is believed to
have been first used when Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Walpole</ENAMEX> was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>.

            The name of the small silver threepenny coin,
known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">threepenny joey</ENAMEX> or just joey, had the
origin in another small coin, a fourpenny piece or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groat</ENAMEX>.  The latter was issued in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1836</TIMEX> on the advice of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Hume</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Member</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hume</ENAMEX>'s
idea was for a convenient coin to pay for short cab
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journeys</ENAMEX>.  The dissatisfied <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabmen</ENAMEX> did not
like it.  Until then they were usually given a sixpence,
the nearest single coin to the amount of the
fare and few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> hiring the cab bothered to ask
for the change.  When the fourpenny groat was introduced
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> handed that over and the cabbies
were down twopence on each journey, so they
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nicknamed it Joey</ENAMEX> and frequently spat on it in disgust
before pocketing it whenever one was given to them
in payment.  It was last struck for currency use in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1855</TIMEX>.  But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1845</TIMEX> a silver threepence had been reintroduced
and after the disappearance of the fourpenny
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">joey</ENAMEX> , the nickname was transferred to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">threepenny joey</ENAMEX> .

            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-shilling coin was known as a florin,
named after a medieval gold coin from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>.
This was called a florin (from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> fiorino
little flower) because it bore a flower, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lily</ENAMEX>, the
badge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.

            Cockney slang for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-crown coin was tusheroon,
tossaroon, or tosheroon , a corruption of another
slang term for this coin, madza caroon, a corruption
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> mezzo half corona crown.

            The term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea</ENAMEX> , which had a value of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty-one</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shillings</ENAMEX>, arose because the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">guinea</ENAMEX> coins
were minted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1663</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> brought from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guinea</ENAMEX> region of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Africa</ENAMEX>.  But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea</ENAMEX> was
not always valued at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> shillings: from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1663</TIMEX>
it varied from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> shillings to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty shillings</TIMEX>; its
value was not fixed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> shillings till <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1717</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Guineas</ENAMEX>
ceased to be minted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1813</TIMEX>, but continued
until decimal introduction, as a term used in
pricing goods and services.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quid</ENAMEX>, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> and shown
as of obsure origin in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX> ,
means a pound, originally a note, now a coin.
However, it was first used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> as a slang
term for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea</ENAMEX> as long ago as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1688</TIMEX>.  The terms
nicker for a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one-pound</NUMEX> note and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">half a nicker</NUMEX> for a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">shilling</NUMEX> note are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> expressions that
arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, and they were also widely used by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">counterfeiters</ENAMEX> in the underworld.  They also called
their forged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-crowns large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> and forged
shillings small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>.  Half a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> shillings
was first used by gypsies in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>.  The
word <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> for pound might have originated from the
Romany word bauro big and heavy.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cockneys</ENAMEX> also
used to call <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-shilling notes gennets , the origin of
which I have been unable to trace.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sovereign</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea</ENAMEX> coins have been called
bleeders, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jemmy O'Goblins</ENAMEX>, glisteners, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Janes</ENAMEX>, harlequins,
jingleboys, yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>, red <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rogues</ENAMEX>, megs, shiners,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rainbows</ENAMEX> , and thick 'uns.
            

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">racing</ENAMEX> slang a pony is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¬•25</NUMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> ¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">•500</NUMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cow ¬•1000</ENAMEX>, plum <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¬•100,000</NUMEX>, and a marigold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¬•1 million</NUMEX>.
It is probable that pony was used because it is a
small <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>, and racing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gamblers</ENAMEX> thought ¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">•25</NUMEX> was a
small sum with which to bet.

            It should also not be forgotten that in the rural
languages there are also words referring to coins,
money, etc.  In my own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kent</ENAMEX>, Borrow Pence
is an old word for ancient coins, probably those
found in barrows or tumuli, another being Hegs
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pence</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> being <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf's Money</ENAMEX> , though the last
was more frequently used in the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ares</ENAMEX>.  Scimminger
was the name for a counterfeit coin, while
Bargain Pence was earnest money, a low-value coin
given on striking a bargain, making a deal at a market,
or in similar circumstances.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bald Pates</ENAMEX> is almost
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">self-explanatory</ENAMEX>, being a name used in Kent rural
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> for silver <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> coinage ploughed up, found
in barrows, etc., and possibly referring to the poor
design or baldness of the effigy on some of the coins.
         
         
            How to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gain Proverbial Wisdom, or It Takes One to Know One</ENAMEX>



            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proverbs</ENAMEX>, those self-contained nuggets of folk
wisdom, can be addictive.  I know: I once had
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> who had a saying for every occasion.  She
was a short, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plump woman</ENAMEX> with iron-gray hair in a
bun, and she liked nothing better than putting in her
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cents' worth.  She was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dilatory walker</ENAMEX>, with
always the same quip: Slow and steady wins the
race.  Reading that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> was going to
raise taxes, she thumped the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> and intoned,
You can't squeeze <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> from a turnip.  If
ever asked to explain one of her rare periods of
quiet, she would reply, Still waters run deep.

            My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX>'s visits were infrequent during my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">childhood</ENAMEX>, and it was only after her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> died
and I was in high school that she began seeing my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> on a regular basis.  I tolerated my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> and
her proverbial wisdom until she began applying it to
her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX>.  Hearing that I regularly went to sleep
after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX>, she lectured me: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Early</ENAMEX> to bed and
early to rise makes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> healthy, wealthy, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wise</ENAMEX>.  When I took a trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlantic City</ENAMEX> and gambled
away the amount I had intended, she warned,
A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool</ENAMEX> and his money are soon parted.  She even
found fault with my studious habits: All work and
no play makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX> a dull <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>.

            It is hard to counter a proverb: they have all the
plodding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of a mule-driving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasant</ENAMEX>, earthy and
inevitable.  So when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> related gospel like
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood</ENAMEX> is thicker than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, I could think of no
answer but a sullen nod.  That is, until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> when
I was helping my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> fix dinner for a family occasion
and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> came into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>.  She asked
how she could help, and when I protested that we
had everything under control, she placed her hands
on her hips and told me, Many hands make light
work.

            Too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cooks</ENAMEX> spoil the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">broth</ENAMEX>, I murmured.
My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> opened her mouth to reply, but nothing
came out.  It was a momentous occasion.  Several
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks later</TIMEX>, I was complaining about having to buy a
new suit, and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> happened to be within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earshot</TIMEX>.

            Clothes make the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, she informed me.  I
considered her point.

            You can't judge a book by its cover, I replied.
So much for the wisdom of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ages</TIMEX>.  After that,
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> was a lot more careful what she said around
me, like a burnt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> that shuns the fire.  But eventually
she reverted to her old proverbial ways.  On
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> occasion, I had spent half my allowance on an
expensive pair of sneakers, and when she told me I
should have bought a cheaper brand, I simply betmoaned
my small stipend and wondered if I would
ever amass any significant sum of money.

            That was her cue.  She wagged her finger at me.

            Let me tell you something, young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.  Take
care of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pence</NUMEX>, and the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">pounds</NUMEX> will take care of
themselves.

            Oh?  I admit I was semi-prepared for this.  I
had checked out a collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proverbs</ENAMEX> from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> and was becoming rather well-versed in
them.

            What about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penny-wise</ENAMEX>, pound-foolish?

            My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> thought about this for a moment.

            I think, she said finally, you are being deliberately
provoking.

            I weighed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> of this remark, but could
not be bothered to adjust the scales.  If my proverbial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aunt</ENAMEX> was going to advise me, I was bound to
devise some counter-stratagem.  Luckily, the world
of proverbs, sayings, adages, maxims, and plain old
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saws</ENAMEX> is various enough to say anything you want.
Since they are meant to cover all of life's vicissitudes
from cradle to grave, they are bound to collide at
times, sometimes obliquely, sometimes head-on.  I
pressed this knowledge to my advantage.  My next
opportunity came soon enough.  I was complaining
that I could not find a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX>.  (I complained a lot
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX>, a habit many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proverbs</ENAMEX> warn against.)
Apparently, I protested loudly enough for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX>
to take note because she tried to console and scold
me in that double tone that proverbs have.  She put
her hand on my shoulder.

            Don't fret so much, she said.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>'s best
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend</ENAMEX> is his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>'s best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> is his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>, I retorted, but
I can't see myself asking <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Jessie</ENAMEX> out on a date, can
you?

            My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> just shook her head and sighed.  A year
later, after I actually had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> and was worried
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about summer vacation</TIMEX> when she would be
away, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> passed on this pearl of wisdom: Absence
makes the heart grow fonder.

            I was growing more educated and this time
quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> back.  Out of sight, out of
mind.  (Unfortunately for my love-life, my proverb
turned out to be the right one.)

            My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> gave an annoyed tsk.  I give up on
you, she said, and left the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>.

            Of course, she never quite conceded defeat:
hope springs eternal in the human breast.  She continued
to quote at me, and I requoted back.  But as
she got older, her steel-trap memory turned into a
steel sieve, and she became almost touchingly uncertain
of her words.  I recall to my credit that, when
she was despairing of ever doing anything more with
her life and muttered, You can't teach an old dog
new tricks, I cheered her up by flatly opposing her:
It's never too late to learn.  She died in her eighty-third
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, and though only her name and dates
adorn her headstone, I often think of inscribing an
addendum: A little advice goes a long way.

            My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> did not leave behind much in the way
of possessions.  What I am left with is a list of proverbs
for all occasions, which I hereby bequeath to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> along with my own contradictions:

suit different occasions.  Literature, which is now

For instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polonius</ENAMEX>' spate of proverbial advice

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nowadays</ENAMEX>, I feel an odd kinship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polonius</ENAMEX>.  In
fact, I have felt lately as if I were employing more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proverbs</ENAMEX> in my own speech, maybe turning into my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX>--like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX>.  This would be a fine
turnaround for someone whose first interest in language
was as a proverb-basher.  Somewhere in the
background I can hear my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX>'s reaction to this
confession.  Or as she might put it: She who laughs

            In semantic terms, the words in the above title
belong to a specific domain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> vocabulary
with which every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the human race
achieves intimate familiarity.  The naked terms for
such a traditionally taboo subject as the toilet
have always proved too much to bear for polite society,
which hastily covered the bare-cheeked shame
of them with a blanket of euphemism.  The domain is
a prolific nursery of such <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">linguistic fig</ENAMEX>-leaves, and as
a result (contrary thing that human nature is) has
also fostered many ribald versions.  It is not surprising,
therefore, that there is an almost inexhaustible
supply of paraphrases and synonymous terms in this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>, ranging from the most tasteful euphemism to
the most flagrant vulgarity.  While most of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bear</ENAMEX> testament to the wonderful versatility of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English language</ENAMEX> and the rich vein of humor that
runs through our culture, some necessitate etymological
investigation in order to uncover their roots
and, in some cases, to explore changes in meaning.
Most, indeed, defy precision in the attempt altogether.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six hundred years ago</TIMEX>, toilet designs, though
crude, were what we might term <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> latrines (the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Middle English</ENAMEX> word was laterin from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> latrina):
planks of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> with circles cut into them, placed
over a ditch.  Conveniences for the wealthier sections
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> (i.e., those who could afford
high-rise property) consisted of straight-drop or
long-drop privies.  The word privy is one of the earliest
euphemisms used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>; an anonymous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the fifteenth century</TIMEX> advised
whanne he sitteth at privy he schal not streyne
him-silf to harde.  It is derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
word priv√© and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> privatus , both meaning
private, and this is the specific sense in which the
word entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language.  The earliest euphemisms
documented use of the word in this original
sense of intimacy or familiarity between people
dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1225</TIMEX>, and privy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX> (a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monarch</ENAMEX>) from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1300</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edward I</ENAMEX>
established it.  It is not surprising, semantically
speaking, that the word widened its meaning so
quickly since it naturally lent itself (as did closet ) to
the description of a solitary place, one where people
performed lavatorial functions.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Privy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">closet</ENAMEX> are examples of euphemism by
metonymy, which is the substitution of the name of
an attribute of a thing for the thing itself: a toilet is a
private place, therefore a privy.  Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bombay</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">furniture</ENAMEX> (a style combining <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> forms with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ornamentation</ENAMEX>) provided the metonymic euphemism
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bombay</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX>
tells us that the name is possibly attributable to the
Bombay chair , wherein chamberpots were placed, as
it was common in the past to have one's chamberpot
concealed in a piece of furniture, which could then
be proudly displayed.  The name close-stool , which
makes an appearance in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">All's Well That</ENAMEX>
Ends Well of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1606</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Florio</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montaigne</ENAMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1603</TIMEX>, was also inspired by the furniture in which it
was cased, as was commode .

            If one is to go by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX>'s use of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">close</NUMEX>-stool, it
seems interchangeable with another, less notorious,
term for a privy, the ajax.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixteenth century</TIMEX>,
an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Elizabethan</ENAMEX> courtier, Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Harrington</ENAMEX>, invented
a water-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">closet</ENAMEX> with a flushing system and
wrote a book on the subject entitled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Metamorphosis</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ajax</ENAMEX>, published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1596</TIMEX>.  The word, however,
seems to have existed before that, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>
uses it, also in close conjunction with close-stool, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Love's Labour's Lost</ENAMEX> , c. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1593</TIMEX>, and it achieved an entry
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cotgrave</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionarie</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
Tongues of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1611</TIMEX>.  Its exact origin is unascertained,
but it is likely to have been a variant of jakes
(with the indefinite article preceding it).  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jakes</ENAMEX> is
also of unknown origin; the most common suggestion
for its roots is in the proper name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX> , which is not unbelievable when we consider
other examples such as <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">jerry</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">john</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>
uses jakes confidently in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Lear</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c. 1605</ENAMEX>):

My lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread
this unbolted villain into mortar, and daub the
wall of a jakes with him.

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Partridge</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, suggested that the word dates
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1530</TIMEX> and was standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1750</TIMEX>, when it became a colloquial term.  The word
was also very much alive in the late nineteenth and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early twentieth centuries</TIMEX> in the dialect of southwestern
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX>, where it had come to mean any type of
filth or litter, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elworthy</ENAMEX>'s A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Somerset</ENAMEX>
Word<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">-Book</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patridge</ENAMEX> also says that the term is
now obsolete, but to this day the blocks of toilets at
my old school, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hertfordshire</ENAMEX>,
are affectionately known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jakes Tower</ENAMEX>.

            The origin of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">jerry</ENAMEX> , like so many of these terms,
can only be guessed at.  It is slang for chamberpot
and, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">jakes</ENAMEX> , could be the familiar variant of a
proper name ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeremiah or Jeremy</ENAMEX> ).  It is supposed,
however, that it is an abbreviation for jeroboam,
which started off life as a large bowl for holding
wine [<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I Kings xi</ENAMEX>. 28/xiv. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>]; the addition of the suffixes
-y, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-ie</ENAMEX>, and -ey to the main stem of a word have
always been popular ways of forming diminutives.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appeared in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hotten</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Slang</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1859</TIMEX>, defined as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber utensil</ENAMEX>.  In An Etymological
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Modern English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Weekly</TIMEX> suggested an even earlier association with
the word jordan, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">medieval alchemist</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> and,
later, a chamberpot.  All these are feasible surmises
by the process of metonymy.  Perhaps it hails from a
shortening of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">jerry</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c. 1851</ENAMEX>), a term used to
describe a low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>.  As the chamberpot is a
great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> to those with bibulous tendencies, jerry
might have become a pet-name for it.

            The etymology of the word loo is perhaps the
greatest mystery of all in this field of vocabulary.
The word first gained general usage in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> during
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, and possibly came about as a result
of fraternizing with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>, perhaps as a
corruption of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l'eau</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>) or lieux <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">d'aisance</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water</ENAMEX>-closet),
or even as a derivation of the cry ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garde</ENAMEX> √°
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">l'eau</ENAMEX>! , given to warn passerby that someone above
was about to slop out (the anglicised form, gardyloo
! , occurs in this context in a novel by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tobias Smollett</ENAMEX>
as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early as 1771</TIMEX>).  Also at that time, rustic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> used to have the number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> painted on
their privy-doors; to go <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al</ENAMEX> numero cento was an accepted
idiom of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>: indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> used to
have fun replacing the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> after the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">privy</ENAMEX> had been used.  The number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> is not dissimilar
in appearance to the word loo , and there were
plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servicemen</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.A.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1943</TIMEX> onwards.

            Among the more incredible explanations (as recorded
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adrian Room</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Dictionary of True Etymologies</ENAMEX>)
are a derivation from ablution or luliana
[ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily Telegraph</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 September 1968</TIMEX>] and even from
hallelujah, as prompted by a caption to a cartoon by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Maurier</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Punch</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 June 1895</TIMEX>], which read
Now we'll begin again at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hallelujah</ENAMEX>, and please
linger longer on the lu!  A more promising story to
note is that of a corruption of the word lee: for those
working in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, a place for relieving oneself
was always chosen out of the bite of the wind, that
is, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lee</ENAMEX>.

            Terms such as toilet and lavatory have, like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">privy</ENAMEX> , undergone pejoration over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> (that is,
their meanings have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired depreciatory connotations</ENAMEX>).
The original meaning of lavatory was simply
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> for washing: in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1382</TIMEX> translation of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bible</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Wycliffe</ENAMEX> talks of washing feet in a
brasun lavatorie [<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Exodus</ENAMEX> xxx<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18</NUMEX>].  Similarly, to perform
one's toilet in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1681</TIMEX> was the action or process
of dressing or of washing and grooming [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX>] .
An unclear sense-development of this word is
mapped out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> , but it seems to concede
that the modern sense of lavatory originated at the
start of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX>: the (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Stores</ENAMEX> catalogue of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</TIMEX> lists a lavatory paper-holder
as one of its items, but it was probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>: The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illustrated London News</ENAMEX> reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1860</TIMEX> that each
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ward</ENAMEX> of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florence Nightingale School of</ENAMEX>
Nursing had its own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX>, lavatories and
closet.  While toilet and lavatory have discarded
their original meanings, terms such as bog retained
their original meanings (a marshy place) as well as
being understood in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> as a slang synonym for
a toilet; it achieved an entry in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hotten</ENAMEX>'s dictionary
as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early as 1864</TIMEX> as a privy as distinguished from a
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">closet</ENAMEX>.

            Terms which border on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vulgar</ENAMEX> tend to be onomatopoeic:
examples include chuggie, duffs, dubs,
biffy, honk , and thunderbox .  The last example (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Partridge</ENAMEX> tells us) is a nickname for a chamberpot
originating in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> c. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1870</TIMEX>, and is derived from the
noise therein caused].  By far the most numerous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of terms is that which contains words only with
a localized meaning.  It would be impossible to compile
a definitive glossary for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, but a few
examples follow: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> (naval <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">colloquialism</ENAMEX>, dating
from the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteenth century</TIMEX>, said to be from
the location of the latrines on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>); the longs (pet-name
for latrines at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brasenose College</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>, from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1870</TIMEX>, so-called because they were built from funds
donated by a certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady Long</ENAMEX>); and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">greenhouses</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ulysses , Book VIII</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Joyce</ENAMEX>'s personal slang for
the public toilets after the color of their paint.  It is
this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that ensures steady growth in this most
malleable domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vocabulary</ENAMEX>, for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> of the human imagination are limitless.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windy English</ENAMEX>



            For the best part of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX> I have lived on
and off in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Windward Island</ENAMEX> of the now
largely ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>.  The semantic of these
former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crown Colonies</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> and anarchic,
bearing in mind that academically, if no longer psychologically,
they remain anglophone.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Schoolchildren</ENAMEX>
are guided into, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> and, then, A
Levels, corresponding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School and Higher</ENAMEX>
Certificates of my own <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> youth; these are set
from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> and incline, to my mind, to an all
too often condescending leaning to local idiom-worship,
from which most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">BeeWees</ENAMEX> want to free
themselves.  Northwards, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leeward Island</ENAMEX> moving
up through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antigua</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jamaica</ENAMEX> are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> locked
into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> television, while southwards the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of the</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Indies</ENAMEX> duplicates any run-of-the-mill <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX>, at least in its language aspects,
being blessedly innocent of any courses in Anglo-Saxon
or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle English</ENAMEX>.

            The small pocket of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Windward Island</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">semantic</ENAMEX>,
if such it can be called, has nothing to do with the
patois of adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> islands.  Obviously the
short-lived <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> conquests in the region left behind
words and names; here a crazy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is foo [for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fr</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fou</ENAMEX> ] or, if you want to insult him, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crapaud toad</ENAMEX>,
while on our little island resolutely <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> placenames
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grenville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX>) nestle beside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> like
Perd-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mon</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Temps</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Tante, Crochu</ENAMEX>.  The fact remains
that no bush local understands <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> or
wants to.  I am roughly familiar with researches into
this semantic by old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Groome</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grenada or Frank Collymore</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barbados</ENAMEX>, but find
use of the living language hereabouts best shown in
the work of the late and much lamented Shiva
Naipaul, younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V.S.</ENAMEX> (who declines to
use his knighthood).  Set in the fictional Cuyama
(clearly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guyana</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shiva</ENAMEX>'s A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hot Country</ENAMEX> is a West
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> masterpiece, even though islands characterize
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guyana</ENAMEX> (formerly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BG</ENAMEX>, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Guyana</ENAMEX>) is mainland.  Far from inclining to
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives cleave</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> schoolboy
slang, a hard-dying lingo.

            Take nicknames.  Nearly everyone I know has
(=does have) a nickname in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windwards</ENAMEX>, where
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Son Mitchell</ENAMEX>
(evidently the first-born of an inside marriage),
while my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builder</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonny</ENAMEX>, not an easy name for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal</ENAMEX> to summon him by.  Still more difficult
to use with the confidence of a local is my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardener</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sobriquet</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Black Man</ENAMEX>. A career in an
ultra-liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> inhibits my calling
out, even in the friendliest manner, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Come</ENAMEX>,
Black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Man</ENAMEX>.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Too</ENAMEX>, our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> refer unashamedly to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nigger</ENAMEX> hair which, to date, I cannot.)  So most nicknames
are the inheritance of boyhood features or
facial characteristics, e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chubby, Porgie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Snail</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Speedy</ENAMEX> (apparently his opposite), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peg-Leg</ENAMEX>, and
the like, all delineating good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of mine.  Rastas
have their own system.

            There is little linguistic ruling available here,
however attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">BeeWee</ENAMEX> speech rhythms may
sound to the casual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourist</ENAMEX>.  There is no authentic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dialect</ENAMEX> in the ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, not even in the
sense of a pejorative corruption of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> tongue
(as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, for instance).  It is simply
sentimental to propose the contrary, as do the sophisticated
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> of multiculturalism, like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Lamming</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barbados</ENAMEX>.  What mostly characterizes
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Windward Island</ENAMEX> speech could be called a
kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linguistic laziness</ENAMEX>, and this has considerable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">charm</ENAMEX>, as a lot of laziness can.  A typical morsel of
such speech plucked from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shiva Naipaul</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Chip-Chip</ENAMEX>
Gatherers: I tired hear you say that.  The
meaning is perfectly clear.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> is simply
abbreviating from I am tired of hearing you say
that, and expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>) by doing
so.  This is not to deny that there is an ingrained
poetic in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BeeWee</ENAMEX>--I have been offered  a smile of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">whiskey</ENAMEX> (who could refuse?), directed to a beach
where the water he weep over the rock , and told I
feels a little bit much more better, thanks.  The last is
the typical local double (or triple) comparative, but
it does not establish a linguistic.

            Take the idiosyncrasy in the use of personal pronouns,
that of the lack of, or reluctance to use, accusative
and dative cases or even the possessive.  Why
bother?  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> form can do the job.  We will do just as
well for us or ours .  Thus a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Windward Island</ENAMEX> might
say, They take we jobs from we. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grenada</ENAMEX> of the
revolutionary <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979-83</TIMEX> interregnum, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prime Minister</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Bishop</ENAMEX> was We <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leader</ENAMEX>. Or, from Shiva
again: The moment we get we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> off we hands
we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leavin</ENAMEX>' here.  They does bramble we.

            None of these rather charming locutions is represented
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthographically</ENAMEX> (in government documents
and the like), yet one prevalent curiosity has
always struck me, namely the dropping of the final g
from participles.  Sitting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brimmin</ENAMEX>' up a smile of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">white</ENAMEX> (perhaps even a grin of such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX>) over a seascape
of beauty, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Windward Islander</ENAMEX> told me, ‚ÄúI
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viewin'</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duplicates</ENAMEX> precisely the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">huntin</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shootin</ENAMEX>'
-fishin' locution of my <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> youth, and
could be another reason for calling <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">West Indians</ENAMEX> the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Englishmen</TIMEX> left around.

            Nevertheless, some elements of Windward
speech can be regularized into a sort of grammar,
particularly in verb tenses. The constantly surprising
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ubiquity</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, dockyards, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garages</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> may account for
what seem to visitors to be odd usages, variations
often coming over at first as error; the universal use
of the conditional would for the future will can lead
to serious confusion, e.g., in legal documents.  A
comparison of the present tenses of the verb to have
and to be yields the following reversals:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STANDARD     BEEWEE</ENAMEX>
I have       I has
he/she has   he/she have
we have      we has
you have     you has
they have    they has

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STANDARD    BEEWEE</ENAMEX>
I am        I is
he/she is   he/she are/am
we are      we is
you are     you is
they are    they is

            

            Of course, these variants are regarded as errors
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiners</ENAMEX>, but it will be a sad day
when they are expunged from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Indian</ENAMEX>
scene, since they make a response to shades of reality
unavailable in middle-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic BBC</ENAMEX>.  So do,
surely, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BeeWee</ENAMEX> intensifications, doubling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the epithet</TIMEX>;
a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Windward Islander</ENAMEX> may call a fruit sweet-sweet ,
one adjective not sufficing to express feelings
about it enough. Sweet-sweet is much more sweeter
than very sweet, is it not?

            Television has recently begun to inundate these
incompetent but lovable little islands, embarrassing
colonial deposits <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> handed over to sink or swim in
independence.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> are already busy
ironing out indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> rhythms in the
interests of the global village.  In an article (The
Use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lallans for Prose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Journal</ENAMEX> of English
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Germanic Philology</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LI</ENAMEX>, No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April, 1952</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pp</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">212-225</ENAMEX>), I tried to show, elsewhere, this happening
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braid Scots</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doric</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lallans</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>.  But in that case a linguistic amalgam cohered
early and was only pushed back northwards
after having established a local literature (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunbar</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henryson</ENAMEX>).  Nor did it have to fight television.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Alas,</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windward Island English</ENAMEX> is far more vulnerable to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standardization</ENAMEX>.

            Maybe I'm a dullard, but... the letter-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> began, then with nimble argument
demonstrated that he was anything but.  I was induced
to read his piece, however, not so much by
the trusty rhetorical device of self-deprecation as by
that fusty word dullard .  It seemed to wear a thin,
fuzzy coat of mildew, as if summoned for this rare
duty from a cobwebbed trunk in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">attic</ENAMEX> of obsolescence.

            It got me thinking about other words that end in
-ard , a process that inevitably involved <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of dictionary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">delving</ENAMEX>.  Unaided, I could conjure up only
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>, not counting backguard and blow-hard which,
while conforming to the pejorative pattern of the
-ard words, were not formed as the others by the
simple suffix addition.  My list, after dullard ,
counted dotard, bastard, buzzard, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coward</ENAMEX>, dastard,
drunkard, laggard, lollard, niggard and wizard .  Of
those, only the last would be taken <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> with equanimity,
although wizard was not always complimentary.
The delightful and certainly disparaging canard
also occurred to me, but I had already decided
to limit my quest to personal epithets.

            And what a rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lode</ENAMEX> of dormant invective I
tapped!  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The OED2e</TIMEX> lists about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five dozen</NUMEX> -ard
words to describe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of unsavory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> or
underdeveloped intellect, and all but the handful
above now languish in dusty disuse.  Virtually all of
them are derogatory, and some of them are so mordantly
mean that I can only lament their loss--perhaps
to a precursor wave of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s political correctitude?
The next question was this: What was it
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about the</NUMEX> -ard ending that appealed to our badmouthing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forebears</ENAMEX>?

            Some time between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 8th and 12th centuries</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> began honoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> and other
eminences by adding -hard to their names,
to denote hardy.  The practice carried over into
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle High German</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, where it developed
a sarcastic edge and became generally derisive.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> adopted the habit as an intensifier of
musculine nouns, proper and improper, and this too
became mostly pejorative, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mouchard</ENAMEX> sneak or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">informer</ENAMEX> (from mouche fly), and froussard coward
(from frousse fright), and bastard , a trenchant
abbreviation of fils de bast <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pack-saddle child</ENAMEX>.  The
practice jumped the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Channel</ENAMEX>, as did many things
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Conquest</ENAMEX>.  At first the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> were content with unalloyed borrowings,
but then began tacking the invidious -ard onto
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">purely English</ENAMEX> words, producing the likes of drunkard,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">laggard</ENAMEX> , and sluggard .

            Before long, there were many, both imported
and home-grown.  They fell into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main categories:
words for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fools</ENAMEX>, idlers, and wastrels; for people
with other undesirable or downright anti-social attributes;
and for those with some physical disability.

            In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> category were babelard or babillard
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">babbler</TIMEX>; lubbard for big, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stupid lout</ENAMEX> (from
which came landlubber); <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">caynard lazy dog</ENAMEX> (ultimately
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> cagna bitch); losard rake
or profligate (from Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> losel one who is
lost to perdition); and the mellifluous but contumelious
musard , whose sin was day-dreaming.

            Even more to be censured were the peevish and
fretful fretchards, the penny-pinching misards and
muglards, the parasitic, hypocritical sycophants
known as papelards (after <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> pappalardo one
who eats <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacon fat</ENAMEX>), the pilfering pillards , the pusillanimous
snivelards , the deceitful trichards , and the
loathsome loners called unkards .

            More persecuted than censured were citizens
who fell short of contemporary standards of physical
perfection.  They included the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sparsely coifed ballard</ENAMEX> ,
the squinting, weak-eyed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">blincard</TIMEX> (who could
also be one who deliberately ignored reality), the
hobbling mendicant limpard or clochard (from
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> clocher to limp), the stammering mafflard ,
and the scallards and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scabbards</ENAMEX> who suffered from
some skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.

            A sub-species of -ard word, if not of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>,
might be labeled political.  In this charming group
we find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynamitard</ENAMEX>, an explosive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> radical leftist; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dreyfusard</ENAMEX>, erstwhile
bleeding-heart supporter of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Capt.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Dreyfus</ENAMEX>,
wrongly convicted of treason in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1894</TIMEX> and exonerated
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1906</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cagoulard</ENAMEX> (from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> wearer of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">monk</ENAMEX>'s cowl), a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a sort of 1930s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ku Klux Klan</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Communard</ENAMEX>, an adherent of the
Commune of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that took over the municipal
government of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> capital and played
a leading role in the post-revolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reign</ENAMEX> of Terror.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of a rebellious <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faction</ENAMEX> were called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Guisards</ENAMEX> because of their extravagant
get-ups; the word has become a common, if
rarely used, noun for a masquerader or mummer.

            This by no means exhausts the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> of sleeping
slurs that once formed an 'ard core of popular insult.
I could go on, but given the space constrictions, that
would be foolardy.
         
         

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brewer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twentieth Century Phrase</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fable</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>] can only be referred to as
white if it is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lippizaner</ENAMEX>.  Otherwise, snowiness
notwithstanding, it is grey.



         
         

            The discussion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spoonerisms</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPISTOLAE</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIX</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 17</ENAMEX>] should, I feel, not be closed without mentioning
at least a few more of the classic examples of
the genre.  Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spooner</ENAMEX> himself is supposed to
have referred to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> as a muddy bleak
place.  When the first motorized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> appeared
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> he opined that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Automobiles</ENAMEX> are all
very well, but for pure pleasure give me a well-boiled
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">icicle</ENAMEX>.  In my own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> Spoonerisms flourished
luxuriantly for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>, and we hardly
spoke of the weather, for instance, without invoking
their oblique charm: It's rotting with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, or
perhaps more frequently (it was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> Midlands,
which as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilaire Belloc</ENAMEX> said are sodden and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unkind</ENAMEX>): It's roaring with pain.  Some of our visitors
must have been rather put off when my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six-year-old</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> announced to them before dinner:
We're going to have parrots and keys.  But even
further back, in my own schooldays, the Spoonerism
celebrated many triumphs.  We would ask each
other, for instance, what was the difference between
a bon mot and a fart.  The answer was that the bon
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mot</ENAMEX> is a shaft of wit.  While on this subject, I may as
well quote another of these prize questions: What is
the difference between a warhorse and a carthorse?
The answer is, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spooner</ENAMEX>'s eternal glory, that the
warhorse <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">darts</ENAMEX> into the fray.



         
         

            I learned in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Botswana</ENAMEX> that plonk means purple
liquid, origin not known. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STP</ENAMEX> is a step lower:
screw-top plonk.  These definitions might have
emerged from extensive trials.



         
         
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South African English</ENAMEX>,
            The appearance of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> edition of this dictionary
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOSAE</ENAMEX>] within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirteen years</TIMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is
an indication of its popularity as well as of its scholarly
significance.  The current edition was partly
motivated by the recent political changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX>, which resulted in the unbanning of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, and books.  For the lexicographer
this opened up the possibility of new words (e.g.,
the last apartheid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.W. Botha</ENAMEX> had officially
outlawed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> and white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minority</ENAMEX> rule) and,
more important, of new citations.

            Of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is a significant
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> is perhaps the most
complex socially and linguistically.  While <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> is
currently the most important language, it is the first
language of only a small proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>: according
to official estimates for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989-90</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>,
with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> million <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-language <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>, is well behind
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zulu</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xhosa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afrikaans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tswana</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotho</ENAMEX>.  Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is not the only colonial
language of the territory, for since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX> the
ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afrikaner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationalists</ENAMEX> have promoted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afrikaans</ENAMEX>
as an essential language for advancement in
the public service.  Finally, segregational laws in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> have tended to polarize the dialects of English
along partially ethnic lines.  Lexically speaking,
this has tended to produce fragments of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South African</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, rather than a general, roughly homogeneous
variety.

            Such a multilingual environment--and the picture
is made still more complex by other immigrant
languages like <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX> (no longer spoken), <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> languages
(e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tamil</ENAMEX>), as well as indigenous
languages of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khoi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">San</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> now extinct
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>--makes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lexicographer</ENAMEX>'s task at
once difficult and stimulating.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOSAE</ENAMEX> is in
some respects a reflection of the contact history of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>, played out in terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> lexicon.
In its pages can be found linguistic traces of the
former rivalry between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briton</ENAMEX>, the naming
practices of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khoi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hottentot</ENAMEX> and Bushman
in former terms), racial conflict (derogatory
terms like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boer, Kaffir</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hottentot</ENAMEX> each have
more than a page devoted to them), the political
discourse of the apartheid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, and the counter-discourse
of the resistance movements.  The more
positive side of language and culture contact does
show up, however, in the numerous terms for food
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX>, entertainment, the landscape, terms of
endearment, forms of address, and words of approval.
It is also through this and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> editions of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOSAE</ENAMEX> that one learned, to one's surprise, of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South African</ENAMEX> provenance of words like off-load
unload, bottle store liquor store, butchery
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">butcher</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>, and bond mortagage bond.

            According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Branfords</ENAMEX>' own calculations
(made in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>) the source languages for items in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOSAE</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48 per cent</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afrikaans</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> per
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cent English</ENAMEX> (i.e., neologisms); <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 per cent</NUMEX> Bantu
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">languages</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 per cent</NUMEX> other.  The high proportion
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afrikaans</ENAMEX> words has frequently been singled
out for comment by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>.  Some of the items
in this category are words of long standing (since the
introduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape</ENAMEX> in the late eighteenth
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>) that have often passed into international
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">English: trek</ENAMEX>, veld, laager etc.  Other uncontroversial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Afrikaans</ENAMEX> items include political and
culinary terms widely used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>, e.g.,
apartheid and biltong strips of sun-dried lean <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>.
The majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afrikaans</ENAMEX> items, however, are those
which appear in written <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, but rarely
in colloquial <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> (even as spoken
by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afrikaners</ENAMEX>).  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> themselves mention
that some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afrikaans</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> editions of this
text felt that many entries were not really <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South African</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  (They responded by reducing the
number of such entries and by marking others as
borderline cases).

            There is certainly a need for words of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afrikaans</ENAMEX>
origin that recur in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> texts (often for local
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> effect) to be glossed somewhere: a reference
work like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOSAE</ENAMEX> might be more convenient for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> than an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afrikaans</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xhosa</ENAMEX> or some other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX>.  Likewise, it might be necessary for novices
to gloss non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> words that recur in bilingual
road signs and other public notices: apteek
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chemist</ENAMEX>, links left, and the now obsolete blankes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only</NUMEX>) might be truly informative for the
overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX>.  (To be consistent, the DOSAE
would have to indicate the word for left in all languages
that appear in road signs in different parts of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Zulu</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xhosa, Sotho</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tswana</ENAMEX>).

            In their entry for slegs only the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> quote
an amusing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anecdote</ENAMEX> in this regard:


Slegs Only A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX>'s guide to S. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
What are slegs?  a puzzled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> from overseas
asked me.  He had been driving along in a hired
car and had suddenly found himself entering a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lane</ENAMEX> marked SLEGS ONLY.  But how is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX>
expected to know that?  he demanded after I
had explained its meaning [that it was a bilingual
sign].  With the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> divided into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Whites</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coloureds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Blacks</ENAMEX>, how am I to know that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slegs</ENAMEX> isn't another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race group</ENAMEX>?

            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slegs</ENAMEX> is one of the relatively few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">items</ENAMEX> marked in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOSAE</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afrikaans</ENAMEX>, rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>.  I would
argue that this particular signpost does not occur
frequently enough in the book.  For example, as this
marking is absent in the entry, tweetalig bilingual,
we must infer that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> now consider this to
be an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> item.  Yet, the citations they give afford
a clue to the real status of this and numerous
other items in DOSAE : This wall chart, attractive
... and tweetalig nogal [bilingual, what's more], is
to be distributed to all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>....  and  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Four</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in the charge office as a fraud <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detective</ENAMEX>.  That
was where I learned to speak <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afrikaans</ENAMEX> She is heel-temal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tweetalig</ENAMEX> [totally bilingual] and ... studied
art in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>.

            Surely we are dealing with code-switching here
--the use of words and phrases from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> languages
within the same speech event for stylistic effect,
with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> that is capable of appreciating the
play on words.  Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afrikaans</ENAMEX> words in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOSAE</ENAMEX> are similarly illustrated from examples involving
bilingual word play by creative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>.  The
problem for the lexicographer is that code-switching
is open-ended: almost any word or phrase from the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> language can be interpolated into discourse
from the other.  It is also in practice difficult to decide
between the process of borrowing (which dictionaries
must concern themselves with) and code-switching.
This is not a problem peculiar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOSAE</ENAMEX> ;
rather, it is one of the strongest challenges facing
lexicographers of a vast number of languages in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-first century</TIMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> continues to spread,
influence, and be influenced by languages all over
the world in situations of intimate language contact.

            On the whole, I recommend DOSAE highly for
anyone wishing to get to grips with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> who are faced with a
barrage of acronyms in everyday usage will find
many of them glossed in these pages.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOSAE</ENAMEX> shows
attention to detail, provides extensive definitions
with detailed cross references, has broad phonetic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptions</ENAMEX> and, above all, provides delightful illustrative
sentences from historical and contemporary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.

            Every literate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> has had experience with
indexes and knows that there are good ones and bad
ones.  It often astonishes me that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>--at
whose door such shortcomings must be laid--can
put out books that contain a huge amount of valuable
information, then effectively deny access to it by
providing, in the worst case, no index at all and, in
many instances, an improverished index.  As one who
has prepared indexes of great variety, I recognize
the many problems that one can encounter; still,
these are not insurmountable, and there is no excuse
for producing a work of some complexity without
accompanying it by a thorough index.  The important
thing is the notion of thoroughness: the indexer
must try to anticipate and provide for a variety of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>' needs in an index; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> do not seek the same
sort of information, and the effort must be made to
imagine the uses to which a particular work will be
put, then to provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many</NUMEX> access
points to the information as can reasonably be expected.
On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> occasion in these pages
have I lamented the absence of an index (or of a
useful, usable <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>) in a book that contains much valuable
information.

            Probably the greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offenders</ENAMEX> were those who
produced the earlier manuals accompanying computers
and software: many of us had the experience
of reading through a manual the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time only to
find, later, on seeking the format of a certain command,
that there was no index, that the index had
not been updated to conform to the latest (looseleaf)
version of the text, or that the item sought was not
listed; the only solution was to go through the entire
text, laboriously turning each page to find the lost
information.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s manuals are much improved,
but they still rely on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>' knowledge of the
jargon of the computer trade, and much frustrating
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> is still spent trying to find a given bit of information
(while trying to imagine what a computer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">programmer would be likely to</ENAMEX> have called it because
he was unfamiliar with the jargon of writing,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">editing</ENAMEX>, styling, composition, or the other arts and
crafts associated with publishing).

            I have had considerable experience in preparing
indexes--some simple and straightforward, some
highly detailed and sophisticated--for a wide variety
of books.  As I have dealt mainly with texts that
were in machine-readable form, I have been able to
develop techniques for extracting an index from a
text, especially if the text is consistently styled typographically.
In other words, if information type A
is consistently set in italics, type B in bold-face
italics, type C in small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX>, and type <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boldface roman</ENAMEX>, if type E always appears in single
quotation marks, and so forth, one can use this information
to extract discrete categories of data for a
variety of purposes.

            Not all text is so highly stylized, and the present
work deals with biographies, autobiographies, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fiction</ENAMEX>, which offer little opportunity for automatic
extraction because the subjects suitable for indexing
are often paraphrases of the words used in the text.
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bell</ENAMEX> cites this example from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Longford</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biography</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byron</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hutchinson/Weidenfeld</ENAMEX> &
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nicholson, 1976</TIMEX>):


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byron</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Gordon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">6th Lord</ENAMEX>:... his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courtship</ENAMEX> and marriage, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60-79</NUMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byron</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Annabella</ENAMEX>, n√©e <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Millbanke</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX>
... vicissitudes of her marriage, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX>-7

            

            Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bell</ENAMEX> comments that the term vicissitudes
does not occur in the text (and, I daresay, courtship
and marriage do not occur as chapter headings,
either).

            This booklet contains many fascinating insights into
the art of indexing, including, for example, the observation,


... while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> can be subtle and discreet in
their writing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">indexers</ENAMEX> have to condense their implications
to a blunt label--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HOMOSEXUAL TENDENCIES</ENAMEX>,
for instance; we cannot hint in indexes.

            As this is a rather specialized work, we cannot
devote the space to the full description that it merits

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Urdang</ENAMEX>
         
         
            A History of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX>,
            Too often, the best books of the past are cast
aside to be replaced by nothing more than a rehash
of them, frequently rifling earlier material on the
legalistic grounds that it is out of copyright.  To
those wont to steep themselves in the writings of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th century</TIMEX>, a period marked by an emergence of
scholarship and of the broad dissemination of knowledge,
plumbing the delights of those writings not
only for their content but for their controlled and
mannered style yields great satisfaction.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> must
be especially grateful to those who, rather than cast
it aside as old-fashioned or outdated, undertake to
modernize a classic, a policy that too few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>
pursue.

            For me and scores of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
of language and literature, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.C. Baugh</ENAMEX>'s book
was the primer, the basic grammar on the history of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  Long before the invention of the clich√©
user-friendly , that was an apt description of the
Baugh , a work to be relied upon for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX>, accuracy,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">readability</ENAMEX>.  Later, it became a useful reference,
always handy on a nearby shelf, to which one
could turn in those irritating lapses of memory of the
niggling detail.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baugh</ENAMEX>'s History was published
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1935</TIMEX>; because so much has happened to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> since then, it is fitting that its history be updated,
not only to reflect more recent developments
in dialect, lexicon, grammatical theory, and the universal
adoption of the language as a lingua franca,
but also to revise scholarship in the light of later
research that either elaborates or confutes information
that is now <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century old</TIMEX>.  Although
I was surprised to note (on the title page)
that this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> edition of the work, ignorance
of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> editions must be put down to
my own failing.  The present <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Texas</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX>, has exercised
restraint in meddling with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baugh</ENAMEX>'s original
text, having focused mainly on those areas--dialect,
modern grammatical theory, and, generally, the
work of later <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>--that could not have been
treated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1935</TIMEX>.  It is suggested that the next edition
include a more comprehensive section on dictionaries,
perhaps of lesser importance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> times but
increasingly the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> of information about
language for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, reflected in a recent report
that more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> own a dictionary than a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Urdang</ENAMEX>
         
         
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of English Place Names</ENAMEX>,
            This book, already reviewed in VERBATIM
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>], is now available in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of Worship</ENAMEX>...


            Now that everyone has had the chance to listen to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">I Saw Her Standing</ENAMEX> There , it is time to
take a deeper look at the meaning of the lyrics.
Sometimes a more critical and profound analysis can
be unexpectedly rewarding.

            Let us look at the first line:


Well, she was just seventeen

            

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> has recently had a birthday; there may
be--though we cannot be sure--a veiled reference
to her now being old enough to drive a motorcar.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> line:


You know what I mean

            

            is pure emphasis.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> is in some doubt as to
whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listener</ENAMEX> has paid sufficient attention to
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> line.  Concentrate, he appears to be saying,
every word counts.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> line:

            And the way she looked was beyond compare
implies that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'s appearance was unique.  It is
impossible to say what she is like, because she is like
nothing else.

            In line <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>,


How could I dance with another?

            

            we are introduced to the dilemma caused by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'s singular looks.  Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> cannot be contemplated
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>: this is a poignant predicament.

            But there is hope in lines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>:

Oh, when I saw her standing there,
Well she looked at me
            

            Is there a chance that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> reciprocates the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boy</ENAMEX>'s admiration?  Is this looking the means by
which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> may be induced to request the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> on the dance floor?  Is she perhaps as enamored
of him as he is of her?  And if they do
meet--and we sense they will--can their relationship
endure?  The answer is in verse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, which we
shall be looking at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>.  Please stand for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hymn</ENAMEX>....
         
         
            Is it doable, do you think?



            Not long ago in an article on word-processing I
came across the word doable .  I could not remember
having seen it before--but, then, my memory for
words frequently lets me down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>.  I wondered
how it is pronounced.  And what does it
mean?

            So to the dictionaries.  First, to my trusty Gage
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> , which defines it as that can be done
and gives the pronunciation as [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doo-uhb'l</ENAMEX>].  The
same definition and pronunciation are given in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX> and in the recent edition of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concise Oxford</ENAMEX> .  I then went to my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3rd</TIMEX> edition of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concise Oxford</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1934</TIMEX>): it does not give the word,
which caused me to think that it probably is a recently
fabricated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and that I should not worry
about it.  Surely, I thought, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED Supplement</ENAMEX> will
have something on it.  Nothing.  So to my magnifying-glass
edition of the unsupplemented one.  It had
doable , with the same definition and pronunciation
given in those other dictionaries, with this additional
definition, practicable.  It also gives a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> definition:
Capable of being done or victimized.  The
earliest instance of its use given is A law ... which
is doable--from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1449</TIMEX>.

            All this sent me into intense research into the
word do .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basil Cottle</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bristol</ENAMEX>, in his useful little book, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Plight of English</ENAMEX> ,
devotes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly four</NUMEX> pages to it, describing it at
the beginning as a deplorable little syllable.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emphatic</ENAMEX> use of do has long been used in our language.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Johnson</ENAMEX> deplored the superfluous,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emphatic</ENAMEX> use of do , as in I do love: he
considered it vitious.  We all use the emphatic do ,
and that is not always undesirable: I do believe ... ;
I do so want to see her; Do have a drink.  The
Gage <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> gives <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> distinct definitions for do,
along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> common idiomatic phrases using it.
The abridged edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Partridge</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Historical Slang</ENAMEX> gives <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than five</NUMEX> columns
to idioms beginning with do , from do a beer to do
you see the green in my eye?
            

            Then there is How do you do? --which actually
is not a question but a genteel response between
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who have just been introduced to one another.
Quite different from it is How are you doing?,
although the grammatical difference seems slight.
Do is a remarkably versatile verb.  You can do your
washing.  Or the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rocky Mountains</ENAMEX>.  Or your income
tax.  Or your thing.

            And there is the simple interrogatory do: Do
you see what I mean?  Do you have the time?  (That
apparently is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brits</ENAMEX>, one of them
told me, say Have you the time? )

            
               I lisped in numbers ...

            A recent news item in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>] published in the international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">press</ENAMEX> presumably
to call delighted attention to the obtuseness of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of police</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dearborn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>, concerned
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> who was suspended for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX>
to seek psychiatric help in disabusing himself of
his obsession for writing the figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> with a bar
through it to distinguish it from the figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, a disambiguating
practice long followed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> where
it is the practice to write <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to look like the left
half of an upward-pointing arrow.  The incident reminds
me that for some time I have intended to comment
on the way numerals are said in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> and in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>, though I am not entirely sure whether the
subject is properly linguistic, cultural, or categorizable
into some other area of behavior.  In any event,
I cannot recall ever having seen any comment on it
(but then I do not read books on the teaching of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as a second <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX>).

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, when a numeral is repeated in, say, a
telephone, credit-card, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, or other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX>, the
word double is used to describe it: thus, for instance,
the VERBATIM telephone in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aylesbury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">395880 ,</ENAMEX>
would be uttered as, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>, double-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>,
oh (or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, but oh is more common).  If
there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> identical numerals in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a row</TIMEX>, as in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">267444</NUMEX> , they would be read as, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>, double-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> sevens in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a row</TIMEX> would be,
double-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>, double-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>.  Occasionally, I have
heard a string like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">666666</NUMEX> expressed as, treble-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>,
treble-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>, but double-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>, double-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>, double-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
is probably more frequent, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>, double-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>,
double-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> can be heard.  A recent radio advertisement
contained the number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">888777</NUMEX> , read as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>,
double-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>, double-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>.  The exception
that I have noted is in the naming of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0800</TIMEX> (free)
numbers, where the practice in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> follows that
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>: oh, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight hundred</NUMEX>.

            This style takes a little getting-used-to; I find
that when I say, out of habit, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>, double-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>,
oh, to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, they hesitate ever so
slightly before fully understanding.  Gone are the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> when one picked up the old upright phone, was
greeted by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX>, and told her--it was always
her--the number one wanted; with that antediluvian
routine went such memorable tunes as, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Hello</ENAMEX>,
Central?  Give me haven, for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s there.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">One</ENAMEX> might also observe that, despite inflation,
other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> telephonic archaisms persist in the
culture, like, I put <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a nickel</NUMEX> in the telephone to dial
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s number, It's your nickel, etc.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> may not be
aware that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> telephone dials (now pads ) still
retain alphabetical sequences from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> when
local telephone numbers contained names, like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEnnsylvania Six</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thousand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BUtterfield</ENAMEX> 8
(usually so written): everyone knew that the first
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> letters of the name were to be dialed--PE <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6-5000,</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">BU 8-.</ENAMEX>  In its infinite wisdom, the telephone
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> long ago abandoned words for numbers,
having perceived that there were some number
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">combinations</ENAMEX> (like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX>) could not be readily yielded
by familiar names.  The letters were, however, retained
on the instruments, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> telephones
group them this way (wisely, there is no Q):)


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   0</NUMEX>

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>  DEF  GHI  JKL  MNO  PRS  TUV  WXY  Z

            

            Also, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> could not occur among
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> digits, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, it
cannot be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> digit (in contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, where
all dialling codes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>: area codes ) begin with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>,
as, I believe, do all international codes, universally.
In my memory, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> telephones have never
had letters, but I am sure that I will be quickly corrected
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> if I am wrong.

            There must have been confusion--perhaps it
persists--about the alphabetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> [oh] and the numerical
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>], for the telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> often
made a special point of emphasizing which was
meant: I assume that they have statistics on the number
of wrong numbers dialed when one was substituted
for the other.  But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> of all-digit
telephone numbers, the tendency, particularly
among younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, who seem to get confused
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> such things, is to make certain that the word
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">zero</ENAMEX> is used, rather than oh.  I admit that zero
does remove any ambiguity in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>; but,
without letters on telephones, how could it arise in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe</ENAMEX>?

            Ever resourceful, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> quickly recognized
that they could use part or all of their telephone
letters as a mnemonic.  For example, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> in stolen
automobiles with the telephone number <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">468-2277</ENAMEX>
could tell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> to dial HOT <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">CARS</ENAMEX>; a psychiatric
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinic</ENAMEX> with the number <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">578-6887</TIMEX> could tell
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to phone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R U NUTS</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U R NUTS</ENAMEX>); dial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLUMBER</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">758-6237</ENAMEX>) if you have a leak, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COLLEGE</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">265-5343</ENAMEX>) to register for extention <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PASSION</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">727-7466</ENAMEX>) to satisfy cravings, KWIKFIT
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">594-5348</ENAMEX>) (but not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ZIPPER</ENAMEX>, because a number
cannot start with a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>) for emergency
tailoring services, etc.  Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omnigraphics</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX>, has published a fat book,
Phonames, that lists all the possible <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-letter combinations
in numerical order and, for those who
might persuade their local telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> to
change their number to coincide with a desired
word or command, alphabetically as well.  I understand
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Coast Guard</ENAMEX> emergency number
was to have been changed to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">746-5464</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SINKING</ENAMEX>),
but it was decided that it might be too late by the
time the call went through.  In an earlier issue of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> have commented on what have
come to be called bacronyms, names of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>,
products, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX>, and other institutions that
have been chosen solely because their acronyms
yield words that are pronounceable, meaningful, or
both.  Here we have the numerical equivalent.

            It will be noted, that the grouping of the numbers
differs from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX> retains
xxx-xxxx, presumably as a hangover from the old
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of telephone name-calling; in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, the
(older) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-digit and the (newer) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-digit numbers
are written solid: xxxxx(x); on the Continent, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-digit
numbers are written in sets of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">xx-xx-xx</ENAMEX>.
Newer seven-digit numbers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> are written
xxx-xxxx, as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>.  Which of these patterns has
a better mnemonic advantage it is hard to say.  Does
anyone use xxx-xxx?

            The literal-minded among us have fastened on
the inaccuracy of the retained word dial for what
many now have on telephones.  The noun presents
no real problem, for the term (number) pad already
exists to describe the calculatorlike array.  But pad
proves unsatisfactory as a verb.  Press seems to have
been pressed into service: but I put <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a quarter</NUMEX> [ or
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten-pence</TIMEX> (or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> pee)] in the telephone to press
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s number just does not seem to have the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX> ring.

            In response to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>'s complaint that his restaurant
reviews were becoming increasingly pretentious,
with descriptions of the ... food ... sublimated
to [his] profound architectural knowledge and
appreciation of interior design, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Meades</ENAMEX>,
the subject reviewer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Sunday Times</ENAMEX> suited the
word to the action:


I admit to an interest in architecture and interior
design.  But then so do many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">restaurateurs</ENAMEX>.
I do not, however, allow the sublimity or bathos
of a setting to blind me to the attributes of its
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>.  Points are awarded for cooking--
although the cooking, bad or good, is often not so
fascinating as the tectonic or social aspects of a
particular place.  Making an inventory of a menu
is a task for guidebooks.  Me, I write only about
what I've tasted.

The average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>, who might require a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX>, and the normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX>, with an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antipathy</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and sweetbreads, strike
me as being the putative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gastro-brothers</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toniben</ENAMEX>'s ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working man</ENAMEX> or the man
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clapham</ENAMEX> omnibus.  These <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">epithets</ENAMEX> grow
ever more presumptuous, ever more patronising
in the context of an ever more factional, furcated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX>.  Whose palate and attitudes other than
my own could I possibly use?

            
         
         
            As some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> are aware, the teaching of English
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolchildren</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> has been undergoing
great upheaval of late: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Union of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teachers</ENAMEX>, the largest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>, recently voted overwhelmingly
(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>) to boycott a compulsory
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> test for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14-year-olds</TIMEX> by refusing to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mark</ENAMEX>, administer, or invigilate [proctor] them.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Patten</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX>, is, according
to The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 February 1993</TIMEX>], said to be anxious
for standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> to be introduced without endangering
regional variations.  <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ian Small</ENAMEX>, headmaster
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bootham School</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">York</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> on English
in the leading independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, is quoted
as saying, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> have been
working their socks off to encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> to
write well and effectively, and if all that work was in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vain</ENAMEX>, it will be a great pity, a footling remark in the
circumstances.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> reports that the new curriculum
will include a reading list of classic works,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> will be expected to use capital letters
and full stops [periods] correctly by the age of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>, commas by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>, apostrophes and speech marks
by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>, and colons and semi-colons by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>.

 ... for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> had
used the word innocent rather than not guilty
when referring to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> [killed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>

            Perhaps one of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> steeped in legal lore
would care to comment on whether there is a legal

            In a letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Sunday Times</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 February</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>], a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leicester</ENAMEX> called attention to a bit
of a cockup in which an article on the delights of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sardinia</ENAMEX> recommended a certain dish.  He wrote
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> pene frattau, which means penis with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sheep</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>, tomato, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>.  I hope he meant
pane frattau.

            During the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commons</ENAMEX> debate on the

playing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> in general, and level playing fields

times.

that our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charity</ENAMEX> derives no direct benefit from the
extensive use of what seems to have become the

            Would <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPs</ENAMEX>, and others, consider making a small

            For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> I was under the impression that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dryden</ENAMEX> had inveighed against the ending of a
sentence with a preposition, and I have included
mention of it now and then in my writing.  The interdiction
is meaningless for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> grammar (or
style), having been carried over from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>, where a
preposition must accompany the word it is connected
with syntactically and semantically; like the
caveat concerning split infinitives, which cannot be
split in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin</ENAMEX> because, as in most other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">languages</ENAMEX>, they are single words, unsplittable
nuclei, unlike the atom,

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few months ago</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> wrote saying that
he had encountered my mention of it but had been
unable to find any reference in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dryden</ENAMEX>'s writings.
At the time I did not reply, because I did not have
the time to search for it.  Now that I have found it, I
cannot remember who queried me about it, but I
might as well present the information once and for
all in these pages in case anyone else wishes to
know.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Defence of the Epilogue</ENAMEX>,
or, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">An Essay on the Dramatic Poetry of the Last</ENAMEX>
Age, published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1672</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almanzor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Almahide</ENAMEX>,
or, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Conquest of Granada by the Spaniards</ENAMEX>,
which had been roundly criticized, especially for its
language.

Tully so much complains in oratory.

The preposition in the end of the sentence; a
common fault with him, and which I have but
lately observed in my own writings.

            The quotations are from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catiline</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Johnson</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">whom Dryden</ENAMEX> held in very high regard, a most judicious
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dryden</ENAMEX>, if not a purist, was certainly
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traditionalist</ENAMEX> and a precisian in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX>:


To begin with Language.  That an alteration is
lately made in ours, or since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last age</TIMEX> (in which I comprehend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fletcher</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jonson</ENAMEX>), is manifest.  Any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who
reads those excellent poets and compares their
language with what is now written, will see it in
almost every line; but that this is an improvement
of the language, or an alteration for the better,
will not so easily be granted.  For many are of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">countrary</ENAMEX> opinion, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> tongue was
then in the height of its perfection; that from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jonson</ENAMEX>'s
time to ours it has been in a continual declination,
like that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> from the age of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virgil to Statius</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quintilian</ENAMEX> himself so much
complains, under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secundus</ENAMEX>, in his
famous dialogue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Causis corruptae Eloquentiae</ENAMEX>.

But, to show that our language is improved,
and that those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have not a just value for
the age in which they live, let us consider in what
the refinement of a language principally consists:
that is, either in rejecting such old words, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phrases</ENAMEX>, which are ill sounding, or improper; or in
admitting new, which are more proper, more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sounding</ENAMEX>, and more significant.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> will easily take notice, that when I
speak of rejecting improper words and phrases, I
mention not such as are antiquated by custom
only, and, as I may say, without any fault of
theirs.  For in this case the refinement can be but
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accidental</ENAMEX>; that is, when the words and phrases
which are rejected happen to be improper.  Neither
would I be understood, when I speak of impropriety
of language, either wholly to accuse the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last age</TIMEX>, or to excuse the present, and least of all
myself.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ibid., p. 97</ENAMEX>. [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Italics</ENAMEX> not mine.]

            

            It is interesting to observe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dryden</ENAMEX>, born only
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> after the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>, should a
mere <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years later</TIMEX> regard him as being of another
age: clearly, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three centuries</TIMEX> ago <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had quite a
perception of time different from our own, largely, I
believe, brought about by our more thorough documentation
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past hundred years</TIMEX> in books, newspapers
and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">periodicals</ENAMEX>, photographs, films,
and, more recently, videos.

            He comments on the errors in the writings of
the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> that are cited <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> either in a
derisory tone or as an excuse for our own shortcomings:


[A]<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ll writers</ENAMEX> have their imperfections and failings:
but I may safely conclude in the general,
that our improprieties are less frequent and less
gross than theirs....  [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>]alice and partiality set
apart, let any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who understands <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, read
diligently the works of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fletcher</ENAMEX>,
and I dare undertake that he will find in every
page either some solecism of speech, or some notorious
flaw in sense; and yet these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are reverenced,
when we are not forgiven.

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ibid., p. 98</ENAMEX>.
            

            Lest the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> think of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dryden</ENAMEX> as a stuffy purist,
here he is on neologisms:


As for the other part of refining, which consists
in receiving new words and pharases, I shall not
insist much on it.  It is obvious that we have admitted
many, some of which we wanted, and
therefore our language is the richer for them, as
it would be by importation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bullion</ENAMEX>: other are
rather ornamental than necessary; yet by their
admission, the language is become more courtly,
and our thoughts are better dressed.  These are to
be found scattered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> of our age, and
it is not my business to collect them.  They, who
have lately written with most care, have, I believe,
taken the rule of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horace</ENAMEX> for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX>;
that is, not to be too hasty in receiving of words,
but rather to stay till custom has made them familiar
to us:


Multa renascentur quae nunc cecidere,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cadentque</ENAMEX>;

Quae nunc sunt honore in vocabula, si volet
usus,

Quam penes, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">arbitrium est</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX> jus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et norma</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loquendi</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ars Poetica</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-2.

[Many words which have now fallen out of
use will be reborn, and many now prominent
will disappear, if usage, which owns the right
to decide, and the law, and the canons of
speech, so choose.]


For I cannot approve of their way of refining,
who corrupt our <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> idiom by mixing it too
much with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>: that is a sophistication of language,
not an improvement of it; a turning English
into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, rather than a refining of English
by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.

closer to smacking of sophistry.)
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Description/Proscription/Style</ENAMEX>


            As we have observed in these pages on numerous
occasions, the professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">linguist</ENAMEX>'s avowed position
with regard to usage is similar to that of a
medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>'s in relation to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>: both are
charged with the responsibility of observing the
phenomena they encounter without expressing qualitative
opinions about them.  That is, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> is
not supposed to express his loathing or disgust at the
manifestations of some horrible affliction, nor is it
deemed proper for him to assume an accusatory posture
reflected in expressions like, What a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool</ENAMEX> you
are for having exposed yourself to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX> waste-away
!

            The analogy is not entirely apt, however, for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> cannot always be held responsible for catching
the disease and might not be able to do anything
about its cure, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who misspells a
word, utters grammatical solecisms, or uses infer for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">imply</ENAMEX> has resourse to remedial measures.  In many
cases, it must be acknowledged, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">writer</ENAMEX> has not been exposed to the opportunities
that would enable him to distinguish between what
is regarded as standard usage versus nonstandard,
hence, it might be said that he is not responsible for
using nonstandard <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  But, surely, someone
must accept the blame, and that someone ought to
be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who employed what we have learned
from innumerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> shows on television to call the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perp</ENAMEX>.
            

            The cable television <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Lyme</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, area is (apparently) forbidden to transmit
certain programs because the transmission rights
have been preempted by another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>.  In such
circumstances, a message appears on the screen that
explains, in quasi-legalistic terms, why the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX> is
looking at the message instead of the program.
Among the words used is pursuant , which is spelled
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">persuant</ENAMEX>.  This message has been appearing on
the screen with that misspelling for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> (or more), and the cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> maintains
that the card bearing the message is provided to
them with the proviso that it be transmitted as is.
Because the notice appears almost every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> on
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> and remains on the screen for at
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">least thrity minutes</TIMEX> on end, its exposure is far
greater than that of a fleeting utterance by a newscaster
or a similar written message that appears only
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fleetingly</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> cannot help thinking that an entire
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX>--assuming they are able to
read at all--is growing up learning how to misspell
pursuant.  Pursuant is a legal term, of course, not one
that drops readily from the lips of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housewife</ENAMEX> or
casual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> of the rock 'n' roll scene on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTV</ENAMEX>.
Thus, with some justification, one might well ask,
Who cares?  And there are always those who will
accuse me of being a purist, which I do not think I
am.  On the other hand, I try not to be a linguistic
slob, either.

            If one asks a professional linguist why he doesn't
say things like He don't or spell pursuant persuant,
the reply is likely to be,  He don't is not
part of my speech pattern, and I simply do not
spell pursuant that way.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> may accept that sort
of statement at face value; in my view, it would have
been more accurate (and honest) to say, I wouldn't
be caught dead saying He don't,  etc.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26 November</TIMEX>) I was watching Biography
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arts & Entertainment</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>.  In
the course of the program, which was about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">royal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, there appeared on the screen a
number of titles identifying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> or place pictured.
In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such title, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father-in-law</ENAMEX>
was identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furguson</ENAMEX>; in another,
the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Charles</ENAMEX>'s wedding was
identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Pauls</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carhederal</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ].  Aside
from the fact that the program was rather poorly
done, how are we to react to this sort of thing?
Should we throw up our hands, saying, Anyone can
make a mistake or What difference does it
make?  or You are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to talk: look at all
the mistakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>?  As for the last, I would
protest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A&E</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> has resources far beyond
those available for the proofreading of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is merely a vapid truism.  But what
about the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>?

            I am moved to offer some armchair psychological
analysis.  For many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, their ability to relate
to reality is inexorably tied to their control of language,
the greatest common denominator of our understanding
of the real world.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Berkeleian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosophers</ENAMEX>
need not waste their time writing me on this
subject.)  For such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, we might say that their
very grip on reality depends on their control of language:
it is their security blanket, the corners of
which they chew with everlasting self-satisfaction
and in which they wind themselves for protection
against the hostile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> that would shake the foundations
of their traditionalism.  If their language is
threatened, they are threatened.  Put another way,
the acceptance of nonstandard language to replace
the comfortable protection offered by linguistic purism
amounts to moving the goalposts in a game that
they have been playing for their entire lives according
to a different set of rules.

            As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of these occasional notes on English
are well aware, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> standard usage now condones
the use of the indicative where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subjunctive</ENAMEX> formerly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reigned</ENAMEX> and, to mention just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other obvious
phenomenon, the use of the plural pronouns of
reference for what have traditionally been regarded
as singular referents (as in Everyone should bring
their book to class <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> ).  The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> changes are
different, of course: the former marks a final succumbing
to the relentless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of the indicative:
the weakening of the subjunctive might be regarded
as a rejection of the tolerance of uncertainty on the
part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>, perhaps a product of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late-20th-century</TIMEX>
obsession with the facts, resulting in insecurity
when faced with doubt, with low probability,
or with contrary-to-fact situations.  The issue of pronoun
agreement might be laid at the door of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX>' misguided interference with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of
language, resulting in a nervous rejection of the
masculine pronoun as the neutral <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>; but, in truth,
the sustenance of the singular nature of words like
each, everybody, everyone, etc. is probably pedantry,
for sense and logic are not sacrificed by
changing them to plurals, with the added benefit of
avoiding the dreaded he/his/him, regarded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX>
as the bearer of the stigma of male machismo.
In many cases, the paraphrase, All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> should
bring their books to class <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> , and similar pluralizations
will conveniently turn the trick without
distorting the meaning.

            One is led to considering the establishment of a
hierarchy of the heinousness.  For instance, I have a very
low tolerance for spelling errors and grammatical solecisms
in letters of application from those soliciting
work: job <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX> who are too careless to correct
the capitalization of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">california</ENAMEX> and the spelling
Britian get short shrift, though I am more tolerant
of those using presently for now .  A great deal can be
determined from a personal interview--somewhat
more complicated with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicant</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousand</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> away--but dialect differences must be accounted
for, too.  For instance, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> use the
word machismo (but pronounce it, almost invariably,
as if it were a loanword from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, with a - k -where
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">- tch -</ENAMEX>).  Yet macho is uttered
with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">- tch -</ENAMEX>, possibly to distinguish it from one of the
pronunciations of the word for a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shark</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OED2e</ENAMEX> is not tuned in to this pronunciation of
machismo , showing only the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">- tch</ENAMEX> - pronunciation; the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman</ENAMEX> and the newer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford Concise</ENAMEX> show both,
but with - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tch</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>; only the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX> , of those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
dictionaries I checked, shows the - k - pronunciation
as prevalent.  One professional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> lexicographer
told me, categorically, that no one uses the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">- tch</ENAMEX> - pronunciation
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, where it would be regarded as
wrong or pedantic.  If he is right, then those who
show it at all are merely genuflecting in the direction
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purists</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin Names</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIX</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,44</NUMEX>], it would be appropriate to

names, adjudicated by a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Code</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacterial Nomenclature</ENAMEX>.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Some years ago</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Congressman</ENAMEX>

            Your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">breezy</TIMEX> note on street names [OBITER
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DICTA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Name Withheld</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XIX,2,20</NUMEX>], suggested certain
categories that might lend more pizzazz to the
scene.  As the result of observation over a period of
many years of driving through or past suburban residential
developments within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half hour</TIMEX> of my
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, I have induced principles of street taxonomy,
by sheer inference, that demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> in
such places are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">designated by</ENAMEX>:

            (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Surnames</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> or business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developer</ENAMEX> which, for some reason tend to be less
than euphonious--at least in my universe: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unruh</ENAMEX>,
Hoffnagle, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gilham, Solly, Alburger, Napfle, Knorr</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borbeck</ENAMEX>.
            

            (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)  Given names of family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the developer
or his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, primarily to celebrate wives
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Drive</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Lynn Lane</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elizabeth Road, Delia</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexis Lane</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andrew</ENAMEX> [and] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelly</ENAMEX> [Street].
            

            (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)  Names of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, presumably to memorialize
those that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developer</ENAMEX> has just caused to be
chopped down: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple, Birch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Walnut</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sycamore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ash</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beech, Spruce and Locust Street/Roads/Avenue/Lane</ENAMEX> .


            Of course these principles do not account for all
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> in a particular development and do not
necessarily apply in all developments, but I cannot
be responsible for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developer</ENAMEX>'s ignorance of my
findings or for his aberrant conduct in disregarding
them.



         
         

            The comment about street names reminded me
of a punning name in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> for which credit must
probably go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Company</ENAMEX>.  Several
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> they built a transmission <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX>
and had to make a new access road, for which
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> chose the name, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front Wheel Drive</ENAMEX>.
            



         
         

            I was intrigued by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leslie Brunetta</ENAMEX>'s description
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surnames</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Frailty</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thy Name</ENAMEX> is Bevilacqua
[XIX<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2,1</NUMEX>], in particular of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bevilacqua</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B√©vivino.</ENAMEX>  It recalled a meeting, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years ago</TIMEX>, of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal and Publicity Committee of the Professional</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of the Public Service of Canada</ENAMEX>.

            It was revealed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Drinkwater</ENAMEX>,
had been hired by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boivin</ENAMEX> , of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Directors</ENAMEX>.
At that point, someone remarked that The
fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boivin</ENAMEX> hired Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drinkwater</ENAMEX> surely
must tell us something about the two predominant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linguistic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boileau</ENAMEX> is also a common <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> name.  Yet, despite
the existence of English names like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winthrop</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windsor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Winston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winchester</ENAMEX>, etc. appears to reveal
vestigers of a one-time thriving <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> wine industry,
one has yet to come across a Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drinkwine</ENAMEX>,
surely a deficiency in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as a world language.

            The comments on street names [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XIX,2,20</NUMEX>] recalls
that I live on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nepean Street</ENAMEX>, but the mailing
label of my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> subscription persists in
showing it as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE PEAN</ENAMEX> (suggesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pean</ENAMEX>?), despite attempts to have it corrected.  On
the other hand, that error comes in handy when I
receive junk mail, for I now know who is selling my
name to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">distributors</ENAMEX> of such mail.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">creations</ENAMEX>, uttered while dining at a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>:
the menu item oeuf russe was described by
the waiter as a hard-boiled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> having its yolk
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chopped</ENAMEX>, seasoned and restored into the cooked
white.  I ordered it and it was served as a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> white,
duly stuffed, prompting me to exclaim, A <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half an</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> is not an oeuf .



         
         
            [ In my (vast) culinary experience, the term is oeuf √† la
Russe, and it consists merely of a hard-boiled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>, cut
in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> lengthwise, served with a mustardy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mayonnaise</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> and, if one is lucky, a caper or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.  The
stuffed egg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX> is described, within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cordon</ENAMEX> culinaire
that I frequent, as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">deviled egg</ENAMEX> and is usually
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with canap√©s served bugget style at picnics,
and similar <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al</ENAMEX> fresco affairs. --<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX>]
         
         

            In Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Brashear</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hocus Pocus</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIX</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 1</ENAMEX>], the nonsensical magical words from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goethe</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reineke Fuchs</ENAMEX>, nekrast negibaul geid sum manteflih
dnudna mein tedachs make sense when the words are
read backwards (with some anagrammatical liberties):

            What a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clich√©</ENAMEX>!  recalls the mixed metaphors
quoted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The News</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boca Raton</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 8, 1992</TIMEX>], attributed
to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of political
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Rosenbaum</ENAMEX>:


Because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> is on the leading edge of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">graying of America</ENAMEX>, this study raises new concerns
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about</NUMEX> a growing gulf between young and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX> and the possibility of a national backlash
against the aging.

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen Marcus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairwoman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palm Beach</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">County Board of County Commissioners</ENAMEX>, issued a directive
at a meeting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1992</TIMEX> (evidently a good
vintage year for mixed metaphors) in which she said,


...so that you don't need to spin your wheels
until you have something to sink your teeth
into.

            

            At the same meeting, the lone male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX>
noted that something would open up a whole ball
of wax.



         
         

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Berlyne</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Front Back-axle</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">XIX, 3, 29</ENAMEX>],
finds it beyond understanding how the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> word
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pony</ENAMEX> (which he believes to be borrowed from ponytail )
has come to stand for fringe or bangs in the
sense of hair combed forward over the forehead.
However, in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, pony (or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pony</ENAMEX> hair ) has always signified that hairstyle, even
long before the ponytail came into fashion.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pony</ENAMEX> is
not a shortening of ponytail but an immigrant in its
own right, and undoubtedly the older of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.
