(The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Carnival of the Elements</ENAMEX>)



            Like the weather, atoms nowadays are freely
talked about but the ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> rarely
does anything about them.  We know that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is
H2O and (if we are sufficiently dyspeptic) that baking
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">soda</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NaHCO3</TIMEX>; and it is generally agreed that uranium
is quite heavy and that certain isotopes of it can
be manipulated in such a way as to make a very big
bang.  Some of us may even take a slightly perverse
delight in the ability to rattle off the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>-odd
names of the elements to the tune of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sullivan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Major General</ENAMEX>, thanks to the jeu
d'esprit of a brash young <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> junior-faculty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statistician</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1950s</TIMEX>.
            

            Very few of us, however, can say why the symbol
for sodium is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Na</ENAMEX>, why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quicklime</ENAMEX> should remind us of
a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist preacher</ENAMEX>, or what the secret
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredient</ENAMEX> in a popular variety of ersatz <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamond</ENAMEX> has
to do with a little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in the southern end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>
and near the end of the alphabet.

            The following article makes no attempt to be a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-minute</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chem 101</ENAMEX> crash course for the perplexed, but,
it is hoped, should at least provide you with counter-ammunition
the next time someone corners you at a
party and starts dropping terms such as stoichiometry
as the temperature of your beer rises slowly but inexorably
from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cellar</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">attic</ENAMEX>.

            It is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Attica</ENAMEX> that we begin, for the notion that the
many complex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> with which we are surrounded
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life might in reality be compounded
from a much smaller number of basic elements is documented
as far back as the golden age of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> we are accustomed to thinking of elements and
atoms as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and the same; to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX>, atoms and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> represented efforts by different philosophic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> to explain the discrepancy between appearances
and the true nature of things.

            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aristotle</ENAMEX>, it was the qualitative pluralist
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empedocles</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">484-424 B.C.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E.</ENAMEX>) who first argued
that everything was fundamentally reducible to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> earth, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, air and fire (or sunlight) in different
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proportions</ENAMEX>, but, as one classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observes</ENAMEX>, a popular belief in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> as somehow
basic ingredients in nature was much older, possibly
a borrowing from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> atomism was fashioned in a different workshop.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democritus</ENAMEX> (born sometime <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 470</TIMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">457</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B.C.E.)</ENAMEX> maintained that despite our sense perceptions,
in reality there are only atoms and the
void.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aristotle</ENAMEX> says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Democritus</ENAMEX> conceived
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">atomsâ€”the</ENAMEX> word means unsplittables (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">a-</ENAMEX> ,
not-, plus tomos , a cut, section)â€”as being particles
at variance with one another which tend to get
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ensnarled</ENAMEX> and interlocked... fit snugly and so catch
firm hold of one another, for some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> are scalene
while others are sharply hooked, some are concave,
others convex... (As it turns out, atoms don't quite
work this way; but complex molecules, particularly
organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX>, often do, which is why surface
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> of a cell that function as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> sites for
harmful invaders such as viruses can be blocked with
other molecules of the appropriate shape, and why,
when placed in a solution of mixed sugars, some bacteria
flunk the membership test for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clean Plate</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club</ENAMEX> because they can digest dextrose but leave its
mirror image, levulose, untouched.)

            Although the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements paradigm</ENAMEX> remained
robust throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">antiquity</TIMEX> and through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ages</ENAMEX> (during which a mystical tradition emerged
proposing a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> element, ruling the others, the socalled
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quintessence</ENAMEX> ), atomism fell out of favor for
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly two</NUMEX> millennia until the quantitative philosophy
of the early Enlightenment created a conceptual environment
friendly to the metamorphosis of alchemy,
through the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> experiments of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Hooke</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Newton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Priestley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Cavendish</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antoine Lavoisier</ENAMEX> and others, into something like the
chemistry we were all taught in high school.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>'s prejudice, to be sure, sometimes
impeded saving the phenomenon (as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aptly</ENAMEX> called experimental observation).  The year
before the outbreak of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Revolution</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Priestley</ENAMEX> succeeded in removing from air, so he
thought, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX> called phlogiston which was
thought to be what put fires out, and dubbed his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dephlogisticated</ENAMEX> air <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> because he supposed it
to be an essential ingredient of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">oxy -</ENAMEX>,
sharpâ€”as in oxymoron â€”plus - gen , related to the
verb gignomai , I become, happen, am born)
.  Cavendish was much closer to his own mark: in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1766</TIMEX>
he isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen</ENAMEX>, which he correctly perceived
as a building block of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> ( hydro- being the
oblique stem of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> hyder , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>).

            In many instances, finding an element was simply
a matter of recognizing that it was an element
and not a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX>, and had been lying around
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mines</ENAMEX> and workshops since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">antiquity</TIMEX>.  In
place of the alchemical signs still common through
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newton</ENAMEX>'s day in the notation of chemical reactions,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> got assigned symbols of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> letters,
often drawn from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> names for the same substances
because <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> remained the common tongue
for scholarly communication across national and linguistic
borders until well into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>.  Thus
the sign for iron became <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX> (from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> ferrum ), for
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Au</ENAMEX> ( aurum ), for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag</ENAMEX> ( argentum ), for copper
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cu</ENAMEX> (cuprum) , for lead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pb</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">plumbum â€”until</ENAMEX>
steel replaced lead pipe for waterworks, plumbers
were, and had been since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in
lead).

            Other symbols are less straightforward.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sodiumâ€”the</ENAMEX> name is derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda</ENAMEX> , originally
an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> term for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ash</ENAMEX> used in glassmaking and later
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to a number of sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saltsâ€”is Na</ENAMEX>, short
for natron or natrium , a neo-latinate term also
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to a variety of sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX>.  Because
it has the same number of free electrons as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sodium</ENAMEX> is useful in a great many compounds as
a substitute for one of the two atoms of hydrogen
(also valence <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) in a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>.  Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jewelers</ENAMEX>'
pickling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX>, used to dissolve surface sulfides
from precious metals and marketed under such
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX> names as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dixcel</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sparex</ENAMEX>, is sodium hyposulfate
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NaHSO4</TIMEX>;), far less corrosive than the sulfuric
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">acid</ENAMEX>
it replaced in everyday use.  Other common
sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX> are NaHCO3 (sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bicarbonate</ENAMEX>,
or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">baking soda</ENAMEX>, mentioned above), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX> (sodium
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chloride</ENAMEX>, or common table <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorine</ENAMEX> is so
called because in its gaseous form it is greenâ€”
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chlor-</ENAMEX> , as in chlorophyl , which, a vulgar
euphemism for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">manure</ENAMEX> notwithstanding, is what
really makes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> grow green), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaOH</ENAMEX> (sodium
hydroxide, commonly known as caustic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda</ENAMEX> or lye)
and NaNO3 (sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitrate</ENAMEX>, sometimes called <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chile</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saltpeter</ENAMEX>).

            A common substitute for sodium when the latter
is contraindicated (e.g. for heart conditions) is potassium
(from potash), whose valence is also 1 and
whose symbol is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>, from late <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> kalium , a word of
dubious etymology.  (For what it's worth, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> kalia
means birdhouse, little shed, wooden shrineâ€”
such as would cover an outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divinty</ENAMEX>'s statue.)
Unlike sodium, free potassium reacts violently with
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, liberating gaseous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen</ENAMEX> ; but like sodium, potassium is rarely
free and much more apt to be encountered in compounds.  Potassium iodide
can be used at dinner as a salt substitute; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morton</ENAMEX> salt
includes significant amounts of it as an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>
because iodine (like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorine</ENAMEX>, a valence-1 halogen
and a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> in its natural state) is necessary to the
proper functioning of our thyroid glands.

            Potassium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> (KCl), on the other hand,
can be made to react with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chile</ENAMEX> saltpeter (see
above) to produce true saltpeter: potassium nitrate
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">KNO3</NUMEX>), an essential ingredient of gunpowder,
whose other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur</ENAMEX> and carbon;
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> can be combined to explosive effect in as
simple proportions by weight as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, and 3</ENAMEX> respectively.
(Do not try this at home.)

            There is also a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> called wall saltpeter
because it can leach out of the mortar between the
bricks of damp walls: calcium nitrate (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CaNO3</NUMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calcium</ENAMEX> has a valence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, so it can substitute in
many a molecule for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> atoms of potassium, sodium,
or hydrogen, or some combination of them; its
name derives from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> calx , which means both
limeâ€”the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX>, not the fruitâ€”and heelbone.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lime</ENAMEX> and bones is not accidental:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limestone</ENAMEX> (calcium carbonate, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaCO3</TIMEX>) is nothing
but the fossilized skeletons of tiny sea <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calcium</ENAMEX> is the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredient</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>; when
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> wrote, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Tempest</ENAMEX> , that Of his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bones</ENAMEX> are coral made, he stated a truer fact of
nature than he may have known.  Other ubiquitous
calcium compounds include gypsumâ€”calcium sulfate
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaSO4</TIMEX>;), which is what sheetrock is made ofâ€”
and the active binding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in cement, quicklimeâ€”
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Calcium oxide</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaO</ENAMEX>), produced by cooking limestone
in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lime kiln</ENAMEX> (the primitive version, a lime rick
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">â€”compare hay</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rick</ENAMEX> , a variant of haystack â€”was a
heap of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> and a fire kept going
inside itâ€”whence the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX>
by which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">doggerel</ENAMEX> verse-form is called as well ).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quicklime</ENAMEX> is quick (that is, alive, as in the quick
and the dead) because it is anhydrous (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unwatered</ENAMEX>) and soaks up water with a vengeance to
make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">slaked lime</ENAMEX> (calcium hydroxide, Ca(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OH</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaO</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">H2O</NUMEX>), which is what makes quicklime so
useful as the binding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in mortar, cement, and
concrete.

            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> bear macaronic labels: one
which has a name from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> but a symbol from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin</ENAMEX> is antimony (refined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 900</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.E.</ENAMEX> and
used, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</TIMEX>, as a powerful precursor
to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ex-Lax</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> swallowed it as a pill
which was collected at the other end and weighed,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> being charged for the difference.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antimony</ENAMEX> is so called from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> antimonos , against
single(ness) owing to its readiness to react with
other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>, but its chemical symbol is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sb</ENAMEX>, from
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> stibium , the name of a cosmetic and medicinal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">powder</ENAMEX> (antimony sulfide) used by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> as
a hair blackener for their eyebrows, and in ophthalmology
(of which there were many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Etruscan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>,
thanks in part to the unhealthy swamps of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuscan</ENAMEX> hinterlands) as an eye <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ointment</ENAMEX>.
Another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX>, tinâ€”for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenicians</ENAMEX> used
to sail as far from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyre</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sidon</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mines</ENAMEX> on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cornwall</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly three millennia</TIMEX> agoâ€”bears
a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> short for another metallic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX>:
Sn, for stannum , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX>-era amalgam of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> and
lead.  (The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romans</ENAMEX> called tin plumbum album â€”
white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lead</ENAMEX>.)

            Most of the elements discovered in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> exuberant
wave of Enlightenment chemistry bear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">abbreviations</ENAMEX> close to their actual names: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ni</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nickel</ENAMEX>, first identified in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1751</TIMEX> (an abbreviation of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German Kupfernickel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX>-demon, so called
because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners</ENAMEX> first noticed it as a stubborn adulterant
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper ore</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al</ENAMEX> for aluminumâ€”spelled alumin i um
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Commonwealth</ENAMEX> nations
(named in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1825</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> alumen , astringent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX>),
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX> for cobalt (isolated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1735</TIMEX>; the name is
a variant of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> Kobold , a kind of imp).  But
there are a few curve balls here as well, such as tungsten
(from tung sten , <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX> for heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>), first
discovered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1783</TIMEX>, whose symbol is W, short for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wolfram</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wolf-soot)â</ENAMEX>€”the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> name for tungsten
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxide</ENAMEX>.

            

            Tungsten was first discovered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1819</TIMEX>, along with tellurium (with the symbol
Te, it comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> tellus , another word for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">terra</ENAMEX> , both meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>; compare the consonant
shift between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> puer , boy, and puella, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>) in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huntington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, in a bismuth <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>.  (It was
once thought that bismuth <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€”symbol Biâ€”was a</ENAMEX>
Germanic corruption of weisse <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masse</ENAMEX> , white mass.
However, it now appears to have a far more complicated
history: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bismut</ENAMEX> came from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Latin</ENAMEX>
bismutum , itself altered from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">medieval Latin</ENAMEX> vismutum ,
from obsolete <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> Wismut , itself a compound
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wise</ENAMEX>- , meadow, plus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mut</ENAMEX> , mine claim.  If
this seems far-fetched, consider that a major
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> polish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> began when a Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> extricated one of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cows</ENAMEX>
from a slough in a wet part of a field and was tipped
off by the whitish mud clinging to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>'s feet to
the presence of what proved to be a surprisingly
large deposit of calcium-rich diatomaceous earth.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mines</ENAMEX> do grow in meadows.)

            Apart from identifying the elements, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemists</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 19th century</TIMEX> were
most interested in quantifying them.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JÃ¶</ENAMEX>;ns Jakob
Berzelius, who discovered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">selenium</ENAMEX> (from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
selene , moon) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1818</TIMEX> and named silicon (from
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> silex , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">flint</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1824</TIMEX>, compiled the first systematic
table of the elements in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1828</TIMEX>, arranged according
to units of atomic weight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> twelfth of the heft
of the commonest isotope of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX>.  (The heavier
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon-14â€”C14</ENAMEX> for shortâ€”is radioactive, with a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-lifeâ€”the amount of time it takes half the
radioactive atoms to throw off particles and decay to
their non-radioactive isotopeâ€”reckoned in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX>
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, once the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> is captured in a living
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> such as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.  This permits a means of reasonably
accurate dating which has been a boon to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archeologists</ENAMEX>.)

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Four decades later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dmitri Mendeleev</ENAMEX> systematized
the table to show stacks of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> with similar
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">properties</ENAMEX> (e.g. the interchangeability of the
numbers of hydrogen, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lithium</ENAMEX>, sodium and potassium
atoms in molecules such as sulfates and hydroxides:
The sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">atom</ENAMEX> in lyeâ€”NaOHâ€”could just
as well be replaced by a second <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen</ENAMEX>, making
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen hydroxideâ€”HOH</ENAMEX>, better known as
H2O, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>).  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mendeleev's insight</ENAMEX> was so valuable
that when radioactive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> began being synthesized
in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX>, he got one
named after him: Mendeleviumâ€”note the dropping
of the final <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">e!â€”the 101st</ENAMEX> element (symbol
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Md</ENAMEX>), first synthesized in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</TIMEX>.

            Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> with eponymous atoms include
the discoverers of radium, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie Curie</ENAMEX>
(element <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">96</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Curium</ENAMEX>, symbol <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cm</ENAMEX>, discovered in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest O. Lawrence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrence Berkeley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lawrence Livermore</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>
(element <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lawrencium</ENAMEX>, symbol <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lr</ENAMEX>, synthesized
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX>), and, of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Einstein</ENAMEX>
(element <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">99</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Einsteinium</ENAMEX>, symbol <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es</ENAMEX>, created in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1952</TIMEX>)â€”the only instance of an atom named after
someone still living at the time of its discovery.  (He
died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</TIMEX>.)

            Place names and celestial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> have been a
fruitful source of names for both natural and synthetic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>.  For the outer planets, there are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uranium</ENAMEX>, neptunium, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plutonium</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cerium</ENAMEX> is
named for the asteroid <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ceres</ENAMEX>, both having been discovered
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">same year</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1801</TIMEX>).  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX> commemoratives
include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americium, Germanium</ENAMEX>, Polonium
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Francium</ENAMEX>; ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> likewise gets a nod in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gallium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX>), the only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX> that melts in your
hand, not in your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> (unless you have a very
warm <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>)â€”named both for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaul</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin Gallia</ENAMEX>,
that place which, thanks to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julius Caesar</ENAMEX>'s memoir
of its subjugation by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX>, every schoolchild
used to know was divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> parts) and, in a
gesture of unusual levity, as a pun on the name of its
discoverer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul-Ã‰mile Lecoq de Boisbaudran</ENAMEX>.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> coq and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> gallus both mean the same
thing: rooster.)

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">place</ENAMEX> has the distinction of having no fewer
than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> atoms named after it, an embarrassment
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nomenclature</ENAMEX> arising from what was originally
thought to be one element turning out on closer
inspection to be several.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Gustav Mosander</ENAMEX>
found a new element in a geological sample from
Ytterby, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX>, a town just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few miles</NUMEX> north of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GÃ¶teborg</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX> terminus for the ferry from
Frederikshavn, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX>.  Do not confuse this with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ytterby n</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX>, which is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1000 kilometers</NUMEX> to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">north</ENAMEX>, on the gulf of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bothnia</ENAMEX>).  Naturally enough,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosander</ENAMEX> named the new element <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ytterbium</ENAMEX>, after
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.

            One can well imagine his surprise when the
new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">atom</ENAMEX> turned out to be plural.  To make the best
of a bad situation, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> elements
got names from pieces of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erbium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Er</ENAMEX>) and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terbium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tb</ENAMEX>).  Complicating matters even more, in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1907</TIMEX> another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Urbain</ENAMEX>, discovered
that the remaining element was actually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.  The
new one got called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ytterbium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yb</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosander</ENAMEX>'s
original find got the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yttrium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>).  Synthetic
yttrium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum garnets</ENAMEX> (YAGs) are favored by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jewelers</ENAMEX> and their public because the high refractive
index of the gem approaches that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamond</ENAMEX>,
at a fraction of the cost.

            Revelation is not seal'd:  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">New elements</ENAMEX> are
being discovered to this day.  As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society for Heavy Ion Research</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Darmstadt</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, had gotten up to element 112.  These new
radioactive atoms are remarkably ephemeral, often
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decaying</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">millionths of a second</TIMEX> into lighter elements
by casting off subatomic particles, their fleeting
lives documented only by vapor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX>.

            Still, they enjoy a brief existence of a sort, and
names for them, honoring physicists and the locations
of their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>, are already queued up
awaiting approval by the scientific community at
large: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rutherfordium</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#104</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Rutherford</ENAMEX>),
Dubnium for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#105</NUMEX> (after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dubna</ENAMEX>),
Seaborgium for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#106</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Seaborg</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bohrium</ENAMEX> for
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#107</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niels Bohr</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hassium</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#108</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hesse</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Darmstadt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> is
located) andâ€”the first element to be named solely
for a womanâ€”Meitnerium for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#109</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lise Meitner</ENAMEX>).

            It is a sobering thought, then, to consider that
virtually all of the elements <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">above #2</NUMEX> (helium, the
fusion product of the hydrogen that makes up the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stars</ENAMEX>, our sun included) are the result of the catastrophic
blowing apart of prior suns, and that our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">earth</ENAMEX> and everything else in our own solar system
are mere cosmic hand-me-downs from someone
else's supernova.  In this light the history of the universe
according to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taoist</ENAMEX> thought can be either
depressing or exhilarating, depending on one's point
of view; at any rate it seems true enough as far as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Picture</ENAMEX> goes: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First</ENAMEX> there was nothing.  Then
there was something.  Then there was hydrogen.
Then there was dirty hydrogen.

influenced a whole generation of budding
cabaret-song <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composers</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of this

Originally issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago University Press</ENAMEX> as one
offering in a set of works, edited by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mathematician</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolf Carnap</ENAMEX>, called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundations of the Unity</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuhn</ENAMEX>'s blockbuster deconstruction of
normal scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX> had the effect among
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of torpedoing the very idea that that
there was any unity of science.  That it was the final
volume in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">series</ENAMEX> may, however, have been entirely
coincidental.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carnap</ENAMEX> died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuhn</ENAMEX> this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past year</TIMEX>.
            The formula for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfuric acid</ENAMEX> will never be forgotten
by anyone who learned in junior high school
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variant</ENAMEX> of the following epitaph:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny</ENAMEX> drank the beaker dry;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny</ENAMEX> is no more:
For what he thought was H2O

            As the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Primo Levi</ENAMEX> dramatically
was reminded when a flask blew up in which he was
trying to refine benzene under wartime-scarcity conditions,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of several remarkable escapes from death
recounted in his collection of autobiographical essays
published as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">The Periodic Table</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schocken</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">York: 1984</ENAMEX>).
            Here is the limerick about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Ward Beecher</ENAMEX>,
promised in the opening paragraph:
A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">great</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Congregational Preacher</ENAMEX>
Once said to a hen, You sweet creature!
The hen, just for that,
Laid an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> in his hat,
And thus did the hen reward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beecher</ENAMEX>.
It has been argued, but not definitively proven,
that this is a veiled reference to the scandalous affair
between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beecher</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Tilton</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of
his parish and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brookhiser</ENAMEX>'s article <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Happy Medium in the New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York Times Book Review</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 29, 1998</TIMEX>.
            An alternate derivation, spurious but appealing,
was proposed to us while this article was in preparation,
in a letter (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8/20/1998</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Col.</ENAMEX>  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Holan</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAF</ENAMEX> (retd.): The symbol for tungsten is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> because
it is Weird.
            I am indebted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Goldfrank</ENAMEX>, my coauthor
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Basin Bicycle Book</ENAMEX> , for bringing
to my attention this tidy cosmological synopsis (personal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1970s</TIMEX>).
            Loose ends: (a) While we're on the subject, or at
least next door to itâ€”or at any rate, before we leave
its vicinityâ€”let this be said for the record: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nowhere</ENAMEX>
in the works of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Conan Doyle</ENAMEX> does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch-</ENAMEX>sleuth
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherlock Holmes</ENAMEX> ever actually say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elementary</ENAMEX>, my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dear Watson</ENAMEX>.

(b) The term element itself, while unquestionably
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latinâ€”Cicero</ENAMEX> gives it as a gloss for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> stoicheion,
series ( stoichiometry is the calculation of
relative quantities of reagents and their end-products
in a chemical reaction)â€”is of obscure derivation.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernout</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meillet</ENAMEX>, in their delightful Dictionnaire
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ã©tymologique de la</ENAMEX> langue latine , urbanely review several
rather far-fetched possibilities including
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LMNâ</ENAMEX>€”well, it is a seriesâ€”and elephas (<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX>),
but conclude with a shrug of their shoulders and a
suggestion that the word might have come from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etruscan</ENAMEX>.  Another word whose origin is shrouded in
the mists of antiquityâ€”like the swamps of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etruria</ENAMEX>, a
notoriously foggy place.

            You'll find some familiar voices as well as some

            One thing you may have already noticed is that
we are a little more wired than before, and it's not
just due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>.  I can be emailed at
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>@verbatimmag.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> , and our shiny new website,
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">verbatimmag</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> , has been duly submitted
to all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">spiders</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">indexers</ENAMEX>, and 'bots that make
up the major Internet search indexes.  Eventually, we
plan to make back issues available (and searchable!)
online for your researching pleasure.

            Many of you have written and asked for details
about the sale.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> has been sold to Dr.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the questions we asked on our survey was
if you would be interested in a Best of collection of
past articles.  Many, many of you were, so I am asking
you to send in your votes for what articles were
best from the past <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> volumes.  Send
them to the address on the masthead or to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>@verbatimmag.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>.
Please include the title,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, volume, and issue number if you know them,
or as much information as you can!

            Kudos to the sharp-eyed survey <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">answerers</ENAMEX> who
caught the typo in the last line of the survey: The
classic you instead of your.  And thanks to those of
you who wrote in about the double possessive in the
salutation of the letters.  To lift from the latest
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fowler</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Usage</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.W. Burchfield</ENAMEX>,

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">idiomatic</ENAMEX>, but a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Museum's</ENAMEX> is
not.  So the idiomaticity of the phrase we used in
our letter to former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> (Dear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friends of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM'S</ENAMEX>) all depends on whether you feel
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> is more like your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>

            A few reassurances: some of you have written to
express your hopes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> will not
become clogged with ads.  According to our nonprofit
application, we can only accept ads for products,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, or services related to our mission,
which absolutely rules out ads for personal watercraft,
financial services, and smelly perfume inserts.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> last plea: don't you know someone who
would like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>?  Think of us when making
out your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holiday</TIMEX> lists.  Due to the marvelous response
from former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX>, the special <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25/year</NUMEX> rate in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North America</ENAMEX> (Â<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">¥18</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.K</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US $30</NUMEX> everywhere
else) will be good for the foreseeable future.  Write,
call, or email by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1</TIMEX> and your gift will start
with the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> issue.  Of course, we'll send a card.

            I trust that our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> will not hesitate to make
their feelings known about our reincarnationâ€”keep

Regional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> (familiarly known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARE</ENAMEX>), I'd
like to take the opportunity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>'s rebirth
to bring you all up to date.  First, let me answer the
most frequently asked question, How is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cassidy</ENAMEX> doing?  I'm delighted to say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederic G.</ENAMEX>
Cassidy, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARE</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Editor</ENAMEX> as well as the founder
of and inspiration behind the project, shows few signs
of slowing down as he approaches his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX>-first
birthday.  His recent return from a trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jamaica</ENAMEX>
(where he was born and later did the research for his
books on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jamaican English</ENAMEX>) and his imminent departure
for a conference on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean Linguistics</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucia</ENAMEX> should convince you of his good health!

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> most frequently asked question,
When will Volume <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX> be available?  is more difficult
to answer.  Before I try, let me give a quick synopsis of
the project for those who aren't already familiar with it.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of American Regional English</ENAMEX> is a
reference tool unlike any other.  Its aim is not to prescribe
how <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> should speak, or even to
describe the language we use as cultivated speakers
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>.  Instead, it tries to document the varieties
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> that are not found throughout the countryâ€”those
words, pronunciations, and phrases that
vary from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> to another, that are learned at
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> rather than at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, or that are part of our oral
rather than our written culture.  Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is remarkably homogeneous given the
tremendous size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, there are still many
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of differences that characterize the various
dialect regions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.  It is these differences
that DARE records.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX> is based both on face-to-face
interviews carried out in all fifty states <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1965</TIMEX>
and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>, and on an extensive collection of written
materials (diaries, letters, novels, histories, biographies,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>, and government documents) that
cover our history from the colonial period up to the
present.  These materials are cited in individual
entries to illustrate how words have been used from
the seventeenth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> through the end of the twentieth.
The entries also include pronunciations (if they
vary regionally or differ from what would be expected),
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variant</ENAMEX> forms, etymologies (if DARE can add to
what is already known about a word's history), and
statements about regional and social distributions of
words and forms.

            A feature unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARE</ENAMEX> is its inclusion in the
text of the dictionary of numerous maps that show
where words were found in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,002</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>
investigated during the fieldwork.  The maps are distorted
to reflect population density rather than geographic
area (giving a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> in small, but densely
populated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> as much space as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> in
large, but sparsely populated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX>).  Though the
maps are disconcerting at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance, one easily
learns to translate the state boundaries and make
sense of the regional patterns.

            Volume I, including extensive introductory matter
and the letters A-C, was published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX> (to the
acclaim of scholarly and lay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> alike, I'm
pleased to say).  It had gone into a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> printing within
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> of publication.  Volume <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-H) came out in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volume III</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-O</ENAMEX>) appeared in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>.  Volume
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> will include P through the middle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> (we hate to
divide a letter in the middle, but you all know how big
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> is).  And Volume V will take us through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Z.</ENAMEX>

            To give you a sample of what's to come, let me
mention a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> headwords from
Volume IVâ€”chosen simply because I like them.  (If
they are strange to you, see below for their meanings.)
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>'s take us from pandowdy to pompey to pudjicky;
the Q's offer qualmish, quick start, and quiddle;
in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> we find ramstugious, redd up, robin snow, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rumpelkammer</ENAMEX>; and S yields saluggi, say-so, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">smearcase</ENAMEX>.  Not to be outdone in creativity, the natural
science entries offer pollynose, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">prickly pig</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">toes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quaker</ENAMEX> bonnet, railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Annie</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sac-a-lait</ENAMEX>,
among many, many others.

            As you can see from this sample, we are moving
steadily along through the alphabet.  Our original
hope had been to publish Volume <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, with
Volume V coming out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</TIMEX>.  That schedule, however,
was contingent on our maintaining our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> level
of funding, which has become increasingly difficult,
and, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX>, impossible.  In fact, our
financial woes necessitated a staff reduction <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</TIMEX>,
and it looks as if Volume <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> will not be ready
before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>.

            Although the project is located on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Wisconsin</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>
can provide very limited financial support.  Our funding
has come primarily from grants from the National
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Endowment for the Humanities</ENAMEX>, matched by gifts
from numerous foundations and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.  While
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</ENAMEX> was for many
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years our</TIMEX> largest source of private funds, we have
also received assistance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brittingham Fund</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation</ENAMEX>, the Evjue
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hillsdale Fund, Inc.</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grace Jones</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Richardson Trust</ENAMEX>, among others.

            After helping DARE for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly twenty years</TIMEX>
(despite its usual limit of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mellon</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX> has had to move on to other worthy projects.
So, we must find other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> who can help us
see that this project reaches the only reasonable conclusion
for a dictionaryâ€”the letter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Z.</ENAMEX>  The single
bright spot in our funding picture is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean of</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College of Letters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX> here at the UWMadison
has provided DARE with a Development
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Specialist</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Simon</ENAMEX> has just
joined our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, and will be devoting his considerable
energies to finding new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of funding for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARE</ENAMEX>.  Although we hope that the National
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Endowment for the Humanities</ENAMEX> will continue to provide
us with some support, it is clear that the future
of the project depends largely on private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">philanthropy</ENAMEX>.
We all know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who
might be able to help.  If you can be part of our support
network, or know someone else who can, won't
you give <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> a call?  He can be reached at (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">608</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">265-9836</ENAMEX>.  Or drop him a note at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6125</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen White</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. Park St.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53706</NUMEX>; or send
him an e-mail at davidsimon@facstaff.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wisc</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu</ENAMEX>.  (While
you're on line, take a look at our website, at

invite you to join in our rallying cryâ€”On to Z!

            In case you didn't recognize those Volume <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>

            Exploring the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lexicon</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natives of North America</ENAMEX>



            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX>, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of American</ENAMEX>
Regional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARE</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> campus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederic G. Cassidy</ENAMEX> assembled
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> group of dialect fieldworkers he would
send out in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Word Wagons</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vans</ENAMEX> converted to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">campers</ENAMEX>) to collect regional words from far-flung
reaches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.  I was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>; the others
were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Clark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley J. Cook</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patt Van Dyke</ENAMEX>.
We went through a week of orientation and instruction,
getting to know the office <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and operations,
having our driving and phonetic transcription skills
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">checked</ENAMEX>, and learning to use our camping and
recording equipment.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bibliographer Goldye Mohr</ENAMEX>
had identified the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> we were to visit.  It
was up to us to choose an efficient itinerary and
locate informantsâ€”as many as needed, but ideally
just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in each placeâ€”to answer the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">253</NUMEX>-page
DARE questionnaire (QR).  We were advised to
begin each project by notifying the county <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sheriff</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX>, or other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, and to ask them for
leads to good informants.

            The ideal informant (INF) was a native and lifelong
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> from an old local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, someone without
much exposure to the outside world, who spoke
regularly and familiarly with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community members</ENAMEX> of
all social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ranks</ENAMEX> and occupations, who could remember
precisely how all of them talked about their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX>, domestic, economic, and natural environments,
and who would donate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty hours</TIMEX> of
free time to transmit all this information.

            The ideal fieldworker (FW) was a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listener</ENAMEX>
with at least a little linguistic training and a lot of
SprachgefÃ¼hl who knew as much about the world in
general as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INF</ENAMEX> knew about the local part of it.
First, though, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FW</ENAMEX> had to possess a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> for fitting
in, so as to make such an impression of integrity
and worth on local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> that they arranged an
introduction at once to the ideal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INF</ENAMEX>.  Once the
interview began, this ideal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FW</ENAMEX> would seem as familiar
as an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, so that the INF always spoke in
everyday terms instead of bookish formal ones.

            Like all ideals, these remained abstract, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARE</ENAMEX> had to make do with actual human beings and
their limitations.  Judging by the quality of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,002</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QRs</ENAMEX> archived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX>, weâ€”INFs and FWs
alikeâ€”must have compensated for our limitations
pretty well.

            Of my own limitations, the one I had to compensate
for most was my ignorance of city life.  I asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jim</ENAMEX>
Hartman, the fieldwork <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX>, not to send me
on any more urban expeditions than necessary.
However, since I was the sole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">FW</ENAMEX> assigned to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louisiana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> was necessary.  In fact, it was
necessary twice, because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QRs</ENAMEX> were allocated in
the metropolitan area.  To increase coverage, I divided
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> between a white suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housewife</ENAMEX> and a
black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardener</ENAMEX> from downtown.  For the other I went
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish Channel</ENAMEX>, a working-class neighborhood.
This was the environment I was most ill-suited for.

            I knew how to act in some places.  Growing up in
the rural <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ozarks</ENAMEX>, I learned early that good country
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> expect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to sit and visit a spell before
bringing up their business.  From dealing with academic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">administrators</ENAMEX>, I knew to come straight to the point
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personages</ENAMEX> who sit behind large desks and have
their time allocated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretaries</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX>, had taught me that white men
like me always had to state their business clearly when
looking for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> of a black neighborhood; otherwise
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> would assume they were up to no
good and pretend not to know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>.  Because my
city experience was largely limited to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> enclaves,
however, nothing prepared me for establishing turf in
a working-class urban neighborhood.

            My difficulty was exacerbated by the setting
where I was introduced by a city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">councilman</ENAMEX>: a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parasol's</ENAMEX>, which played a central role in the social and
cultural life of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish Channel</ENAMEX>.  I could find no one
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INF</ENAMEX> who would withdraw to a private spot for a quiet
interview; I just had to show up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every afternoon</TIMEX> and
interview whichever authentic old-time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish Channel</ENAMEX>
male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> came in and agreed to talk there in the
bar.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> stayed on the restaurant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side</ENAMEX>, and I was
given to understand it would be presumptuous of me
to try to interview them.  On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar side</ENAMEX>, I was
expected to buy rounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> when my turn came
up and to drink the beer served to me when others
bought rounds.  The regulars came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost every day</TIMEX>
to play out roles (jokester, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">misanthrope</ENAMEX>, goosey <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>,
smiley <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>, gourmand, and others) in an ongoing plotless
improvisational drama.

            It was a fun-loving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and I would have had as
much fun as anybody if I had not had work to do, but
keeping the QR going required continual exercise of
the will.  Normally, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INF</ENAMEX>, once we established
a working relationship, my only strain came from
making the questions understood and making sure I
understood the answers.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parasol's</ENAMEX>, though, I had to
struggle <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX> to shape and defend my identity
because it never did settle down to a single role that
every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> could play to.  To some I was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> writing
a book. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> always greeted me with,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>! <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>! Another fixated on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX>
and repeatedly tried to start friendly arguments about
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Green Bay Packers</ENAMEX>.

            A quintessential incident: <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron</ENAMEX> new
to me came in, noticed me asking questions, and
began asking some himself.  I explained cordially what
I was doing and who I worked for.

            He said, Oh, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yankee</ENAMEX>, hunh?

            Still cordially, I said, No, I'm not a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yankee</ENAMEX>.  I just
work for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Wisconsin</ENAMEX>.  I was born and
raised in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>.  He sparred with me about what
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX> would be good for and called me a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankee</ENAMEX> again.  This time, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> for show and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> in real
anger, I stood up, slammed my fist to the table, and
shouted, God damn it, I'm not a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yankee</ENAMEX>!

            There were several of us at the table, and every-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>'s
beer turned over.  I thought, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Uh-oh</ENAMEX>, now I've
got a fight on my hands.  Sensing I had to show some
spunk, but unable to guage it right, I had almost
shown too much.  He said, Take it easy.  I'm not trying
to start nothing.  He didn't back off for long; after I
had bought more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>, he came after me again about
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>.  I think, he said, it's a lot of bullshit.

            I answered much the way I had answered more
delicately phrased objections in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> and north
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louisiana</ENAMEX>: I told how, for example, a fisherman would
be able to check the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX> if he caught a mudfish
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> and wanted to find out what the real
name of it was.  He could find that the mudfish is
called bowfin in textbooks, that in south <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">north Louisiana</ENAMEX> it is written grindle or grinnel but
always pronounced [` <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grinl</ENAMEX> ]; that in south <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> it
is called <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">green cypress trout</ENAMEX>, grinnel , and choupique ,
which in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is pronounced [Å¡]; that in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northwest Florida</ENAMEX> the word grindle is sometimes pronounced
[`<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grindl</ENAMEX>].  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> could find similar interesting
bits of information about every aspect of daily
life.

            Such explanations had always worked before but
here I had gauged wrong again.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> farther
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">north</ENAMEX> had all been earnest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestants</ENAMEX> with a utilitarian
outlook.  This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> resided in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> neighborhood
whose cultural values were epitomized by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parades</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mardi Gras</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Patrick</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celebrants</ENAMEX> began planning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>'s
parade <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>'s was over.  I should
have known that these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interests</ENAMEX> did not point to a
utilitarian turn of mind.

            Yeah, he said, but I still think it's a lot of bullshit.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years later</TIMEX> I would present a symposium
paper titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Scholarship as Play</ENAMEX>, saying academic
pursuits manifest the human tendency to extend the
learning activity of play all the way through adulthood
instead of abandoning it after adolescence, as
most other mammals do.  Even in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>, though, I
had long realizedâ€”without thinking the matter
through so thoroughly as I did for the paperâ€”that
academic study is not serious in the same sense that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">farming</ENAMEX>, mining, weaving, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-rearing are.  I
had seldom said so openly, but this began to seem
like a good time.  I grinned and looked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in the
eye and said, To tell you the truth, I think it's a lot
of bullshit myself.  But I really enjoy doing it.

            He looked blank for a moment and then grinned
back and said, You know something?  I kinda like
you!

            Fitting in can have its drawbacks.  Another time,
I was able to keep an informant only because I was
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsider</ENAMEX>; she realized she should make allowances
for my ignorance.  That story is worth telling, if only
for the word she made allowances for.

            In introducing myself and DARE to a prospective
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INF</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cameron</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA</ENAMEX>, I gave examples of what I
had learned.  Among others, I mentioned the names
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caouane</ENAMEX> [\?\ka\?\wÎµn] or [\?\ka\?\wÃ¦n], <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtle</ENAMEX>; gros-bec
[\?\gro(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX>),<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bÎµk</ENAMEX>], <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night heron</TIMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bec-scie</ENAMEX> [\?\bÎµk\?\si],
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">merganser</ENAMEX>.  She agreed to work with me, but the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX> she warned me not to say one of the words
I had used <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day before</TIMEX> because it was a dirty word
and I would get in trouble for it.  At the time I could
not recall any words I had said.  I asked, Which
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>?

            She cast down her eyes and said, I can't tell
you.

            For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> or two I was almost afraid to speak at
all, until I narrowed down to the words mentioned
above.  Just before leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cameron</ENAMEX>, I made an educated
guess and asked my INF if it was the word for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtle</ENAMEX> that was so bad.  She said it was.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hartman</ENAMEX> had told me to be on the lookout for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">southeastern turtle</ENAMEX> name cooter , with the slang
meaning pudendum.  If that was what caouane
meant, we had something.  I pursued the investigation
in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, where verbal taboos are often relaxed.
There was one male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> inside, talking with
the proprietress.  After I had circumlocuted a while
to avoid offense to her, she and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> agreed
slyly they knew what word I meant.  I learned over to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, cupped my ear, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intoned</ENAMEX> dramatically,
Tell me.

            It's caouane [\?\ka\?\wÃ¦n], he said, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
it means pussy.  I remained outwardly calm, but I
could have jumped up and down and shouted.

            I wrote to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cassidy</ENAMEX> expressing puzzlement.  I
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">remembered Thomas Pyles</ENAMEX> pointing out in class
once that animal metaphors for this body part name
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cute</ENAMEX>, furry <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>: pussy, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">beaver</ENAMEX>, squirrel, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX>,
cony, and (in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>) lapin .  Nothing about a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtle</ENAMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cuddlesome</ENAMEX>; it does not fit the pattern.  Cassidy
offered an intriguing explanation:  the metaphor
probably originated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> folklore, which has
it that sea <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX> (the referent for caouane in standard
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> dictionaries) copulate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a hundred</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> at a time.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> the name was transferred
to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">freshwater turtle</ENAMEX> with far more modest
size and amatory tenacity, but the metaphor persisted.
It pays tribute not to cuteness but to sexual
power.  It venerates venery.

            I would never have learned all this if my INF
had not proffered the courtesy owed to an ignorant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsider</ENAMEX>.

            
               [<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Textual</ENAMEX> note] The anecdotes recounted here are
retellings of my fieldwork <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> entries dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 5</TIMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mar. 7</ENAMEX>, [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>].  The original volumes are in my
possession; photocopies are archived at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARE</ENAMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ups and Downs</ENAMEX>



            Explaining <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">idioms</ENAMEX> is tough enough, but
how do you account for the seemingly contradictory
ones?  I was in a taxi with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine,
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> was cutting through traffic like a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">speedboat</ENAMEX> through a docking area.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddy</ENAMEX>!  I
rapped on the divider-glass.  Slow up a little, will
you?

            This tactic actually worked.  But when we arrived
at our destination and were safely on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX>, my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend murmured</ENAMEX>, Excuse me, but isn't the proper
expression slow down?

            Well, yes, I began.  I mean, no.  It's both, really.

            My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> cocked his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> as if to say, You
Occidentals!  I could have said something about
Japaneseâ€”how hai sometimes means yes and sometimes
means no â€”but decided not to pursue it further.
Still, it got me thinking.

            Take a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> doing a brisk business: when
closing time comes around, does it shut up for the
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, or shut down ?  When your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> picked
all those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cherries</ENAMEX>, did she put up preserves or put
down canned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cherries</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX>?  For proper
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directions</ENAMEX>, do you go down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mile</NUMEX> before
turning right, or up the road?
            

            These may seem like imponderables, but we can
tease out a few differences.  <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> of all, when an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> shuts up, it simply closes, but when it
shuts down, it ceases activity.  If this sounds like too
nice a distinction, consider common usage: <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>
shut down rather than shutting up; conversely, your
rude <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> may ask you to shut up, not shut down.
Similarly, putting up <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> often involves sealing it in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jars</ENAMEX> later stored on shelves, as opposed to putting
down a good supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hay</ENAMEX> for your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">livestock</ENAMEX>.  As for
which way to go on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, up is either literally up a
rise, due north, or just the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> is pointing.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English</ENAMEX> has other such ups and downs: ripping up
a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> versus ripping down the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, for
instance, or the hearty  Drink it down!  instead of
 Drink it up!   If usage is a sundial, the shade of
meaning alters its angle slightly here.  Ripping up anything
means destroying it, often by severing the connective
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, from ripping up floorboards to ripping
up a draft card.  To rip down a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, on the other
hand, is to raze it.  Break up and break down , like tear
up and tear down , and cut up and cut down , work
comparably.  Idiomatic drinking, like drinking itself, is
a little fuzzier, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> senses coexist: having your
comrades clap you on the back as you tilt up your beer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stein</ENAMEX>, or else downing a draught of nasty medicine
because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> tells you to.

            Of course, most ups and downs function as simple
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">opposites</ENAMEX>, as in uptown versus downtown .  To look up
a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> should be in the opposite direction of to look
down it, just as to look up to a person you admire is
the course of to look down on an inferior.  But what
about expressions that split unevenly?  To sit up is at
most a slant-opposite of to sit down , since sitting
down means to sit, whereas sitting up means that you
were already sitting but are now improving your posture.
(A sit-up , with a hyphen, exercises your abdominal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">muscles</ENAMEX>, but a sit-down strike tends to exercise
the tempers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>.)  And if you happen to
be sitting already, then you can stand up , but if you're
asked to stand down , then you're still standing after
that, just not on the stage or dais.  Of course, if you're
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>, to stand down is to be at ease, no
longer at attention.

            Other uneven splits include hurry up , or to hasten,
versus hurry down , to hie yourself in a particular
direction.  You dig up buried treasure but dig down on
your energy reserves to finish that race.  You can be
called up for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> duty, but in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> to be called
down from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> is a bit of a disgrace, similar to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">expulsion</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.  Why are these ups and
downs not polar opposites?  If it comes to that, even
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptown</ENAMEX> and downtown aren't quite equivalent
because downtown in many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> is only a few
blocks.

            After a while, you can see a difference emerging.
Get up and get down , for instance, could be exact
antonyms, except that each has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> secondary
meaning that leads away from the original
paired meanings.  Get up may mean to pull yourself
up from the ground or to arise from bed.  In the nominal
sense, getup can mean a costume.  Get down ,
however, besides meaning to alight, also refers to
loosening up or having sex (from get down to it ), as in
the refrains of so many funk songs from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>'s.  To
throw up a parcel onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> may be the opposite
of to throw down that parcel onto the loading dock,
but clearly throw up has a regurgitative meaning that
throw down lacks.  This <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> meaning forms a slant-opposite.
Put up and put down , for instance, need not
refer just to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>: you can put up a guest (and put up
with him, as well) or put down a dying <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> (a milder
form of which applies to making babies sleep).  To
return to look up and look down , which seemed so
complementary in terms of location or regard: look up
has a tertiary meaning, as in looking up a word in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX>, that look down lacks.

            Thus, pipe up and pipe down are also slantopposites:
to speak out or to tune a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> versus to
lower your voice.  Keep up means to stay with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pace</ENAMEX>, whereas keep down is to oppress, or not to disgorge.
When you turn down , are you refusing an
offer or folding a bedsheet?  You can just as well turn
up that bedsheet, but when good luck turns up , that
introduces a new wrinkle.  Maybe one good turn
deserves its opposite.  As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D. H. Lawrence</ENAMEX> once
wrote, in an autobiographical poem called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Red-Herring</ENAMEX>:


My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> was a working man
and a collier was he,
at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six in the morning</TIMEX> they turned him down
and they turned him up for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>.
            

            The various senses of both turns show a lot about
the mining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> and what an efficient hell it was.

            In a similar vein: you run up a flag on the pole,
or run up a gross of a new product, or just run up a
whopping bill, but you run down a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX>, or a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">truck</ENAMEX> may run down a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>.  And the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rundown</ENAMEX> is inside information.  You can touch up a
paint job, but you touch down on an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airfield</ENAMEX>.  And
this is not to be confused with the touchdown that
all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> football <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> know.  You can stay up as
in keeping awake, or stay down as in hugging the
boxing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring mat</ENAMEX> for fear of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX>, yet to
stay up can be the opposite of to stay downâ€”it just
depends on the context.  (As a linguist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of
mine once <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wearily</ENAMEX> conceded,  Everything depends
on the context.)

            You can even apply some ingenious logic to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ups</ENAMEX> and downs: if you want to pack up more in an
already stuffed suitcase, better first pack down what
you have in there.  If you live it up too freely, you
may never live it down .  And crackdowns , done
while there is still time, may prevent future crackups .
Or a comeuppance may lead to a bringdown .

            Then there are the single <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">halves</NUMEX>.  You can cook
up a storm, but if you attempt to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>,
leave me out of your dinner invitations.  You can
catch up to your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rival</ENAMEX>, but who ever heard of catch
down ?  You can pick up a quart of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarket</ENAMEX>,
or some information by keeping your ears
open, but you generally don't pick down anything.
When you get too rowdy, you may be asked to quiet
down, never quite up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€”or, in reverse, clam up but
never clam down .  Oppositely, you may be asked to
'fess up or own up, but not in any other direction.
Facing a rough day ahead, you may want to rest up ,
but never rest down.  You can't butter down your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boss</ENAMEX>.  Your feelings may be pent up inside, not pent
down.  Scuffing your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoes</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pavement</ENAMEX> wears
down the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather</ENAMEX>, not up .  And how would you ever
hunker up?
            

            On the other hand, the lopsided quality of single
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">halves</ENAMEX> has caused a few reparations.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Nowadays,</ENAMEX>
the warm up for an athletic meet is paired after the
event with a warm down.  And the old query
What's up? has a streetwise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX>, What's
going down?  Just as nature is reputed to abhor a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vacuum</ENAMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can't abide asymmetry.

            Of course, there are other ins and outs to pursue
here, but in and out just introduce more
instances of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">slant</ENAMEX> usage, from read in and read out
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">toâ€”â€”</ENAMEX>( fill in or fill out the blank).

            Should I go off from here?  Or should I go on?
         
         
            Word Words



            We need some new words to describe words.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> already has several well known -onym words
(from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> onyma meaning name), such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synonym</ENAMEX> (same meaning), antonym (opposite meaning),
and homonym (same sound).

            Less well known is heteronym (same spelling, but
different sound, e.g., sow meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pig</ENAMEX> and sow
meaning planting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>).  Heteronyms are also
called homographs.
            

            Then there's pseudonym , (false name), eponym
(named for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwich</ENAMEX> after Lord
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandwich</ENAMEX>), and acronym (formed from the initial letters
or syllables of a group of words, e.g., snafu meaning
Situation <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Normal; All Fouled Up</ENAMEX> or laser meaning
Light <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amplification Stimulated Emissions</ENAMEX>
Radiation).

            It was that word acronym that started me thinking
about the need for more word words.  The word
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acronym</ENAMEX> is sometimes used for words formed from
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> letters of a group of words.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soho</ENAMEX> is the
area of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Manhattan SOuth of HOuston Street</ENAMEX>.  But is
Soho an acronym?  Yes, if we accept a definition that
includes the initial letters.  But can't we be more precise?
Let's leave acronym for a word formed from the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> letter of several words.  Then, we'll need a word
for a word formed from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> letters of words.
How about bicronym ?  That captures the initial-letter
sense of acronym but uses the combining form bi- signifying
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> (from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> bi- meaning twice or
having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>).

            What then should we do with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tribeca</ENAMEX> , the area of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> that is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">TRIangle BElow CAnal Street</ENAMEX>?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bicronym</ENAMEX> won't do, because we are using the first
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> letters of triangle.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tricronym</ENAMEX> won't do either,
because we are using only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> letters from
below and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Canal</ENAMEX> .  Perhaps the answer is polycronym ,
still capturing the initial-letter sense of acronym , but
using the combining form poly- signifying many
(from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> polus meaning much).

            These words, bicronym and polycronym , suggest
the need for still another word.  The words bicronym
and polycronym are formed by breaking up the combining
form acro- (from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> acros meaning
highest) into a- and cro- and combining bi- or poly-
with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">cro-</ENAMEX> .  A word thus formed by breaking up an
existing combining form, prefix, root, or suffix should
also have a name.  It could be fractonym, using the
coined combining form fracto- (from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> fractus,
the past participle of frangire meaning to break).

            Fractonyms existed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> before we had a
word for them.  A fairly well known example is prequel
the word that means an episode or a movie that portrays
events occurring before the events in the original
episode or movie.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prequel</ENAMEX> takes the word sequel
(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> sequela meaning what follows), breaks it into
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">se-</ENAMEX> and -quel , and then combines -quel with the prefix
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pre-.</ENAMEX>  Another current example of a fractonym is
threepeat , used to describe the feat of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> or individual
who wins an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> championship <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a row</TIMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Bulls</ENAMEX> were widely reported to
have achieved a threepeat in professional <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX>.
Repeat was broken into re- and -peat and -peat was
combined with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">VoilÃ </ENAMEX>, another fractonym!

            Then we could have retronym, meaning a word
formed by reversing the spelling of another word.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lord Kelvin</ENAMEX> is credited with coining mho by reversing
the spelling of ohm .  An ohm is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of electrical
resistance (named for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Georg</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simon Ohm</ENAMEX>), and a mho is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of conductivity of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> is one ohm.  We could also call
mho a backword , but we are better off staying with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of -onyms.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Retronym</ENAMEX> derives from the
combining form retro- (from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> retro meaning
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">backward</ENAMEX>).

            A related word is needed for a word with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>,
opposite meanings.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanction</ENAMEX> means to forbid and
also to permit.  Moot means a debate, and a moot
point originally meant a debatable point and then
also came to mean a point that was not debatable or
not worth debating.  Such a perplexing word might
be called a contronym, using the prefix contra- (from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin contra</ENAMEX> meaning against), or possibly a contradictonym.
            

            
We also need a word for a word that illustrates its
own meaning.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxymoron</ENAMEX> means a phrase that contrasts
opposites for a literary effect, e.g., a deafening
silence.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Oxymoron</ENAMEX> derives from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> oxymoros
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meaning</ENAMEX> pointedly foolish, which itself derives from
oxy- , a combining form meaning sharp (from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> oxus meaning sharp) and moron (from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> moros meaning dull).  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxymoron</ENAMEX> is an oxymoron.
But what should we call such an unusual
word?  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is etymonym (pronounced <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ehTYM-o-nym</NUMEX>),
using the coined combining form
etymo- (from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> etymon meaning the true
meaning of a word, which derives from etymos meaning
true or real).  This is not as rare a category as you
might think.  Another etymonym is noun (noun is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noun</ENAMEX>).  Prefix almost qualifies; at least it illustrates a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prefix</ENAMEX>.

            Then, there should be a word for a word that has
an etymology that is no longer true.  Atom literally
means a hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> that is so small that it is
incapable of being further divided.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Atom</ENAMEX> derives
from the combining form a- (from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> a
meaning not and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> tomos , meaning cut).
Of course, in the age of neutrons, protons, electrons,
and even quarks, we now know that an atom is not a
particle that cannot be divided into smaller particles.
So we need a word for outdated etymologies.
Possibly pseudoetymonym, using the combining
forms pseudo- and etymo- .  Another possibility is
gerontoetymonym, (pronounced ger-ON<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-to-ehTYM-o-nym</TIMEX>)
using the combining forms geronto-
meaning old (from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> gerontos meaning old
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>) and etymo-.  Perhaps better to stay with pseudoetymonym
and save the prefix geronto- to form
gerontonym , meaning an old word, especially one
whose original meaning has been altered, but is not
necessarily now false.

            The category of eponyms might be subdivided to
add literatonym (pronounced lit-er-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AH</ENAMEX>-to-nym),
meaning a word derived from the name of a person
or place in literature and mythonym , meaning a literatonym
derived from mythology ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herculean</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hercules</ENAMEX>, and, less obviously, martial from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>).  A
well known literatonym is serendipity, often used
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imprecisely</ENAMEX> to mean anything found by good luck,
but precisely meaning something good that is unexpectedly
found while looking for something else.
Serendipity was coined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horace Walpole</ENAMEX> from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">fairy tale, The Three Princes of Serendip</ENAMEX> (the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ancient</ENAMEX> name for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceylon</ENAMEX>), who often set sail for one
destination and found something even better, by fortunate
accident.

            What should be call these new words?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neologism</ENAMEX> is sometimes used, but it means not only
a new word but also the use of new words.  Besides,
better to stay with the -onym ending and call such
words neonyms , using the combining form neo-
(from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> neos meaning new).

            Finally, we need a word for all these words that
identify a category of words â€” the existing words
such as synonym, antonym, and homonym, and the
suggested neonymsâ€”bicronym, fractonym, etymonym,
and the others.  The obvious answer is
nymonyms, or, a bit catchier, nymnyms â€”word
words.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mad for Words: A Tale of Murder, Insanity</ENAMEX>,
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Making of the Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX>
            At the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> held to launch this book
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last spring</TIMEX>, the current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of the OED
were green with envy.  How could <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Winchester</ENAMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> best known for travel books, have earned
a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> advance for this book?  And why
would the film rights be worth even moreâ€”a cash
payment in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the six</TIMEX> figures sterling?  It is, after all, a
description of what they do <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> as lexicographers.

            
The heart of the story concerns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> gents
who copy words out of old books and write about
them in a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>.  It does not seem the sort of
action-adventure story that would lend itself to film
treatment.  Much as those of us who love words
would wish for it, a film biography of Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray</ENAMEX> isn't the stuff to draw <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to the multiplex
theatres out by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX>.  A fine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX>, a self-educated
and proud <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, but one whose favorite
recreation was riding a huge tandem tricycle around
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> and the surrounding countryside.

            Hint: it's the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>.

            The other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> gentleman with a library of old
books and the recreation of copying curious words
out of them was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Chester Minor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">M.D.</ENAMEX>, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> and one of the most
faithful and useful of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteer readers</ENAMEX>.
Speaking to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philological Society</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1899</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Murray</ENAMEX>
declared: So enormous have been Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minor</ENAMEX>'s contributions
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 17 or 18 years</TIMEX>, that we could
easily illustrate the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four centuries</TIMEX> from his quotations
alone.  Minor did little else than make word
indexes to old books; it was an obsession with him.

            If the filmic possibilities aren't yet clear, we
should begin with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minor</ENAMEX>'s birth in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ceylon</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1834</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Winchester</ENAMEX> invents some luscious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>: young,
chocolate-skinned, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">giggling</ENAMEX> naked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> with sleek wet
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> and rosebud nipples and long hair and coltish
legs with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">scarlet</ENAMEX> and purple petals folded behind their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ears</ENAMEX>, who play in the white <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indian Ocean</ENAMEX> surf and who
run, quite without shame, along the cool wet sands on
their way back home (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40</NUMEX>).  Here, perhaps, the cinematic
possibilities become a little more obvious.

            These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> are not, perhaps, altogether fictional;
Minor would later tell people that he began to entertain
lascivious thoughts about the time he was thirteen.
And his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> thought it was a good time to
send him back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Haven</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX>
while he got more education than the mission schools
could provide.  (In a characteristic flight of the travel-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">imagination</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winchester</ENAMEX> hints that the parents
were sending him back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> where frolicsome
female nudity was, they thought, less common.)

            Minor earned his medical degree from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1863</TIMEX> and immediately enlisted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Army</ENAMEX>.  The
life of an army <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX> in that dismal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> was horrifying,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minor</ENAMEX> could not have felt optimistic since
neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vicksburg</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gettysburg</ENAMEX> had yet produced
hope that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> would be preserved.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1864</TIMEX>, he was treating the wounded from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle of</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wilderness</ENAMEX>, part of the brutal and grueling campaign
that would take so many lives in the peninsula
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>.  But it was not that carnage that so influenced
Minor's life, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winchester</ENAMEX>'s view, but the order
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> brand an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> deserter on the face
with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> Fear of retribution from the unforgiving
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish</ENAMEX>, combined with those <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sri Lankan</ENAMEX> girls, is
adduced by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winchester</ENAMEX> as a factor leading to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minor</ENAMEX>'s
life as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">dictionary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> eventually recognized that there was
something badly wrong with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minor</ENAMEX>, and when he continued
to serve as a medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiner</ENAMEX> after the war, it
became apparent that he was unfit for his responsibilities
as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> in the medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corps</ENAMEX>.  He was, in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1868</TIMEX>, diagnosed as delusional and taken for treatment
to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>.  Released at the
behest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, he left for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1871</TIMEX>, with a box of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paints</ENAMEX>, some books, and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX>.

            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 17, 1872</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minor</ENAMEX> shot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merritt</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">brewery</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>, in the back of the neck as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merritt</ENAMEX> tried to flee.  He killed him, thinking him to
be an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irishman</ENAMEX> stalking him and bent on revenge.
And then, when a constable approached, he admitted
the shooting.  Minor was tried, found insane, and committed
to the asylum at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cawthorneâ</ENAMEX>€”hence the title
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winchester</ENAMEX>'s book in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Surgeon</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cawthorne: A Tale of Murder, Madness, and the Love</ENAMEX>
of Words.
            

            Minor eventually learned of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray</ENAMEX>'s great
project and began to copy words from old books.  And
then, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1902</TIMEX>, he cut off his penis.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winchester</ENAMEX> would like us to believe that this surprising
piece of surgery is connected to those lissome
beauties of Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lanka</ENAMEX> or to intimacies with Eliza
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merritt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX>.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Though Eliza</ENAMEX> had visited
Minor a few times and was grateful for his contributions
for the upkeep of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, the idea that they
had been intimate some fifteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years earlier</TIMEX> is utterly
speculative.  This is one of many flights of fancy during
which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winchester</ENAMEX> negotiates among the possible,
the probable, and the no evidence exists.)
Consider the movie: what script <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> would show us
Minor copying out words from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1693</TIMEX> volume called
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compleat Woman</ENAMEX> rather than a remorseful and
forgiving grapple with a tipsy Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merritt</ENAMEX>?

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1910</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> government yielded to
the importunings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> and let him go
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cawthorne</ENAMEX> had cared for him since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1872</TIMEX> and
now it was time to shift the costs of his upkeep to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>.  So, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, he went
to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Elizabeth</ENAMEX>'s in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washingtonâ</ENAMEX>€”Winchester
reminds us that an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Semite American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> and a
failed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assassin</ENAMEX> of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> have been
housed there too.  Minor wasn't quite through,
though; in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1915</TIMEX>, he smacked one of his fellow
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX>, though he had but little strength to hurt
anyone. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1919</TIMEX> his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX> urged that he be moved
to an asylum in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>.  On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 26, 1920</TIMEX>, he
diedâ€”at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">85 years and nine months</TIMEX>.

            Interspersed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minor</ENAMEX>'s story is the tale of the
editing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winchester</ENAMEX>'s story has an abundance
of mistakes.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Coleridge</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Philological Society's dictionary</ENAMEX>, was not the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">poet</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elisabeth Murray</ENAMEX>'s biography was
only taken on by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale University Press</ENAMEX>
had turned it into a bestseller and shamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OUP</ENAMEX> into
publishing it (OUP having earlier rejected it as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unworthy</ENAMEX>).  There are lexical curiosities as well.
Bugger grips is his intriguing term for what others
might call muttonchops or burnsides; he believes
that fulsome means exuberant.

            But these carpings are sour <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Winchester</ENAMEX>
is getting very rich from a story pretty well known to
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> interested in dictionariesâ€”particularly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Knowles</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OUP</ENAMEX> who unearthed basic
information and is rightly given, by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winchester</ENAMEX>, what
he would call a fulsome accolade.  He discovered a
Minor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendant</ENAMEX> and found a trove of correspondence
that makes the story much richer (and more
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">factual</ENAMEX>) than what was otherwise known.  He seems
to have overlooked a story in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Springfield</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> headlined <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Mad Dictionary Maker</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 25, 1915</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 16</ENAMEX>).

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winchester</ENAMEX> wants the story simple, and cinematic.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray</ENAMEX> should arrive at the gate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asylum</ENAMEX>
imagining it is some private residenceâ€”alas,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winchester</ENAMEX> tells us, a popular myth. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray</ENAMEX> knew
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minor</ENAMEX> was in the asylum; it was as obvious from
the return address on his letters as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sing Sing would</ENAMEX>
have been to an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX>.  Minor was so
guilt-ridden over his prodigious sexual appetites
that he committed an autopenectomy, reducing his
organ to a stub that extended about one inch from
its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>.  These are alluring possibilities for film.
And remarkable accents to a story that is essentially
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly gentlemen</ENAMEX> making a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>.

            On the So-called Debate over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black English</ENAMEX>



            Perhaps no issue better illustrates the poverty of
our political and intellectual culture than the so-called
debate over <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Black English</ENAMEX>, or as it has now
been christened, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ebonics</ENAMEX>.

            The confusions are many; the emotions are high,
and the political ramifications obvious.  It may be of
interest to try to sort some of the issues out.

            
               Language or Dialect?
            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oakland School Board</ENAMEX> proclaimed that
Ebonics was a language, and that teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ebonics</ENAMEX> was an exercise in bilingualism,
comparable, in principle, to teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX>.  The outcry was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">impassioned</ENAMEX> and predictably hostile.

            The debate is virtually meaningless.  Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
of language understand that whether <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> varieties
of speech are considered dialects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> language
or separate languages is as much a political
question as it is a linguistic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.  So, for example, the
varieties of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mandarin, Cantonese</ENAMEX>, etc.) are
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> as different as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romance Languages</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, etc.).  That one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is
referred to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as</NUMEX> dialects, and the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> as languages
has more to do with national boundaries than
any internal feature of the speech varieties themselves.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguist</ENAMEX> characterized a language as a
dialect with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navy</ENAMEX>.

            
               Bad English
            

            Much of the debate has been couched in terms
of lowering standards, the dumbing-down of the
education system, etc.  For example, in a syndicated
column, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen Goodman</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seattle Times</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 1996</TIMEX>) snidely compared <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Black English</ENAMEX> I be
with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> Je suis, and characterized the former
as merely bad <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, as opposed to a valid language.

            Even the most superficial analysis of any speech
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> would reveal that certain varieties of
speech are prestigious and others are stigmatized,
and that what determines a particular variety's status
has virtually nothing to do with the internal features
of that variety and everything to do with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>,
and in this case the race, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> involved.  In
short, the issue is the color of their skin, not the color
of their vowels.

            But the confusions are deeper, and more insidious.
I was on a recent talk show, where the host
referred to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Black English</ENAMEX> as illiterate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thugs</ENAMEX>. The juxtaposition of the two terms is revealing.
An academic feature, namely literacy, is
assumed to correlate with a moral one.  In other
words, bad <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is what is spoken by bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
This assumption is pervasive in our society.  Someone
who speaks a prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dialect</ENAMEX> is thereby thought
to be honest, clean, trustworthy and admirable.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine used to teach remedial reading
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> public school system.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> was
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who had repeatedly failed, and was
referred to as the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX>. On the first
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">day</ENAMEX>, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> would tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>, I'm supposed to
teach you how to read.  But, let's get one thing
straight; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> knew how to read, and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>
didn't, and I'll take my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> any
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.  The difference between my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> friend
and the radio talk show <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> is crucial.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schooling</ENAMEX> and
morality are not synonymous, and probably show virtually
no significant correlation.  In the current discussion,
familiarity with the prestige dialect does not
correlate with moral virtue.

            
               Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basic Linguistics</ENAMEX>
            

            On this issue, it is sometimes difficult to know
who are worse, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX> or the bigots.
Columnists quote <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> who insist that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Black English</ENAMEX> are careless and lazy and that the
particular variety of speech involved has no rules.
That positions such as these are articulated and published
reflects a level of information analogous to
arguing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> is flat.

            In fact, an example of how rules in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Black English</ENAMEX>
differ from those of other dialects may be revealing.
Consider the following data.  (I hesitate to refer to
dialects as standard or nonstandard, since it seems
to me to give the game away.)

            In one dialect of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, the plural of nouns is
formed by adding [s] or [z] or [\?\], resulting in forms
like [posts] [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">boyz</ENAMEX>] and [bus\?\s] for posts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> .

            In my dialect of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, however, the plural of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">post</ENAMEX> is pronounced something like [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poss</ENAMEX>].  The simplest
mechanism for accounting for such a pronunciation
is by adding a phonological rule for the deletion
of [t] under certain circumstances.  So, for example,
prints and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prince</ENAMEX> are both pronounced [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prins</ENAMEX>].  The
rule, in fact, is more general, applying to [<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">d</ENAMEX>] as well.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Wines</ENAMEX> and winds are both pronounced [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waynz</ENAMEX>].
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX>, however, that the rule for the deletion of [t]
must follow the rule for forming the plural.
Otherwise, if [t] deletion preceded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plural</ENAMEX> formation,
then [post] would become [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pos</ENAMEX>] and the plural would
be [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pos\</ENAMEX>?\s].  Well, it turns out, that for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Black English</ENAMEX>, the plural of post is, in fact, pronounced
[pos\?\s].  Why?  Because they have essentially
the same rules as I have, but in the opposite order.  In
other words, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dialects:

            Dialect A: Plural formation.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dialect B. Plural</ENAMEX> formation followed by [t] deletion

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dialect C.</ENAMEX> [t] deletion followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">plural</ENAMEX> formation.

            
               Pedagogy
            

            Now, imagine the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> of reading with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> representing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each of the three</TIMEX> speech varieties.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dialect A</ENAMEX>, sees the written word
posts , and pronounces it [posts].  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> beams;
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> can get to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dialect</ENAMEX> B sees the written word posts , and pronounces
it [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poss</ENAMEX>].  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> might encourage the
student to enunciate more clearly.  Such a student
might not get to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, but could perhaps
aspire to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>.

            But now the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dialect C</ENAMEX> sees the word
written posts and pronounces it [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pos\</ENAMEX>?\s].  The teacher
is confused Get that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> an eye-exam; get that
student a hot lunch; get that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> something.  The
fact is that such a student has demonstrated the ability
to read.  What the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> needs is a better <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>.

            And, ultimately, that's one thing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oakland</ENAMEX>
School <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> was suggesting: the simple, commonsense
proposal that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> might be more effective
if they knew something about the speech patterns of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> they were trying to teach.  Unfortunately,
that proposal became obscured by the pointless
debate over whether <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Black English</ENAMEX> is or is not a language.

            
               History
            

            Another emotional, and largely irrelevant debate
resulted from the use by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oakland School Board of</ENAMEX>
the word genetic to refer to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Black English</ENAMEX>.  That some
actually took this to mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are born with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predisposition</ENAMEX> to acquire a particular language would
be laughable if it were not so pernicious.  (Some years
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>, there was a brief article in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> about
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> who had adopted a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infant</ENAMEX>, and was studying <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>, so that she would be
able to speak to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> when it grew up.  She was
equally misinformed but not as malicious as the current
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oakland School Board</ENAMEX>.)

            In fact, the origin of some of the features of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is of some theoretical, scholarly interest.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slaves</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> were systematically separated
from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, and put in situations where they
could not use their native language.  In such a situation,
what typically develops is what is referred to as a
pidgin, based on the language of the environment, in
this case, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  The next generation acquires this
language as a product of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">linguistic maturation</ENAMEX>,
and this variety is sometimes called a creole.  Over the
succeeding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, this language has undergone a
process of decreolization for obvious reasons.

            Now, what is of some interest is that because
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slaves</ENAMEX> in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> were not systematically isolated,
there is, as far as I can tell, no such thing as
Black <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>, for example.  In other
words, there is a historical explanation for the emergence
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Black English</ENAMEX>, but it surely has little relevance
to the current educational and pedagogical
debate.

            It still remains to be seen whether a rational,
coherent language policy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> can evolve in our educational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>.
Given the emotional and uninformed reaction so far,
it is hard to be optimistic.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Revising The F-Word</ENAMEX>




            Writing a book entirely about the word fuck,
aside from being a good way to guarantee cocktail-party
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chatter</ENAMEX>, exposes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criticisms</ENAMEX>.
Apart from the tiresome degradation of society
arguments from the puritanical, everyone is familiar
with this word in its many forms.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Newspapers</ENAMEX> coyly
refer to it with euphemisms and circumlocutions, Tshirt
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vendors</ENAMEX> stock shirts emblazoned with its many
parts of speech.  And everyone has a favorite passage,
unusual compound, or offbeat etymological
theory to promote.

            The original edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">The F-Word</ENAMEX> was a successful
project.  It included almost all of the important
uses of the word, and the introduction gave a
good picture of the word's history, both etymological
and social.  But there is always room for
improvement, and so when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX> determined
it was time to reprint, we decided that a
major revision could be supported.  The revision is
in progress at the time of this writing, and this is a
preliminary report on where things stand.

            
               Historical
            

            Interest in the historical aspect of the word fuck
has always been high; most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> cited various
anecdotes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Introduction</ENAMEX>.  We have accordingly
been trying to research and add any relevant
or interesting story.  The earliest example of fuck,
appearing in a ciphered version in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifteenth-century</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">poem Flen Flyys</ENAMEX>, has always been a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd-pleaser</ENAMEX>, since it is not only in codeâ€”suggesting
that the word was taboo even at that timeâ€”but
describes monks fucking.  (Seemingly a popular subject
for that eraâ€”an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early sixteenth century</TIMEX> apostil
refers to the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scribe</ENAMEX>'s fucking abbot.)  The
original edition gave sparse details on the background
of this poem and translated the cipher without
explaining it; even the mainstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage Dictionary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third Edition</ENAMEX>, gave more
complete treatment.  In the new edition, we will
give a thorough version of this attestation.

            The date of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</TIMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> openly printed use
of fuck in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Americaâ</ENAMEX>€”still the earliest we have discoveredâ€”provoked
the question of the first use of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fuck</ENAMEX> in the movies.  We are still researching this, but
it seems that fuck <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appeared in mainstream
movies around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MASH</ENAMEX> and Myra
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Breckenridge</ENAMEX> ); it had been used earlier in several
avant-garde films.  Unlike the literary world, where
provocative books such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ulysses</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterley</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lover</ENAMEX> led to legal battles over obscenity
issues, in the movies, no one tried to place fuck onto
film until the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> was ready for it.

            While fuck appeared in popular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">periodicals</ENAMEX> such
as The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Monthly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harper</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magazine</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playboy</ENAMEX> , and others by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, it took a bit more
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> for the word to, um, penetrate the august
pages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> .  The editorship of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> is usually creditedâ€”more usually, faultedâ€”
with that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>'s frequent use of the word, and
though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> did use it frequently under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ms.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>, in fact fuck appeared there, spelled in full,
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>, during the editorship of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">puritan William</ENAMEX>
Shawn, in a short story by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobbie Ann Mason</ENAMEX>:
Maybe you have to find out for yourself.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuck</ENAMEX>.  You
can't learn from the past. (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 3, 1985</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 81</ENAMEX>).

            The etymology of fuck has never ceased inspiring
comment.  The various purported acronymic origins
are still the first thing most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think of; we
will be expanding our treatment of this, and including
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> known appearance of an acronymic etymology
(in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>'s underground paper The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX>
Village Other), in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX>.  The most striking recent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> has been the popularity of the pluck
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">yew</ENAMEX> story, which conflates the origin of fuck with
an earlier piece of folklore about the origin of the
offensive backhand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-finger gesture.  According
to the original form of the tale, before the battle of
Agincourt, immortalized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry V</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> taunted the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> longbowmen by
waving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fingers at them, saying that those fingers
(used to pull back the bowstring) could never
defeat the mighty <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.  After the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> annihilated
the hapless <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> dead <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> to a
mere <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brits</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill S.</ENAMEX>'s count), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
responded by waving their <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fingers back at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> in the now-familiar gesture (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
version limits it to the single middle finger).  The
recent twist has been to note the fact that longbows
are traditionally made of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yew wood</ENAMEX>, and claim that
the act of drawing the bowstring was called plucking
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">yew</ENAMEX>; the victorious English not only waved
their fingers at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, but shouted We can
still pluck yew!  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pluck yew</ENAMEX>!  at them.  A few convenient
sound-changes brought us to our familiar
phrase fuck you.

            This story, totally ludicrous in any version, was
popularized on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Public Radio</ENAMEX> segment
Car Talk, where it was meant as a joke; many
unfortunates, particularly on the Internet, have
taken it seriously.  It will be debunked.

            On the serious side, considerably more etymological
information will be presented.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> is
grateful to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatoly Liberman</ENAMEX> for sharing the entry
(and bibliography) for fuck from his magnificent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">forthcoming etymological dictionary</ENAMEX>.  Liberman
argues convincingly that the word is part of a large
family of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germanic</ENAMEX> words having the form f + [short
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vowel</ENAMEX>] + [stop], having the base meaning to move
back and forth (not to thrust, as most dictionaries,
and the original edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">The F-Word</ENAMEX>, had it).  It is
probably a borrowing from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, Low <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flemish</ENAMEX>, but not a continuation of an Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
word.  He finds no Indo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> cognates (of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
futuo he notes It is a strange coincidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">futuo</ENAMEX> is also an f word).

            On the less serious, but still scholarly, side, we
will refer to the hilarious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Studies</ENAMEX> Out in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Left Field</ENAMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Defamatory Essays Presented to James D. McCawley</ENAMEX>
On His <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">33rd</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">34th</NUMEX> Birthday .  This remarkable collection
applies the principles of transformational
grammar to the analysis of sexual and scatalogical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vocabulary</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quang Phuc Dong</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Sentences</ENAMEX>

studies the grammaticality (in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s idiolect)
of such sentences as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micky</ENAMEX> fucked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle</ENAMEX>'s cadaver
in the ass (grammatical), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bret</ENAMEX> fucked the mannikin
through the hole he drilled in its throat (of
questionable grammaticality), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred</ENAMEX> fucked the
log through a hole that squirrels had made
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ungrammatical</NUMEX>).  The omission of this classic, first
published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX>, is unforgivable.

            Least forgivable of all was the omission of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allen</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walker Read</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1934</ENAMEX> classic <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">An Obscenity Symbol</ENAMEX>,
the most important article ever written on fuck ,
despite the absence of that word from the article
itself (a not uncommon situation in the field, I might
add).  The decision of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> (who even now is
hiding behind this circumlocution, but yes, it was
me) to forgo a bibliography should not have prevented
him from acknowledging this indispensable work.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Words and Senses</ENAMEX>
            

            A moderate number of new words or phrases,
and a smaller number of new senses, have been
added.  Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> suggested the addition of that
'70s hit, zipless fuck an act of intercourse without an
emotional connection, coined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erica Jong</ENAMEX> in Fear
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flying</ENAMEX> .  We had originally decided to omit it since
zipless was often used on its own to mean passionate
but emotionally uninvolved, but it does appear often
enough as a set phrase to deserve entry.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold</ENAMEX>
Zwicky, chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Studies</ENAMEX> Out in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Left Field</ENAMEX>
collection celebrated above, suggested genderfuck
instance of reversal of normal sex roles; (specifically)
transvestism, a common term whose absence can
only be explained using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnsonian</ENAMEX> formula, in
answer to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who has asked him why he
defined pastern as the knee of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>, ignorance,
Madam, pure ignorance.  Thanks to the diligent
research of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, we have pushed
this back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX> with frequent cites thereafter.
Another unfortunate omission was fuck <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddy</ENAMEX> a sexual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>, esp. a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> with whom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> engages in
casual sex, which we currently have found to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>
but have hopes of bettering.  To mercy fuck and sport
fuck we now add the even less pleasant hate fuck,
immortalized as the title of the first album of post-punk
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">band Pussy Galore</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> but found in the
'70s, and force-fuck, apparently coined because the
word rape wasn't shocking enough.  The bizarre lesbian
expression fuckerware party gathering for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> use of sex toys seems, contrary to expectations,
to be real; the definition of fist-fuck, originally
limited to anal fisting, has been widened (with citations)
to allow for vaginal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fisting</ENAMEX> as well.  More recent
additions are a new sense of ratfuck a busy party
marked by flagrant social climbing; insults such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fuckball</ENAMEX> and fuckrag (popularized in the movie
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scream</ENAMEX> ); and a number of marginal uses whose
admission is being debated, including fuck-trash
loathsome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and fuck monster promiscuous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, esp. a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> terms, omitted on policy
grounds from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> edition, are now being includedâ€”and
why not, with a word this widespread?
Fuckpig a disgusting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> (according to
Partridge, it dates to the nineteenth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>, a claim
I'd love to be able to verify) is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>, as is fuckwit
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool</ENAMEX>, fuckwitted stupid, and the absolutely
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delightful contestant</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bridget Jones</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Diary:</ENAMEX>
fuckwittage stupidity.  Fucktruck a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> engage in sexual activity had been
mentioned in the introduction as being <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian</ENAMEX>
(where it has been used since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>), a statement
rejected by numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondents</ENAMEX> who testified
to their activities in thusly named <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> noted that the word was
also used for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> on which one can meet prospective
sexual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> (both, curiously, referring to a
shuttle between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wellesley College</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.I.T. campuses</ENAMEX>).

            Many of these new items came from suggestions,
but most suggestions were ultimately useless.
Everyone and his or her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>, it seems,
has a favorite fuck -related usage.  And in most cases,
these appear to be expressions doomed to the
nonce world.  The introduction to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> edition
listed several such words, suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>,
such as clothesfuck difficulty in deciding what
clothes to wear and fuckbreak leave of absence
from work in order to get pregnant (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other
terms from this section, fuckload a large amount
and fuck-muscle the penis, were omitted for insufficient
evidence but will now be added).  Publication
brought a blizzard of ever more outrageous suggestions,
including (but not limited to) fuckadocio,
fuck-a<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-doodle-doo</ENAMEX>, and fuck-aroni, whose meanings
can only be guessed at.  Many suggestions also failed
to respect the nature of the definitions; several
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> commented on the absence of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">un-fucking</NUMEX>-believable,
which appears under <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-fucking-</ENAMEX>, infix, or
of fuck book, which is covered by fuck , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">adj.</ENAMEX>, pornographic;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">erotic</ENAMEX>.

            
               Antedatings
            

            As most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of historical dictionaries know,
the search for antedatingsâ€”citations earlier than
those previously known for a word or senseâ€”is a
crucial effort.  Early examples force us to rethink
what we thought we knew about the historical
development of language.  The original work for The
F-Word proved that fuck was used in a variety of
figurative senses far earlier than had previously
been believed, and that certain expressions were
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years or decades</TIMEX> older than anyone had realized.

            The number of antedatings we have found in
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last several years</TIMEX> has been small, which is both
good (in validating the quality of our original
research) and bad (no breakthroughs).  The insulting
epithets fuckface and fuckhead were originally
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> cited in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961 and 1962</TIMEX>, respectively.  Several of
the citations referred to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War Two</ENAMEX>, and a
euphemistic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX> example of fuckfaced suggested
that these terms were in use in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Happily,</ENAMEX>
we found solid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX> citations in an article published
in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989â€”an</TIMEX> article we had read,
without catching these cites.  This article also provided
a significant antedating for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.F.G.</ENAMEX> no fucking
good, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">abbreviation</ENAMEX> accidentally omitted from
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-Word</ENAMEX> but included in the book's parent work
with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> cite from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound fuck</ENAMEX>-me intended to invite sexual
advances, chiefly exemplified by fuck-me
               [shoes] (with various specific types of shoes), was
only attested to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>.  Several reliable sources
claimed familiarity to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s and 1970s</TIMEX>, and we
were able to confirm this with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX> citation from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musician</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Bowie</ENAMEX>.  The expression fuck-you
money, unknown to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> before a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> letter
called it to attention, was first cited to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>,
thanks to a search of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nexis</ENAMEX> database.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX>
subsequently discovered a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX> example.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.F.</ENAMEX> , a euphemistic form of motherfucker , had been
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attested</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX>; we found a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX> example buried
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert Gold</ENAMEX>'s excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jazz Lexicon</ENAMEX>.  Finally, the
best we had been able to do on titfuck was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>; a
Nexis search came up with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playboy</ENAMEX> example from
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>, which inspired a check of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Wilson</ENAMEX>'s
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playboy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Book of Forbidden Words</ENAMEX>, which
indeed had it.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> definition of fuckable,
sexually available, with a single <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX> example, was
pushed back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Rodgers</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Queens</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vernacular</ENAMEX>, which also supplied a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> cite for
mouthfuck, verb.

            An important goal of the revision has been to
include any famous use of relevant forms of fuck .
In the original version, we were content to have a
good smattering of examples from the earliest to
the most recent, but as long as the examples were
genuine attestations, we were satisfied.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preference</ENAMEX>
is given to actual examples in running text, then to
printed glossarial evidence, and finally to orally collected
examples.)

            Now we have made an effort to extend our evidence
from important or interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.  Thus,
we have added the famous scene in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catcher</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rye</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holden</ENAMEX> sees a fuck you graffito and
muses on his desire to protect his little sister
Phoebe from seeing such vulgarity.  Another important
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">citation</ENAMEX> is from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen Ginsberg</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howl</ENAMEX>, where
he has seen The best minds in my generation
destroyed by madness,...who let themselves be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fucked</ENAMEX> in the ass by saintly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motorcyclists</ENAMEX>, and
screamed with joy. Bufu a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual man</ENAMEX>, a
portmanteau from butt fucker, was already in with a
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> citation from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Valley Girl dictionary</ENAMEX>, but
we have added the use in the defining text of that
subculture, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Zappa</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Valley Girl</ENAMEX>: Like my
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English teacherâ€”He</ENAMEX>'s like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bufu</ENAMEX>...He like
flirts with all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> in the class.  Under fuck up
we have added the well-known opening lines to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Larkin</ENAMEX>'s poem This be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verse</ENAMEX>, the only
use of fuck to be regularly found in dictionaries of
quotations: They fuck you up, your mum and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX>. They may not mean to, but they do. And for
the literal sense, we learn from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liz Phair</ENAMEX> that I
want to fuck you like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>...I'll fuck you till your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dick</ENAMEX> turns blue.

            The regular program of gathering new evidence,
combined with database searches for underattested
forms, has delivered an impressive return of citations.
We have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> instead of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> examples of fubar
in the secondary sense drunk; up-to-date examples
for give a fuck, fuck act of sexual intercourse, fuckable,
fuck-all, fuckboy, fuckfest, and others; a valuable
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> cite for fuck an evil turn of events; more
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">florid</ENAMEX> entries in the stronger, more vivid, or more
elaborate curses section, and newly fleshed-out
entries for fuckee in both literal and figurative senses.
This evidence proves that these terms are all real
words, still in current use in the English-speaking
world.

            We have tried to keep deletions to a minimum,
chiefly by not including marginal terms in the first
place.  Any item with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or more</NUMEX> examples may be
considered secure; an item from a single non-glossarial
source that parallels an existing expression may
also be considered secure; an item with only a single
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glossarial</ENAMEX> citation would have been kept out unless a
confirming example could be solicited.  An included
marginal term, then, would be one from a single oral
or written source that does not parallel another term
and appears, in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>'s opinion, to be unlikely.
Those that are on the ropes for this revision, include
fuck-plug a contraceptive diaphragm, with a single
example from a college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>, a term not
subsequently found despite wide questioning and
extensive database searching; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fuck 5.b</TIMEX>. to trifle or
interfere with (that is, the usual sense of fuck with ,
but without the with), found in a single example
from a movie; and friggin in the rigging , a nautical
expression for loafing on duty, which is too uninteresting
a figurative sense even if it does have some
currency beyond the single oral example we have
found.

            And last of all, but first in the book, we are
adding something that no book should be without:
an epigraph.  The easily offended, who nonetheless
choose to pick up this book, will be faced with this
before they get to anything juicy:

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard R. Randall</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meredith F. Burrill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Orth</ENAMEX>, give a very good and welcome insight into
practical aspects of placename-giving.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Political</ENAMEX>
Changes and New Names,  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randall</ENAMEX> pays particular
attention to both the new names of politically
changed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> and also to the problems arising
when we try to record native names (as in transcription).
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Motive</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Placenaming Donald Orth</ENAMEX> discusses
motivation in naming a location and illustrates
his point with a very appropriate quote from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mysterious Island</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jules Verne</ENAMEX>.  He mentions, for
example, names that honor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>, names that have
a religious background, names that express ego
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gratification</ENAMEX> and toponymic habituation (in which
familiar names from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> are adopted to
make a place seem a little less strange), names which
show evidence of discovery, etc.  He stresses, however,
that The motives themselves may be explicit or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subconscious</ENAMEX>, but their conjunction at a given
moment is normally unpremeditated.  Even though
they may be considered separate events, there is a
direct linkage between the motive to name and the
name given.  In fact, it is difficult to consider one
without the other.  They are capable of reinforcing
one another in a number of ways. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 23</ENAMEX>.)

            Part <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> section opens with a reprint of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen Walker Read</ENAMEX>'s onomastic history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocky</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mountains</ENAMEX>, which is followed by a very lengthy
paper on No Names in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.  In the
latter work <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert M. Rennick</ENAMEX> professes that it is
only an introduction to the subject and asks for more
information so that more extensive research can be
done.  However, in this work the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> is unable to
convince this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> of the need for more such
research, and I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> would have benefitted
very much from an abridged presentation.  On
the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burrill</ENAMEX>'s article on Toponomy
and Cultural History is a very good example of
how toponomy (and lexicography in general) and
history can benefit from each other.  Each culture
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> has its own ways of looking at nature, its own
set of distinctions between things in a general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>,
and its own rigid boundaries to thought that are
posed by its language.  Including terms for artifacts
of all kinds that are useful cultural clues, these elements
are reflected in toponyms. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 114-115</ENAMEX>.)  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> describes the use of specific terms and the
problems associated with them, beginning with the
word swamp, which is followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">creek</ENAMEX>, folly,
tump , and gurnet .  Especially, he says, the comparison
of the use of these words in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> and in
the respective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">homelands</ENAMEX> has promising results.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard</ENAMEX>).

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most readable of these articles is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell E. Brown</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Seghers</ENAMEX>' Revolt
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fishers</ENAMEX>, in which he shows how the author
establishes a certain universality for the uprising:
accordingly, the names can be attributed to no specific
place or time.  It seems that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Bretonic</ENAMEX> language
is not only the major source of character
names here, but Low <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> also play
a part.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> emphasizes that the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> languages
have a lot of names and spellings in common.
However, the source <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> uses for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch</ENAMEX>
names is hardly adequate: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van der Aa</ENAMEX>'s biographical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary only</ENAMEX> describes well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
and isn't meant to be an overview of all the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surnames</ENAMEX> in use.  For that information one should
turn to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nederlands Repertorium van</ENAMEX>
Familienamen edited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.J. Meertens</ENAMEX> and others,
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen</TIMEX> volumes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assen, Van Gorcum</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963-1988</TIMEX>).
Nevertheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s description of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s choice of a pen name and her symbolical
use of the name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marie</ENAMEX> in her novel are excellent
examples of the relevance of literary name studies.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxine M. Bernard</ENAMEX> covers the
work of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>, Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Scott</ENAMEX> and Barbey
d'Aurevilly, but because of this broad span her conclusions
are not always very convincing.  For example,
this is her interpretation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barbey</ENAMEX>'s religious
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monsters</ENAMEX> (the seductor and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rapist</ENAMEX> of an innocent
country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Nameless Story</ENAMEX> ):  The name
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riculf</ENAMEX> seems to be a clever composite of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> words: rire, meaning to laugh, comes
directly from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> rictus meaning a mocking
sneering laughter; and culer meaning to back
away or go astray.  His persona was just such a type:
mocking God, leading others astray, scornfully getting
away. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 219</ENAMEX>.)  She doesn't mention that this
name is a perfectly normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germanic</ENAMEX> name which
consists of rik- mighty and -ulf, wolf which is
itself a rather colourful name for a scoundrel.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> connection that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard</ENAMEX> suggests seems to
me rather farfetched and certainly needs more
proof, e.g., from significant quotations of the novel
itself.  I would go no farther than point out a possible
double meaning, and certainly would not proclaim
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> interpretation the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX>, but
would mention it only as a possible secondary
meaning.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>.  The contributors to Personal Names are

and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy E. Litt</ENAMEX>. Harder's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Literary Names</ENAMEX>
Mainstreamed As Given Names is very insightful:
How many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> realize that the currently popular
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer</ENAMEX> is derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guinevere</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur</ENAMEX>'s adulterous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX>) or that the name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pamela</ENAMEX>
became popular through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Richardson</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pamela</ENAMEX>; or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virtue Rewarded</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1740</TIMEX>)?  As the author
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naming</ENAMEX> now seldom reflects reading. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p.</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">231</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harper</ENAMEX>'s article about Sex
Differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linguistic Origins of Personal</ENAMEX>
Names is to the point and thorough.  An important
point they make is that although names nowadays
are often chosen without knowledge of their linguistic
roots and meanings, the linguistic background
nevertheless persists as an important basis for selection:
books of names generally provide information
about roots and meanings and as long as these books
are read and used, the knowledge of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">works</ENAMEX> will
form part of the choice.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 251</ENAMEX>.)

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eckler</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Single-Letter</ENAMEX> Surnames
we learn that all letters exist as a surname (and are
overwhelmingly likely to be held by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Oriental ancestry, p. 264</ENAMEX>), and only Q is missing.
The paper by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penelope Scambly Schott, Rosamond</ENAMEX>:
Poison and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Contamination</ENAMEX> gives a neat example of
historical confusion based on the fate of another
individual with the same name.  Thus, the fair
Rosamond of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> literatureâ<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">€”Henry II</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mistress</ENAMEX>
who died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1176â€”was</TIMEX> (also said to be) poisoned
to death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1592</TIMEX>, not in the flesh but on the
page.

            It isn't clear to this reviewer just what place the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Litt</ENAMEX> article, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Self-Naming</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Self-Defining</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Subscriptions to Familiar Letters in the English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>, is supposed to have in onomastics.
The author explicitly refrains from examples of
nomination, in code names, code-numbered names,
anonyms, pet names, name-changing, and other onomastic
oddities in this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 285</ENAMEX>).  Yet these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> seem to be more related to onomastics
than those she has described in this paper and therefore
make the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> anxious to know more.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>.  Various Other Names.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> section of
the book ends with this general category, which
includes articles by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas P. Hinkle</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger W.</ENAMEX>
Wescott, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter P. Bowman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas L. Bernard</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. Wallace McMullen</ENAMEX>.  While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinkle</ENAMEX> admits
he has barely scratched the surface in his article, yet
in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Street-Language Naming Practices</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Hispanic Drug and Underworld Subcultures</ENAMEX>, he
goes into great detail and tells us quite a bit (e.g.,
that a snort of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> is called a narizÃ³n , from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nariz</ENAMEX>, nose, which compares to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
slang snootful).  Anyone curious about technical linguistics
will take delight in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wescott</ENAMEX>'s comments on
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Phonology of Proper Names</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  He is
of the opinion that slang has formal as well as
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">semantic</ENAMEX> peculiarities and that names resemble slang
in this respect. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 301</ENAMEX>)  Thus, he tells us, names can
exhibit phonetic alternation.  An example is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence Jean</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jen</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>)y, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan</ENAMEX>
(ultimately derived from a single <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Biblical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>
name meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jehovah</ENAMEX>'s mercy).  He also mentions
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> types of palindromization (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> will suffice
here): progressive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>: pap<pa or=paw; and</txt>=<txt><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">regressive additive</ENAMEX>: Nan<Ann or=Anna .=Thus, a</txt>=<txt>good number of common changes are explained for
us.  For example, one extreme lexical transformation
is the nickname Poll which is derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>, in
which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> has been both occluded and unvoiced,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">a</ENAMEX> has been retracted, the r has been lingualized,
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> has been dropped. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 306</ENAMEX>.)

            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Musical Names: The</ENAMEX>
Titles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Symphonies</ENAMEX> is a beginning on an abundant
onomastic field.  Among those already well-known,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlioz</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Symphonie Fantastique</ENAMEX> appears at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to
be an instrument of revenge against one heartless
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lady</ENAMEX> and (using the same title) also a means of admiration
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> toward his future fiancÃ©e.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Bowman</ENAMEX>
describes how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composers</ENAMEX> have used placenames to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> feelings evoked by visits (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dvorak</ENAMEX>'s
From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX>), or to express a nationalistic
or patriotic regard for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hindemith</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh Symphony</ENAMEX>).  Personal names as well as
political events or dates function in symphony titles.
Also literature has left its mark (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liszt's Faust</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowman</ENAMEX> concludes his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> with some fascinating
oddities.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Bernard</ENAMEX>'s Names,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nationality</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Incongruity Factor</ENAMEX>, our attention
is called to the fact that a good number of people
have names that don't seem to correspond with
their nationality.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> example will suffice: until
recently one wouldn't assume that someone with the
name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fujimori</ENAMEX> would be a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Peruvian</ENAMEX>.

            The last article in the volume is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McMullen</ENAMEX>'s
History of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Names Institute</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980-86</TIMEX>.  A companion

            But this isn't all: the book has extensive indices,
e.g., the admirable Index (e) which contains the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abstracts</ENAMEX> (all written by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Topics</ENAMEX> of

(e) form a helpful guide for onomasticians on the
move who are looking for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> in discussions
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> items of mutual interest.  In brief, then, it is
my opinion that this neat, hardbound, onomastic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anthology</ENAMEX> is indeed very readable.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX>, as I was arranging my notes on solecisms
called from television, radio, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>,
I suddenly realized that updating the long list, even
without citing dates and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perpetrators</ENAMEX>, had begun to
take up too much time.  Of course, as I had been
telling myself all along, police work is tedious; but
someone has to do it.  Or so I had always thought.
Now, however, I paused in my labors after a short
stint of alphabetizing and partially annotating a few
recent additions, to wit:



[<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Budget</ENAMEX>] cuts were made all across the border.

[The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>] must definitive his position.

...a fashion that was dig <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">rigueur</TIMEX>...

Now we are being indulged[<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">deluged</ENAMEX>] with snow.

He waived goodbye. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> article)

The fee was wavered.

Somehow, he wrangled an invitation.

The [victorious] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> yielded power harshly...
            

            It was the last example which gave me pause.
Perhaps, I thought, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> yielded power harshly
while wielding a no-iron velvet fist?

            Already, while working my head to the bone 
               
on the above examples and others too humorous to
mention, I had been visited by fond memories of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodman Ace</ENAMEX>, those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> of malapropismâ€”though,
according to an article in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorker</ENAMEX> which I read <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman</ENAMEX> was the
master; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane</ENAMEX> was a real-life Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malaprop</ENAMEX>. I had
made a list of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Aceisms</ENAMEX> in that article.  I still
had that list and now, rather than just sitting there
like a bum on a log, I compared <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane</ENAMEX>'s words with my
own burgeoning record of unstrung and unlamented
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lapses</ENAMEX>, many, still to be entered in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trustee</ENAMEX> notebook.

            When I had at last poured over the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> listsâ€”
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, so much too brief; the other, so much too
wrongâ€” you could have knocked me over with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fender</ENAMEX>!  What a disillumining experience!  Entre nous
and me , until then, I had believed that, in any baffle
of wits, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Ace</ENAMEX> would have won, thumbs down.  In
all my bored <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, I would never have believed that
she had not reached the highest pinochle of success.
Now, I was saddened to see that her words, compared
with those of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s ragged individualists,
were thin and emancipated.  No longer was she the
human domino she had always seemed to me.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hey,</ENAMEX>
you, and a lass, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Ace</ENAMEX>!  Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">turkeys</ENAMEX> have come
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to roast, with avengings!

            I saw that it was high tide for me to stop wrecking
my brain looking for more more flies in the oatmeal .
It was time, too, to remember that words, like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, are cremated equal.  In short, if hers was to
remain the clowning achievement, it was time for me
to shred my listâ€”and not a moment to swoon.
            
               Italicized phrases are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Aceisms</ENAMEX>.  All other anomalies are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s.
