                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cameroon Pidgin Saying</ENAMEX>
               
               [Literally, In dire straits, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> will even eat chillies or Anything will do in an emergency.]
            

            Pidgin <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is spoken by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> all
over the Third World.  There are many varieties,
but they are all most expressive and entertaining.
The most publicized is probably <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tok Pisin</ENAMEX>, the pidgin
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Papua New Guinea</ENAMEX>.  This has developed into
a language in its own right.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wantok</ENAMEX> , is published entirely in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tok Pisin</ENAMEX>, and there are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> radio programs in it,.
Attempts have even been made to introduce the
works of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> by translating
them into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tok Pisin</ENAMEX>.

            No one who has ever seen the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bard</ENAMEX>'s immortal
words, I come to bury <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Caesar...</ENAMEX>, reduced to Mi
kam tasol long plantim Kaesar ... can be expected
to take <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> too seriously again.  And a Tok
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pisin</ENAMEX> version of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Little Red Riding Hood</ENAMEX>, told me
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years ago</TIMEX> by an old <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China Sea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sailor</ENAMEX>, remains
to this day one of the most hilarious monologues I
have ever heard.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tok Pisin</ENAMEX> does not stand on ceremony, either.
Even the formidable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edinburgh</ENAMEX> was heard
to remark ruefully on an official visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Papua New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Guinea</ENAMEX> that it was very difficult to maintain a stiff
upper lip when one was constantly being introduced
as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitefella Blongum Kween</ENAMEX>.

            But it is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Pidgin</ENAMEX> with which I am most
familiar.  This is the lingua franca of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Africa</ENAMEX>.  I
worked as a forester on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">The Coast</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</TIMEX>,
so I suppose I had more time than most to become
fluent in the language.  Here, too, there are subtle
differences from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to another both in the
spoken word and in the written word, from the phonetic
Krio of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Leone</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Liberia</ENAMEX> to the more
straightforward pidgins of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigeria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cameroon</ENAMEX>.

            But, whatever its background, pidgin remains
colorful and, often, onomatopoetic.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Coast</ENAMEX> Pidgin
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mud</ENAMEX> becomes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">putta-putta</ENAMEX> and noise becomes
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wahallah</ENAMEX> .  A phrase like I have been involved in an
accident becomes, graphically, I dun fukkup .  One's
outrage over some disastrous contretemps is alleviated
somewhat by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">culprit</ENAMEX>'s risible attempts to explain
away the circumstances of his crime in pidgin.

            I had in my employ, for a mercifully brief period,
an ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caretaker</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sixpence</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sixpence</ENAMEX>'s main
claim to fame was that, as a very young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lad</ENAMEX> living in
Cameroon, he had been employed by the celebrated
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Kingsley</ENAMEX> as a houseboy.  His relationship with
the renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX> had ended in some acrimony
after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just eight hours</TIMEX>, during which time Sixpence
had managed to consign the whole of her insect collection
(painstakingly accumulated for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX>) to the bonfire which he had lit in the compound
outside her chalet for the express purpose of
burning the rubbish from within it.  This was the day
on which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sixpence</ENAMEX>'s innocence had come to an end,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss Kingsley</ENAMEX>'s sulfurous expertise with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
language had remained indelibly etched in his
memory all his life.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sixpence</ENAMEX>'s eyesight was failing badly when we
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> met, and he was disaster-prone.  <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gas</ENAMEX> cooking had
just been introduced to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in the
area at the time I hired him, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sixpence</ENAMEX>, I was
soon to find out, had much to learn about the dangers
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> cylinders.  I was walking up the path one
day when a colossal explosion rent <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> asunder and
a large part of my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> fell down before my eyes.
I stumbled through the dust and the ruins to find
Sixpence, dazed but miraculously unscathed, sitting
amidst the debris.  Na some kine ting meka na
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WHISSSSH</ENAMEX> lika na shanake foh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> dahk konna, he
explained aggrieved, I go put fiah mek I look am
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gooh</ENAMEX>.  Den de whole forking place go jakarah.  [A
slightly bowdlerized translation might read: I heard
a sound which I took to be the hiss of a snake emanating
from a dark corner.  I lit a match in an endeavor
to locate the reptile.  Then the whole deuced building
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disintegrated</ENAMEX>.]

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pidgin</ENAMEX> loses much of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> when written,
and it is a sad fact that both the writing and the speaking
of it is discouraged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in many of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Africa</ENAMEX>'s
more modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> for much the same reason, I suppose,
that I remember <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years ago</TIMEX> being made to
feel an outcast for having Gaelic as my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> tongue
in an English-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> in my native <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> would hope that the evocative pidgin will be kept
alive.  If it is, it will be due in no small part to the efforts
of a few of the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> in the hinterland.  I
am not, alas, of their faith, but I had to admire the command
these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">old-timers</ENAMEX> had of tribal languages in general
and of pidgin in particular.

            It was from one of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> that I
obtained a copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genesis</ENAMEX> in pidgin <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  It was
a version still being used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> in parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nigeria</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cameroon</ENAMEX> when I was there:

            One is almost tempted to remark, Eat your heart
out, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy Graham</ENAMEX>!

            There is no doubt in my mind that, without pidgin,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Africa</ENAMEX> would be the poorer.  It is a language
of humor and it can lighten the darkest of moments.  I
have rarely known a situation so bad that a few words
of pidgin could not make it seem a little brighter.

            It was the height of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rainy season</TIMEX> and I
had hitched a ride with an old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> missionary to a
ceremony <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several hundred miles</NUMEX> away to which we had
both been invited.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> were a sea of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mud</ENAMEX> and
now, with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> approaching, we were stuck, finally and
irrevocably, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the rainforest</TIMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river</ENAMEX> in
front of us thundered over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> where just <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the day</TIMEX>
before a wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> had spanned it.  Behind us, a
colossal <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> had fallen across the road, effectively blocking
our retreat.  We had not eaten since <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, and
the chances of our doing so in the next twelve hours
looked slim indeed.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">troupe</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chimpanzees</ENAMEX> emerged from the forest
beyond the river.  They were the wettest looking
monkeys I had ever seen.  They stopped and stared
at us, then began a chorus of hooting noises that
echoed out through the treetops.  I swear that they
were laughing at us.

            No <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> for us <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this night</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>, I said sorrowfully.
In fact, at this rate we'll be lucky to eat
before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>!

            He did not reply immediately.  He was ferreting
around behind the car seat.  He hauled out a disreputable-looking
traveling bag and rummaged inside.  I
caught glimpses of a white soutane, some underpants,
a string of rosary beads, a big black <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>.  Finally, he
unearthed what he was looking for.  He removed the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cork</ENAMEX> and handed the bottle to me.  The twinkle was
back in his wise old eyes.  Jam pass die, he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Monkey chop peppeh</ENAMEX>.

            I took a long, long pull at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>'s finest.  I felt
it kindle heavenly fires within me right down to the
soles of my boots.  Suddenly, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> did not seem so
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wet</ENAMEX> and muddy and dreary after all.  I handed the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">amber</ENAMEX> nectar back to the Reverend <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>.  The old
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> raised the bottle to his lips and we watched as
the chimps scurried silently, one behind the other,
back into the sodden forest.

            Yes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>, I replied with quiet satisfaction.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Monkey chop peppeh</ENAMEX>, indeed!
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Day They Took the Peck</ENAMEX> out of Pecksniffian




            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erskine Caldwell</ENAMEX> must have felt that one lexical epoch
was enough for him.  He stayed with the same old
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New Collegiate Dictionary</ENAMEX> he began with; when
it threatened to come apart he would have it rebound.  As
a contributor to the language and one whose writings
were confined to a snapshot of time and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caldwell</ENAMEX>
could well afford to stand pat.  As a mere word <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>, I must
keep up with the times.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every twenty years</TIMEX> or so I upgrade
my dictionary.

            It was in that spirit of personal progress that I replaced
my <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary</ENAMEX> with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ninth</ENAMEX>.  Upgrading is a pain; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> of accumulated notes,
highlights, and cross-reference jottings must be transferred
to the sterile new edition.  Things were going fine
until I got to the word <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pecksniffian</ENAMEX> .  It was still there, but
the definition had been cleansed of its contemptible meaning
and made tolerably benign.  After entering the proper
definition in the margin, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Selfish</ENAMEX> and corrupt behind a
display of seeming benevolence, I sat down to decipher
the new version: unctuously hypocritical.  That is about
as easy to embrace as a wet eel, about as useful as a punctured
balloon.  Describing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pecksniffian</ENAMEX> scoundrel as
merely hypocritically hypocritical implies that something
can indeed be less than nothing, as that theory was catechized
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Dickens</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seth Pecksniff</ENAMEX>, made his
debut about the time the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YMCA</ENAMEX> was founded, only a few
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P.T</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnum</ENAMEX> introduced us to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swedish</ENAMEX>
Nightingale, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jenny Lind</ENAMEX>.  As words go, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pecksniffian</ENAMEX> is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">youngster</ENAMEX>.  The word <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calvinism</ENAMEX> was coined in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vasco da</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gama</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>, and during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the four centuries</TIMEX> since has been
left pretty much alone.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seth Pecksniff</ENAMEX> could no more
undergo a post-mortem metamorphosis than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Calvin</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX> certainly was not wishy-washy when it came to
developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seth Pecksniff</ENAMEX> was definitely
not just a quick study among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Chuzzlewit</ENAMEX> .

            Something sinister is up, thought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX>  Why would a
lexicographer snatch up a unique, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dickensian</ENAMEX> creation, gag
him and bind his real persona hand and foot, then slyly
stand an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">impersonator</ENAMEX> in his place?  This is clearly a sign
of unctuous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypocrites</ENAMEX> at work.  Did the decriminalization
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pecksniff</ENAMEX> have more expansive implications?  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Persons</ENAMEX>
in high places would any day rather be called hypocritical
than corrupt.  With queasy, frantic haste as one might
inventory his burgled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>, I looked up corrupt .
Whew!  Still intact: morally degenerate and perverted.
I had been prepared for anything: hypocritical, demonstrating
poor judgment,...

            For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merriam-Webster</ENAMEX> has held out
an explicit definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pecksniffian</ENAMEX> , one precisely consistent
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pecksniff</ENAMEX> we know, and usage has squared
with that definition.  It was a special word, unambiguously
descriptive of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users</ENAMEX> have been
respectfully fussy about employing that distinctive word;
it has not been slung around indiscriminately, as quintessential
is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.  A literal translation of unctuously
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypocritical</ENAMEX>--the phrase does demand some translation--
would describe ordinary slick <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> mainly putting on
airs.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hypocrites</ENAMEX>, even hypocritical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypocrites</ENAMEX>, are a dime
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX>.  One can see a parade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> on TV any
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>.  Sometimes they even pop up in our bathroom
mirrors.

            But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pecksniffians</ENAMEX> are a different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breed</ENAMEX>.  They are not
simply <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> who display contrived earnestness and
advertise virtues they don't have, like the big smile and
self-bestowed nickname <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honest John</ENAMEX> , your friendly usedcar
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pecksnifflan</ENAMEX> is not so benign.  Fortunately
for society, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pecksniffians</ENAMEX> are spread pretty thin among the
general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.  It would scarcely concern a Pecksniff
that we suspected that he is not what we had first thought--
or hoped for.  What he desperately hopes to conceal is what
he truly is: corrupt!

            Yes, I realize the living nature of language.  I expect
gradual evolutionary changes in word usage.  But the sanitizing
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pecksniffian</ENAMEX> was no more evolutionary than the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stallion</ENAMEX>'s transmutation to a gelding.  The old and new
definitions are so opposed as to be in mortal combat.  One
might want to keep one's guard up when dealing with an
unctuously hypocritical old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>, but that comes somewhat
naturally because unctuosity in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> is pretty easy
to spot.  But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unctuous hypocrites</ENAMEX> are not the sort who
would make a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500 billion</NUMEX> raid on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Treasury</ENAMEX> in broad
daylight.  That kind of a job demands the talents of genuine
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pecksniffian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pecksniffian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pals</ENAMEX>.
Was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Keating</ENAMEX>, as he passed out worthless bonds
in exchange for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>' retirement nest
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>, merely unctuously hypocritical, or was he corrupt
behind a display of seeming benevolence?

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pecksniffian</ENAMEX> TV evangelist might conceivably--
heaven forbid--revile sin and sinners while wallowing in
the conduct that he rails against.  A particularly talented
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reverend Pecksniff</ENAMEX> actually averted the destruction of
his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> with a tele-tearful explanation that his debauchery
was sacrificial and in the line of duty: It was on-the-job
training for hand-to-hand combat with the devil!, he
explained.

            There is a movement to decriminalize the meanings
of words that once described criminal conduct in
unmistakable terms.  I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> noticed it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX>,
coincident with the apex of the looting of the savings and
loans, about when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merriam-Webster</ENAMEX> discovered the tolerable
side of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seth Pecksniff</ENAMEX>.

            Then, after that, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Penal Code</ENAMEX> redefined car
theft to unauthorized use of a motor vehicle and
decreased the penalty for the crime.  We should reflect that
all <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse James</ENAMEX> did was ride about making unauthorized
withdrawals from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>.  Who can say what the federal government
had up its sleeve when it softened the term narcotics
and began calling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> controlled
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> .  Dope <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addicts</ENAMEX> in that nature of things became
mere substance abusers --new terminology that seemed
to come about when some high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>
were accused of shooting up on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX> and sniffing coke.
The old illegal numbers racket was vigorously battled by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice squads</ENAMEX> across the land until the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> got into the
business.  Presto! The wicked numbers game is a racket
no more, but a respectable, highly promoted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lotto</ENAMEX>, the
hottest gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX> ever conceived.

            Who would have ever dreamed that pursuit, apprehension,
and prosecution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> was the wrong tactic
in the war on crime?  Now that we have discovered that
we can slash the crime rate by simply excising the peck
from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pecksniffian</ENAMEX> , so to speak, we should enter the 21st
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> with everybody living happily ever after.
         
         
            A Proper Look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verbs</ENAMEX>




            She was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christian Diored</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> to foot.  Do you
know how to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charleston</ENAMEX>?  The plot was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holly</ENAMEX>-woodized .
Would you xerox this page for me?  They
Sundayed at the lake.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> is pasteurized .  He
Christied down the slope.  All these italicized words
belong to a sizable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of verbs based on names--
names of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, brands, places, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">time</TIMEX> periods, and so on.
But although we can talk about proper nouns and proper
adjectives, we do not have a proper term to classify such
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">verbs</ENAMEX>.  Surely they deserve to be classified, but as what?
The answer is not an easy one, so before trying to put forward
some ideas, let us start by looking at how similar nouns
and adjectives are classed.

            The words <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> , and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> examples
of what we usually refer to as proper nouns--those
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nouns</ENAMEX> that refer primarily to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, places,
and time periods and that are generally written with an
initial capital letter, Such words can also be termed
proper names or proper nouns, though these more
general terms may also include titles ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Times</ENAMEX>, Gone
With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wind</ENAMEX> ), nationalities ( the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> ),
ethnic or religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> ), languages ( <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swahili</ENAMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> ( the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Central Station</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Durham</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral</ENAMEX> ), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> ).

            Some grammar books go a step further, pointing out
that along with proper nouns there is also a category of
proper adjectives.  Proper adjectives, we are told, generally
derive from proper names and are also usually written
with an initial capital letter.  In the main they refer to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nationalities</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> ), places ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX>,
Himalayan, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balkan</ENAMEX> ), ethnic, linguistic, or religious groups
( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanskrit</ENAMEX>, Gaelic, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> ), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleonic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smithsonian</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dantesque</ENAMEX> ).  Sometimes a proper noun is used
attributively, as an adjective ( a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> buy ).

            Some proper nouns and proper adjectives that have
given rise to widely used expressions are normally written
with a lower-case letter; examples include cardigan,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boycott</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwich</ENAMEX>, platonic love, quixotic .  Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>,
however, prefer to categorize these as common nouns or
adjectives, labelling them eponyms --words derived from
names.  In fact, the name that originally inspired the word
is now often merely incidental to the meaning and presumably
in consequence the capital letter is omitted.
These factors appear to strip such words of proper status.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">OED</ENAMEX> states quite dogmatically that a proper noun
is written with an initial capital letter.  Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> are
not quite so outspoken; Merriam-Webster dictionaries
maintain that proper nouns are usually capitalized in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  Definitions tend to be gerrymandered to comply
with editorial policies.

            A small number of problems of capitalization--and
therefore of categorization--arise, as, for instance, with
words and expressions like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F/french fries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoover</ENAMEX>,
B/bohemian, C/casanova, S/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">scotch whisky</ENAMEX>, C/casarean .
In such cases there seem to be few hard and fast rules:
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> indicate a capital letter, others a small
letter, still others give both forms.  Here the dividing lines
between proper nouns and adjectives and eponymous
common nouns and adjectives become even hazier.

            But rather than pursue that obscure tack any further
(place names such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> are surely both
proper nouns and eponyms), let us see if the proper
categories of words really end there as grammar books
tend to suggest.  If we have proper nouns and proper
adjectives, can we not have proper verbs, too?  What
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> verbs such as boycott, hoover, gerrymander, pasteurize
(all based on personal names, though all usually
written with a small letter).  Can they not be termed
proper verbs?  Once again, as far as these verbs are concerned,
the answer would seem to lie in the lack of an
initial capital letter and the fact that they refer to something
very much removed from the naine itself.  For these
reasons, most grammarians would simply classify these
verbs as eponyms.

            If, however, we look at a few more verbs based on
names, the situation is perhaps not quite so clear cut.
Brand names, for example, are also regularly seen in verbal
form; some typical examples are shown in the following
sentences.  (All name-based verbs given as examples in
this article are included in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the OED2</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Slang</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman Register of New</ENAMEX>
Words unless otherwise stated.)

Could you please xerox this letter.

            

            Quite deliberately, some of these have been written
with capital letters and some with lower-case letters.  To
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coca-colonize</ENAMEX>, cellophane , and xerox appear to work quite
well with small letters, but capital letters are surely preferable
for many of the others.  It probably depends on how
widely used each individual verb is.  Whether or not a
capital letter is used may often be a question of personal
choice, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> frequently give both forms.

            Place names can also crop up in a verbal form,
C/charleston being a classic example.  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Countries</ENAMEX>, areas, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> used as verbs can often indicate a visit: you might
hear: They <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyprused</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> or We <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">'d</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last fall</TIMEX>
in the course of normal conversation.  But other more
specific meanings can become attached to places: to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benidorm</ENAMEX> means to develop (a seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> without
much respect to the natural landscape or the urban environment);
to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rubicon</ENAMEX> implies going beyond a point of no
return.  Hardly anyone is aware that the verb to meander
comes from the name of the winding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menderes</ENAMEX> river in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>.  Place names and the like often become verbs
when used with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an- ize or an - ify</NUMEX> suffix: The story was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hollywoodized</ENAMEX>;
The area risks being balkanized; The region
was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vaticanized</ENAMEX>; The decor was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frenchified</ENAMEX>; The country
is becoming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Swissified</ENAMEX>; The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant</ENAMEX> quickly became
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americanized; Standard British English</ENAMEX> is being <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cockneyfied</ENAMEX> .
Capital letters are generally used here, except for
verbs which have become fairly common.

            Capital letters usually seem compulsory for names of
time periods used as verbs.  We <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Christmased</ENAMEX> at home and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yeared</ENAMEX> in the mountains.  She <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> Fooled him would
look very strange with lower-case letters.  Likewise, capital
letters are essential in the song <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dishonest Modesty</ENAMEX> , by Carly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zach Weisner</ENAMEX>, where we find the magazines
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Garden, Vogue, Glamour, Mademoiselle, Bitch</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Screw</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penthouse</ENAMEX> all being used as verbs.

            Personal names probably constitute the largest category
of name-based verbs.  Frequently used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">verbs</ENAMEX> found
in dictionaries are usually written with lower-case letters
( boycott, bowdlerize, hoover ), the name behind the verb
being almost insignificant.  Other examples include to
braille , to biro , to grangerize , to malaprop , to spoonerize ,
and to morse .  But a more original, significant use of a personal
name in a verbal form is more likely to be written
with a capital letter.  Advertising copy, topical conversation,
and song lyrics seem to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> very fertile sources
of this latter use.  For example, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">song Rainbow High</ENAMEX> ,
from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Evita</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Lloyd Webber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Rice</ENAMEX>, we
find, So <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> Dior me, So Machiavell-me, So
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lauren Bacall</ENAMEX> me.

            There are numerous expressions based on famous
names that celebrate the well-known traits of the people
in question; here is a fairly short list:


She threatened to Bobbit him.

She Ciceroned us around the site.

He Tarzaned out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.

Don't <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Uncle Tom me so</ENAMEX>!

            

            The examples <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ponting</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Charming</ENAMEX> from
the above list are generally found as verbs only in
their - ing form, as that is their original form.  But few other
name-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">verbs</ENAMEX> seem to have such constraints, probably
because <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> is such a relatively uninflected language,
whereas many other languages have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> or
even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of verb forms.  The flexible nature of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> means that verbs can easily be based on names,
whereas in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latinate</ENAMEX> languages, with their many inflections,
such a process is clearly hampered.  Perhaps it is precisely
because our approach to the grammar of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is still
in many ways based on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> grammar that we do not have
a specific grammatical term for name-based verbs, and it
is time to give proper recognition to this feature.

            The dividing line between proper nouns (and proper
names) and common nouns-cum-eponyms is difficult to
define.  Nevertheless, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> key factors for classification
seem to be whether the name behind the verb is still relevant
to the meaning and whether a capital letter is used.
Such considerations are also pertinent to name-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adjectives</ENAMEX>.  There would appear to be no reason why the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of these defining factors cannot be applied equally
well to verbs, a boycott and to boycott could be labelled
hand-in-hand as eponymous noun and verb (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> Capt.
Boycott having been forgotten by everyone except the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etymologists</ENAMEX> and encyclopedists).  In the majority of cases,
however, the name is not irrelevant, and the capital is
usually kept.  Clearly, we need a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> category for those
verbs that still allude directly to the name and that are
consequently often written with a capital letter.  The only
proper term for such a category must be proper verb .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elementary</ENAMEX>, My Dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mendeleev</ENAMEX>




            The categorization of all the known elements of the
day by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dmitri Ivanovich</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mendeleev</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1834-1907</TIMEX>) represents an instance of genius
in nomenclature and classification.  Not only did Mendeleev
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">notice</ENAMEX> that the elements could be grouped together in a
chart that related their atomic numbers (the number of
neutrons in the nucleus of their base isotope), but he also
saw that this relationship grouped together elements with
similar chemical characteristics.  For instance, all the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">noble gases</ENAMEX> (neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon)
are arranged in a vertical row at the right-hand edge of
the table.

            However, just because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the same area of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> are related atomically and chemically, this neatness
is not necessarily reflected in the names, let alone
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-character symbols we have given to elements,
which reflect all the chaos, variety, whims, and even vanity
of history and human nature.

            Let us start with some of the more common elements,
however, as their etymology best illustrates the
complete arbitrariness in naming elements.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hydrogen ,</ENAMEX>
with atomic number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, is actually rather straightforward:
its name comes from easily recognized <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin</ENAMEX> roots for
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and create.  It is the most common element in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">universe</ENAMEX>, and it is the most common element in ordinary,
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">everyday water</ENAMEX>.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> it is called, very prosaically,
Wasserstoffe water stuff in recognition of its role as the
basic building block of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> has a number of other element names which
end in -stoffe: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kohlstoffe, Sauerstoffe</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stickstoffe</ENAMEX> being
the best known.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kohlstoffe</ENAMEX> is, of course, the stuff of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX>,
or charcoal.  Both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX> and c(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX>)ar come from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IE</ENAMEX> * ker ,
meaning charcoal.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sauerstoffe</ENAMEX> is not a reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Säuerkraut</ENAMEX> ,
but in a way that is not as crazy as it sounds: Säure
is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> word for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> is likewise the
stuff that makes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxy</ENAMEX> comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> oxus
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sharp < IE</ENAMEX> * ak , sharp and sour both being descriptive
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nitrogen</ENAMEX> is a little more complicated.  The word comes
from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">natron ash</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda</ENAMEX>.  What might have been
referred to was nitrogen's key role in creating nitrates and
other alkaline (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda</ENAMEX>-like) compounds.

            Alongside these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> most common elements--probably
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99 per cent</NUMEX> of all atoms in organic molecules are
either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen</ENAMEX>, or nitrogen--we should
consider some of the elements without which our standard
of living would be impossible: the base and precious
metals.  A group of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> metallic elements which were well
known to the ancients and which also have in common
symbols that do not resemble the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> words for
them are lead (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pb</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cu</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX>), silver
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Au</ENAMEX>).  The reason the symbols vary so
much from their names is that they are abbreviations of
names given them in ancient times.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercury</ENAMEX> , also called
quicksilver , is liquid at room temperature and thus
brought to mind the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX>-footed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> messenger god.
However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> also called the metal quicksilver;
in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, liquid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> is hydrárgyros , from which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symbol Hg</ENAMEX> derived.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Copper</ENAMEX> is from ME coper , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coper</ENAMEX>/copor , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Proto</ENAMEX>-Germanic
* <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">kupar</TIMEX> , and is called cuprum in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Late Latin</ENAMEX>;
both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proto-Germanic</ENAMEX> and Late <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> forms are from
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin Cyprium</ENAMEX> , the adjective for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cyprus</ENAMEX> , whence the best
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> came in antiquity, which goes back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX>,
who called it kupros .  Whereas both the name of the element
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and its universal symbol come from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cyprus</ENAMEX> , the name came via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germanic</ENAMEX> and the symbol
via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>.

            
               Lead is from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ME/OE</ENAMEX> lead , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germanic</ENAMEX> lauda , but
its ultimate origin is obscure.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> plumbum weight
gives us the symbol, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pb</ENAMEX> (along with words like plumb,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plumb bob</ENAMEX> , and plumber one who works with lead and
lead pipes.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Silver</ENAMEX> is from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">OE siolfor</ENAMEX>/seolfor , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Proto</ENAMEX>-Germanic
* <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">silubhra</TIMEX> , and may not be an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> word at all,
but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> borrowed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Semitic language</ENAMEX> Akkadian
(the language of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Babylon</ENAMEX>): <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sarpu</ENAMEX> refined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX>.  The
symbol, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag</ENAMEX>, comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> argentum , from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IE</ENAMEX> *arg,
meaning to shine, or white.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gold</ENAMEX> comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IE</ENAMEX> * ghel to shine but in
a yellow sense (in contrast to * arg , which is to shine in
a white sense).  This root, or closely related ones, such
as * ghol , yield a whole slough of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words
via various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proto-Germanic</ENAMEX> and related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IE</ENAMEX> roots: yellow,
gild, gall (a yellowish <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX>), choler, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cholera</ENAMEX>, melancholy
black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bile</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorine</ENAMEX> , all via <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> kholé yellow
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bile</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> chlidé luxury and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Proto</ENAMEX>-Germanic
* ghhleid and * glazem: gleam, glint, glimmer, glisten,
glass, glaze, gloss, glance, glade, glee, glow, gloaming,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glide</ENAMEX> , and glissade --quite a haul from what is basically
a single root!  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Au</ENAMEX> , comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> aurum
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, which, in turn, comes from Indo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>
* auso- gold, but possibly meaning to draw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, leading
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to speculate that ancient gold was found by panning,
as in placer mining.

            Finally, a group of odds `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">n</ENAMEX>' sods: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nickel</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">devil</ENAMEX>'s
metal), from modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">German Kupfernickel</ENAMEX> copper
demon: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nickel</ENAMEX> is a diminutive of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicklaus</ENAMEX> , similar to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English Old Nick</ENAMEX>, a term for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Devil</ENAMEX>, so called
because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nickel</ENAMEX> was considered a contaminant when found
in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper ore</ENAMEX> but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early days</TIMEX> of mining--as if the
metal were spooked.  Once a use had been found for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nickel</ENAMEX> (it is what makes stainless <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> stainless, among
other uses), it became a desirable metal; but its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ore</ENAMEX> was
found to have a gremlin in it, which turned out to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cobalt</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kobalt</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>).  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> word for gremlin
is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kobold</ENAMEX> , an underground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sprite</ENAMEX> believed to put
curses on ore.

            Although several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are spelled differently on
either side of the anglophone world ( caesium vs. cesium ,
for instance), only aluminium is both spelled and pronounced
differently.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aluminium</ENAMEX> is so spelled outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> (except by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> aluminum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aluminium</ENAMEX> ).  The metal was identified in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1808</TIMEX> by Sir
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humphry Davy</ENAMEX>, who originally named it alumium , based
on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> alumen , and alum , oxides and sulphates of
aluminum, respectively, which were known to the ancients.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Four years later</TIMEX>, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Davy</ENAMEX> changed his mind and
called the element <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX> , which he felt more closely
resembled the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin</ENAMEX> roots.  The word was transformed in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aluminium</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> because it seemed more classically
consistent.  There is another element--tungsten--which
used to be known as wolfram in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, although this has
been supplanted by tungsten .

            It is not considered proper to name elements after
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oneself</ENAMEX>, but others can name an element after you if you
are dead and sufficiently famous.  Or you could arrange
to have an element named after your <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hometown</ENAMEX> or your
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scandium, Polonium, Europium, Francium</ENAMEX>,
Americium, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germanium, Berkelium, Californium, Yttrium</ENAMEX> ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ytterbium</ENAMEX> , the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> being elements named after
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> where they were discovered.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Elements</ENAMEX>
named after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Curium, Mendelevium</ENAMEX>,
Einsteinium, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nobelium</ENAMEX> (actually this was named after
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nobel Institute</ENAMEX>, not directly after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alfred Nobel</ENAMEX>),
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrencium</ENAMEX> .  However, there is another element
whose nomenclature breaks the rules thanks to a trick its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">discoverer</ENAMEX> played on the world.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chemist Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran</ENAMEX> managed to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">name Gallium</ENAMEX> after himself (because, of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coq</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin</ENAMEX> is Gallus !).  As <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gallium</ENAMEX> is the only other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX>, besides
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercury</ENAMEX>, which is liquid at room temperature and since
liquid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX> have a slightly shady reputation, perhaps
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lecoq</ENAMEX>'s trick was poetically apt.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Logos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Speech) and Logos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Symbols</ENAMEX>)
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ägyptisches Museum</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>

            In the Beginning was the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Logos</ENAMEX>  ... and only much
later were there letters.  When and where humankind
made its first intelligible utterance will never be
known.  However, it was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only a mere 5,000</NUMEX> years
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo loquens</ENAMEX> hit upon writing down some of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Babelian</ENAMEX> babble around him--and there has been
no stopping him since!  Presumably, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sumerian</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accountants</ENAMEX>--no boob-bookkeepers they!--first substituted
signs for pictographs, giving them phonetic
instead of semantic values.  Literati of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> decided
they too could use these new-fangled marks for something
besides counting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cows</ENAMEX>, setting in motion another
logorrhoeic avalanche that has continued to snowball
ever since.  Speech and writing, as inextricably joined as
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>'s two surfaces, are different forms of the same,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">singular</ENAMEX> phenomenon distinguishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> from all
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> on earth.  Yet, while the garrulous gabble
continues everywhere, constant and unabated, writing
still eludes half the world's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> for whom marks
on any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> remain inscrutable, impenetrable,
indecipherable cryptography.

            Writing is a symbol of the sounds (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aristotle, Categories</ENAMEX> ).
But the discrepancies between language in its
spoken and written forms are often blatant.  The symbols
of any writing system have whatever phonetic value its users
agree to assign to them, convention and consensus playing
a major role.  For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>
confronted with the street sign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PED XING Efor</ENAMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time
have seriously believed in the imminent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinicization</ENAMEX> of contemporary
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX>.  The configuration 2 is
pronounced kaks(i), ketto, tin, rua, dua, lua, iki, xojor, mbili,
zole, shnayim , and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">roughly</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four to six thousand</NUMEX> other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> around the globe.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orthography</ENAMEX>'s quixotic,
chimerical vagaries, allowing such Cheshire-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> creations
as ghoti (= <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, courtesy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.B. Shaw</ENAMEX>) and Ghoughphthleightteeaux
(= <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX>; see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Firmage</ENAMEX>), are notorious.

            From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aristotle</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quintilian</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Saussure, Chomsky</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Francis</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinker</ENAMEX>--to name a few--man
has been studying <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than two millennia</TIMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> books of recent vintage reflecting this ongoing fascination
are:
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alphabet Abecedarium</ENAMEX>
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Story of Writing</ENAMEX>
            
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alphabet Abecedarium</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bibliophile</ENAMEX>'s answer
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">botanist</ENAMEX>'s stroll through the garden, being an eminently
enjoyable omnium gatherum of recondite, recherché,
and obscure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arcana</ENAMEX> and lore about the letters of our
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> alphabet written in a light, conversational, self-deprecatory,
tongue-in-cheek style.  After a brief history of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alphabet</ENAMEX>, each of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> succeeding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> is
devoted to a single letter, with a final <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX> discussing signs
and symbols.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Firmage</ENAMEX> recounts the development of each
letter from its first protoplastic attestation on through its
often protean metamorphoses over the millennia.

            In an engaging, wide-ranging display of erudition, Firmage
discusses the letters' symbological values in such
diverse parlances as chemistry, music, ancient and modern
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mysticism</ENAMEX> (including far too much New Age material
for my tastes), while quotes from such diverse figures
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rabelais, Dostoyevsky</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dylan</ENAMEX>--and Elmer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fudd</ENAMEX>--interlard the text.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Firmage</ENAMEX>'s main interest in this
pleasant potpourri is in aesthetics: the letters' shapes and
designs.  Extrapolating on the theories of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Geofroy Tory</ENAMEX>, as expounded in his <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Champ</ENAMEX> Fleury
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1529</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Firmage</ENAMEX> takes <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tory</ENAMEX>'s sketches as the springboard
for his analysis of the letter-shapes and the sometimes
highly stylized forms they assume throughout history,
from their inchoate inception in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Near East</ENAMEX> down to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">present-day</ENAMEX>, computer-generated typefaces.  Line drawings
alternate with explicative text.

            Quibbling additions and corrections: the mirrorreverse
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitaph</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 2</ENAMEX>) is anything but an illiterate endeavor,
the letter forms being quite standard, the contents entirely
normal.  Why the letters are reversed is a puzzling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enigma</ENAMEX>.

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-form god but a teratomorphic concoction of Gnostic
syncretistic fantasy.  The (mis)information (pp. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 183</TIMEX>)
that papyrus was costly is an undying canard.  After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a hundred</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of research and the publication of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> papyri
in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> languages the price of papyrus is simply
unknown, too many imponderabilia--quantity?  quality?
size?  amount?--plaguing the few references to a price.
Incredible profligacy--a few lines on otherwise pristine
sheets--and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of ancient tax receipts prove that
even the poorest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasant</ENAMEX> could pay for the papyrus on
which his payments were recorded.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scraping</ENAMEX> writing off
papyrus irreparably damages the surface; washing produces
only a smudge.  Errors were simply crossed out and written
over.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX> were the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Logos</ENAMEX>?  Taking a different
approach, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Story of Writing</ENAMEX> is almost coffee-table-sized;
it is elegantly designed and richly illustrated.
After presenting various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> of communication
(signs, pictographs, rebuses, shorthand, tallies, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Babylonian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay tokens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Peruvian</ENAMEX> quipus), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX> discusses
such ancient and now defunct but decipherable writing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sumerian</ENAMEX> cuneiform, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hieroglyphs</ENAMEX>,
Minoan <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> B, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> glyphs; ditto some
of the more outstanding conundra awaiting decipherment--Cretan
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear A</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proto-Elamite, Etruscan</ENAMEX>, and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Easter Island</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indus</ENAMEX> scripts.  The rest of the book
treats living languages and their scripts.

            From <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hieroglyphs to Alphabets--and Back?</ENAMEX>,  the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX>'s concluding chapter, is not an entirely
rhetorical question.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years ago</TIMEX> did those now
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ubiquitous</ENAMEX> and--depending on how one perceives them--
exuberantly eloquent or infuriatingly laconic logos begin
to appear on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> and street signs; in terminals (do
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kilted Scots</ENAMEX> or slacks-clad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> ever end up in the
wrong lavatories?); computer screen displays; and instruction
manuals for electr(on)ic gadgetry.  Similarly, architectural,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">musical</ENAMEX>, mathematical, astronomical, chemical
notation, dance and circuit diagrams are replete with symbols
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> place on a par with proto-scripts, implying
that after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5,000 years</TIMEX> of literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lucubrations</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scriveners</ENAMEX>' scribblings we are leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age</ENAMEX> of Writing
and entering a post-modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age of Logography</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Succinctly</ENAMEX> stated, the basic, underlying question is,
How do we (who use alphabets) read?  Conversely, how did
the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sumerians, Egyptians</ENAMEX>, and how do present-day
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Koreans</ENAMEX> read?  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Athanasius Kircher</ENAMEX>'s
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1602-1680</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph de Guignes</ENAMEX>' (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1721-1800</TIMEX>) fanciful
descriptions of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> signs and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> hieroglyphs
gave birth to the notion that these writing systems could
somehow circumvent pedestrian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">alphabets</ENAMEX>, going as it
were straight to the heart of things.  Since then the myth
has persisted that here encoded in these quasi-representational
forms was the quintessence of thought, the eternal
Platonic ideal, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jungian Ur</ENAMEX>- symbol underlying all
human cogitation--and by extrapolation, speech--the
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>)lure of the fabulous (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Far</ENAMEX>) East playing an obvious role.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linguistic</ENAMEX> research has proven, however, that such
notions are entirely false.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hieroglyphs</ENAMEX> and logographs are
just as much phonetic-based scripts as letters (which millennia
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX> were likewise pictorial representations of concrete
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">objects</ENAMEX>).  That hieroglyphs and logographs sometimes
contain significant visual elements--mnemonic aids to
jog the memory and set the synapses swinging--is icing
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> and foremost, hieroglyphs and logographs
are read as sounds, not symbols, as my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven-year</TIMEX> foray
into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> has taught me.  How the brain actually perceives
writing of any shape is a question spanning a wide
variety of disparate disciplines, cognitive sciences, (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">neuropsycho-</NUMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linguistics</ENAMEX> and -biology, the debate ongoing and
controversy-laden.  Visible speech, regardless whether
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alphabetic</ENAMEX> or logographic, with all its faults and foibles,
its inherent inconsistencies, inadequacies, and inaccuracies,
it seems, is here to stay.

Opportunities for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Misunderstanding the Police</ENAMEX>




            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and most vivid impressions after
becoming a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> was the exceptional
richness of police jargon.  It also struck me as odd,
in view of how inventive and amusing this jargon is, how
little is used for background colour in TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> dramas
and, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programme-makers</ENAMEX> use it at all, how often
they get it wrong.

            For instance, fictional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> are always talking about
their being in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force</ENAMEX> , whereas real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> never talk
about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> : it is always simply the job .  So an off-duty
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> stopped in a speed trap will try to escape by murmuring
to the traffic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>, I'm in the job, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX>, or perhaps
just I'm job.  When his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pals</ENAMEX> ask him about it they
will say, Were you in a job <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>?  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officers</ENAMEX> perennially
gripe about the abrasive and unsympathetic qualities of
job toilet paper .  Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house journal</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s largest
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Metropolitan Police</ENAMEX>, is called simply
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Job</ENAMEX> .

            Similarly, no real police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> has, in my hearing,
ever referred to his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> as either his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">manor</ENAMEX> or his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">patch</ENAMEX> , both terms being the norm in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> shows.
In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policemen</ENAMEX> always speak of their ground : an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>
might ask his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pal</ENAMEX>, Do you know a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pub</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhinoceros</ENAMEX>?
and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> will reply, Of course I do: it's
on my ground.  Returning from a foray outside his own
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">station</ENAMEX>'s area, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> will say to another, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ah</ENAMEX>, we're
back on the ground again.

            Another term much beloved of TV dramatists is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Super</ENAMEX> ,
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Superintendent</ENAMEX>, and its logical next step, Chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Super</ENAMEX> :
the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Super's</ENAMEX> on his way.  In reality, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> never abbreviate
this rank.  I've no idea why; they just don't.  It is always
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Superintendent</ENAMEX> or He's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Superintendent</ENAMEX> now.
In conversation, however, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Superintendent</ENAMEX> or Chief
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Superintendent</ENAMEX> in charge of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> is almost invariably
referred to as simply the guv'nor , and he and his entourage
of supervising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> down to and including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inspectors</ENAMEX>
are collectively the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> .  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspector</ENAMEX> running a
shift of operational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> is also the guv'nor .

            By contrast, no one, of any rank, ever addresses someone
of the rank of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constable</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constable</ENAMEX>: in direct
address he will simply be addressed by name or, in more
formal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contexts</ENAMEX>, by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">601</ENAMEX>, report to the Chief
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Superintendent</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> qualification review at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.00</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pm</ENAMEX>.  In indirect reference, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constables</ENAMEX> is
always referred to as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCs</ENAMEX> , mentioned individually in
such terms as He's a PC on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M Division</ENAMEX>, My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>'s in
the job: he's a PC at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wembley</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sergeants</ENAMEX> are addressed
from time to time as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarge</ENAMEX> , but much more usually as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skipper</ENAMEX>
or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skip</ENAMEX> ; and they are always referred to indirectly as
such: He's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skipper</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspectors</ENAMEX> and Chief
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspectors</ENAMEX> are never abbreviated or otherwise jargonized.
As for the most stratospheric ranks of all, ending with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> himself, they are known collectively as the
brass .

            The PCs are divided into reliefs , each working a rotation
of early, late, and night shifts.  Shift , however, is a word
that is not used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>: early and late duties are
known as early and late turn , but <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> are always night
duty or plain <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> .  Early turn is generally known colloquially
as early <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> , but the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> have no sobriquets.
Any single period of work is a tour (of duty) .  Before
your tour you get into your uniform, including your bonnet
(helmet--but never the flat cap used on motorized
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">patrol</ENAMEX>), your stick (truncheon, including the new American-style
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nightsticks</ENAMEX>), and your uniform jacket (not strictly
a jargon term, but another case of police-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> divide,
in that the public nearly always call it a tunic , which is
never used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> themselves).  You also put on
your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> personal radio.  At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time this was called the
Batphone , but that term has dropped out of use.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> where all this takes place is never
referred to as anything other than the nick .  That is also
the commonest of many names for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>, and the one
almost invariably used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>.  Anyone held in police
custody is banged up.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nick</ENAMEX> is the universal verb for the
act of arrest: the polite courtroom phrase I arrested and
cautioned him is almost invariably a euphemism for the
words actually spoken by PC to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX> on the street
are, You're nicked--suitably adverbially embellished if
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX> has caused the PC to run, fight, or lose his
breath.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX> is a body , as in Any mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> available
to so to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Trafalgar Square</ENAMEX> to pick up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">601</NUMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX>?  But
you never arrest a body, or even nick him: you always get
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> .  You may also feel his collar or, more commonly,
have him off , and if it is for anything other than drunkenness,
you get a crime knock .  Crime knocks often flow
from observations.  Here is another example of the TV
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> (and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>) getting it wrong: they always
refer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> as keeping an observation .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Police</ENAMEX>, on
the other hand, never say that, always doing an obbo .  One
thing, however, is certain: however he came to be arrested,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> is always thenceforward referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chummy</ENAMEX> .

            Many crimes are invariably referred to by initials,
some of which belong to offences that have been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-seded</ENAMEX>--a
good example of jargon's proving more tenacious
of life than the things from which it arises.  For example,
someone arrested for the offence of going equipped for
theft is still known by the initials of the old offence of carrying
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Breaking Implements</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larceny Acts</ENAMEX>, though they were repealed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades ago</TIMEX>.  Thus
I had him off for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBI</ENAMEX>.  You might also have him off for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Taking and Driving Away</ENAMEX>, now replaced by Taking
a conveyance ), or for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outraging Public</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Decency</ENAMEX>), IPO (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Impersonating</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Police Officer</ENAMEX>), or for
the better-known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABH</ENAMEX> or GBH (assaults occasioning
Actual or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Grievous Bodily Harm</ENAMEX>).  And there are many
others.

            If you have had someone off for some of the more
serious of these crimes it is likely that you will be in plain
clothes.  In that case you need to identify yourself as job
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chummy</ENAMEX>.  You do this by flashing your brief , which
means in practice waving under his nose a bit of plastic
that is actually your warrant card, but as far as Chummy
knows might be anything, and announcing that he's nicked.
When he gets to the nick he will then holler for a brief
of an entirely different kind, namely his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>--a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">solicitor</ENAMEX>;
and if the case goes as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, the brief will very
likely have engaged a mouthpiece --in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> a barrister,
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> a trial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>--to speak for him.

            Some crime knocks are wrongful, and sometimes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> have been known to arrest on sight someone they
feel sure is at it and decide later on what they have arrested
him for, sometimes even planting evidence.  This is known
in copspeak as being swift , or as swifting someone off for
whatever it is that is later decided upon.  Or you may tell
your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pals</ENAMEX> in the canteen later that you had him off under
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> [or whichever] <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Division Breathing Act</ENAMEX> or under the
Refusal of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Particulars Act</ENAMEX> .  More frequent is the custom
of claiming that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chummy</ENAMEX> said something self-incriminating
on arrest.  This is known as verballing him up .  Any
such behaviour is often described as bent , as in bent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> ,
but among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> themselves the common term for
such an arrest is, I see old so-and-so got well and truly
stitched up for theft from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX>.  This is yet another
case where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> and public part <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>: the media
always talk of bent police fitting up innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrestees</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> never use that term, always stitch up .  The
term fit up was, as far as I can ascertain, coined by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">novelist G.F. Newman</ENAMEX> in his story of a bent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detective</ENAMEX>,
Sir<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">, You Bastard</ENAMEX> , but it is the one that has caught on, at
the expense of the real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> term.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police officer</ENAMEX> caught going bent will get into trouble.
Whether or not he ends up in court, he will certainly
be the subject of internal disciplinary proceedings.  He will
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">describe</ENAMEX> himself, however, as having been stuck on , this
being short for stuck on the dab .  Or he may use the other
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> for his abbreviation and say, I'm going on the dab
for this.  The term comes from the word dabs fingerprints,
which are taken from a prisoner by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> only after arrest
for fairly serious crime.  And an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> who has been stuck
on may well be heard lamenting that It's all gone pearshaped --which
is what happens when anything that
should have a fine, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> shape sags, with all the stuffing
leaking down into the bottom and flopping outwards.

            Having initially been stuck on, the errant PC will
soon receive the official form warning him that he may
be subject to disciplinary proceedings.  Like all large
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bureaucracies</ENAMEX>, the police flounder in an ocean of paper,
with a form for every action.  The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for this warning of
possible discipline is a Form No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">163</NUMEX>, so the PC can now
say of himself, I've been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">'d</ENAMEX>; and a bit later,
when the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> assigned to investigate the complaint
decides that there is enough evidence to justify a
hearing (which he always does), comes the even more
dreaded next stage, I've been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-foured --i.e.,
given notice of the date of the disciplinary hearing.

            You can be stuck on for anything from serious misconduct
to minor infringements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">police</ENAMEX>'s absurdly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">draconian</ENAMEX> and catch-all disciplinary codes, which make it
possible for a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> with a grudge against a junior
to stick him on for almost anything.  For example, the PC
may have been caught slipping unobtrusively into a restaurant
or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pub</ENAMEX> on his ground to scrounge--otherwise ponce
or mump --a drink or a meal.  Every PC cultivates his own
special places for this purpose: they are his own preserve
and forbidden to other PCs; he will refer to them as his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ponce</ENAMEX>-holes , and they add greatly to the sum of constabular
happiness.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mine</ENAMEX> included the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savoy Hotel</ENAMEX>.)

            Other things for which one might go on the dab
include scrounging provender from markets, the produce
being known as codgel ; associating with the wrong kind
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, which is to say actions like boozing with
known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX>, or CRO <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRO</ENAMEX> stands for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Criminal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Records Office</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> itself has been given an
impressive new name, but the old initials survive it.)  So
I might talk of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> with criminal convictions as
your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mates</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Police</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> again: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> shows
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> always describe these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of yours as
having form .  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> always talk of previous .  Having
either, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chummy</ENAMEX> will of course have a docket number at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRO</ENAMEX> or its computerized replacement; any police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>,
however, will still say Well, well, well!  He's got a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> number
!
            

            Having nicked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chummy</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> may wish to
search his property for the proceeds of his crimes.  If he
refuses his permission for them to do so, they will get a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> (warrant) from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magistrate</ENAMEX> or, in some parts, a Panel
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">experts bench</ENAMEX> of lay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justices</ENAMEX>.  Then they will go and
give his drum a spin , or just spin him search his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>.
Whether or not they find anything, they will eventually
get into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-blues civilian jacket over job shirt and trousers
and go off to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pub</ENAMEX> for a well-earned pint; and if you
eavesdrop on their conversation, since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policemen</ENAMEX> always
talk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>, you will undoubtedly overhear some of the
expressions you have been introduced to here.

            Turns of Phrase




            How long is it since you turned round and gave someone
a good earful?  And did he or she turn round and give
as good as they got?

            You might turn round to me and say you don't know
what I'am on about.  In which case I am liable to turn round
to you and say, Of course you do.  Open your ears.

            But beware.  You may find this particular speech habit
to be like the creaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> outside the window: it was
always there but you never heard it.  Once you hear it you
scarcely hear anything else.

            Why do we twist and spin before we speak?  Is it a
ritual?  a spell to ward off contradiction?  a dance of self-justification?
Certainly, it usually carries some hint of
aggression, and, as always, vindication is in the mouth of
the utterer.

            If you turn round and do it to me, it probably means
you are being duplicitous in some way--switching allegiance;
reversing an opinion.  A turncoat, perhaps.  She
turned round and told me she always knew I had the
dress sense of a bag-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>.

            We might term this <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Turning Round</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Offering</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bare-faced Cheek</ENAMEX>.  The orbiting full moon, perhaps.

            Consumer grievances are particularly rich in these
audacious revolutions.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Retailers</ENAMEX> seem to turn round wholesale
on their hapless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> with outrageous demands.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gas Board</ENAMEX> turned round and said I had to pay for
their cock-up.  This is called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Turning Round and Moving</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goalposts</ENAMEX>.

            If, on the other hand, I turn round and do it to you,
it probably means that I am turning in heroic defiance,
wheeling in righteous indignation, turning on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tormentors</ENAMEX>.
I turned round and told them I wasn't going to
take it lying down.  This is known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turning Round</ENAMEX> and
Standing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">One's Ground</ENAMEX>.

            The average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>'s listening to talk radio will provide
a vertiginous selection of all these categories--plus, of
course, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Political Revolution</ENAMEX>.  That is not, as previously
thought, the overthrow of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faction</ENAMEX> by another but
describes those occasions when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> reverses his
position while claiming consistency of stance.

            That is called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Turning Round and Steering a Steady</ENAMEX>
Course and appears on Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spin Doctor</ENAMEX>'s
Manual.

            The pièce-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de-résistance</ENAMEX> of the rotating phrase, however,
came when my own step-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> told me of an
aggravated duet (or should that be roundelay?)  between
herself and her habitual sparring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>.  After an epic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of personal pirouettes she delivered the knockout
punch with the following:

            I told her to her face, [an aberrant piece of straight-talking,
this] Don't you turn round to me and tell me I
turned round and accused you of being <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-faced.  Thus
creating, in the true sense of the term, a circular argument.
Dizzying stuff, eh?

         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Intrusive s</ENAMEX>




            The letter s sometimes appears at the end of a word
to which it does not properly belong.  Examples are a little
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX>, anyways , and somewheres .  This usage is commonly
heard in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, chiefly from country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX>, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>.  The earliest use I have found is dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 April 1806</TIMEX>,
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Clark</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clark Journal</ENAMEX>,
wrote, a long ways off.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> in newspapers, and especially
in advertising, one often reads (and hears) a savings
of and, increasingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daylight Savings Time</ENAMEX> .

            Sometimes it appears that one s is suggested by another.
Thus we hear for heaven's sakes , and for goodness' sakes .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Ross</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> ,
was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stickler</ENAMEX> for details of grammar, punctuation, and
usage.  But he is quoted as saying, For God's sakes.

            The intrusive s frequently makes its way into place
names.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> on which I live, properly <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lyons Plain</ENAMEX>
Road , is often called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lyons Plains Road</ENAMEX>.  A nearby town
is commonly called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Greens Farms</ENAMEX>; it is my guess that Mr.
Green had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX>.  For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years</TIMEX> I spent the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">winters</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gun Green Farm</ENAMEX> .
Something like one in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> letters from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> were
addressed to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gun Green Farms</ENAMEX>.  An example I particularly
like is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smiths College</ENAMEX> .

            The addition of an s to a place name seems to be
largely an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> habit.  But the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> have also played
their part.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, rather more than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> finds an s tacked on to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> names Marseille
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lyon</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marsales</ENAMEX> is in fact the commonly heard
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pronunciation</ENAMEX>.  Even the good edition of the Encyclopaedia
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britannica</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1911</TIMEX>) gives the entry <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LYONS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fr. Lyon</ENAMEX> ) and uses
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyons</ENAMEX> throughout the text except when giving a name, such
as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lyon</ENAMEX> main line .  The heading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MARSEILLES</ENAMEX> is given
with no reference to the spelling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marseille</ENAMEX> , except when
reproducing similar names or as a place of publication.

            
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times Atlas of the World</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX>) does better; in
the gazetteer it gives <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, see <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lyon</ENAMEX>, and
Marseilles, see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marseille</ENAMEX>.  In the map of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> it gives
the proper spelling, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> in parentheses below.
In a full-page article in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York Times</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 26</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, What's doing in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Greenhouse</ENAMEX> uses
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyons</ENAMEX>'s throughout, though using <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lyon</ENAMEX> in a
name, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bistrot de Lyon</ENAMEX> .  At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point he writes,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyons</ENAMEX>, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> spell <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lyon</ENAMEX>.

            Newspaper accounts of sporting events commonly
refer to the finals.  There are, of course, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">quarter</NUMEX>-finals and
semi-finals, but only one final.  Let me report that more
than once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>, I was wished a Happy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</TIMEX>'s ,
though I am sure that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> were wishing me to be
happy for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than one day</TIMEX>.

            Recently I read <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Treason in the Blood</ENAMEX> , a book about
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philbys</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houghton Mifflin</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Cave Brown</ENAMEX>.  The subject greatly interested me;
but my faith in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> was shaken on the very first
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">page</ENAMEX>, by his misquotation from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blake</ENAMEX>, And did those feet
in ancient times ... I was less surprised by an advertisement
of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfit</ENAMEX> that offered visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> summer
courses at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">misquoting</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> ... whispering from her towers the last
enchantments of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</TIMEX>.  This horror, ruining
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold</ENAMEX>'s lovely rhythm, actually appears in that otherwise
admirable book, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oxford Dictionary of Quotations</ENAMEX> .

            Finally, I hope I may be forgiven, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>,
for citing my favorite example, a book called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manuscript</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proof</ENAMEX> , published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford University Press</ENAMEX>.
My copy, carefully preserved, has the jacket, twice proclaiming
the title as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuscript</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proofs</ENAMEX> .
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Game</ENAMEX> of the Name




            Being born of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Midlands</ENAMEX> and
spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early years</TIMEX> of my life there, having a name
like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Thorpe</ENAMEX> never really gave me any problems.
The countryside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lincolnshire</ENAMEX> and Leicestershire
abounds with village names that end with thorpe and,
apart from being called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thorpy</ENAMEX> by my school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pals</ENAMEX>, the
name never caused any difficulty.  That was before I
started travelling.  It was then that I found out just how
tough it is for most nationalities to get their tongues
round the dreaded <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">th</NUMEX>.  Even when I started working in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> I had to accept a fair number of Mista Forps
in the course of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an average day</TIMEX>.

            It is not surprising that my first exposure to non-Brits
was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, where I soon reconciled myself to
a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gallic</ENAMEX> attack on my personal hygiene when they
insisted on addressing me as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miss</ENAMEX> Your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soap</ENAMEX>, subtly
intoned, I always thought, with an interrogatory inflexion.
Later, on many visits to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, I reluctantly submitted
to the title of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hair Torpor</ENAMEX>, an uncanny
prediction of what was to befall my then luxuriant
growth.  Italians mostly managed with a cheerful Seen
Your Top, which surprised me because I was taller
than most of those I had to deal with.  My <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> contact
used to call me simply <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zorrp</ENAMEX>, which I found
pretty much to the point, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX>
settled for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trope</ENAMEX>.  Only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX> did I find
someone who truly tried to get it right, but the effort
involved putting his tongue out at me and concluded
with an overly explosive final consonant; but he got all
the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> in there.

            My travels in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> demonstrate a much more sensible
approach by the wily <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX>, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> most of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> have, without invitation, settled
for the easy to deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mister John</ENAMEX>.

            Strange to say, it is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> that one of the really
weird aural hiccups occurs.  It usually happens in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>
or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> or any of the other places where professional
name <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">takers</ENAMEX> are found.  The conversation usually
goes something like this:


Good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, sir.  Could I have your name please?

Yes, I'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Thorpe</ENAMEX>.

OK, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philips</ENAMEX>, I've put your name on the list.

No, no.  My name is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thorpe</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thorpe</ENAMEX>.

Oh! Sari! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yewer Jarn Thorwup</ENAMEX>.  Gee, I'm sari.

            

            Now that conversation may sound unbelievable, but in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> I have been renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX> dozens of times, on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West</ENAMEX> coast, particularly.  So often, in fact, that I have been
forced to assume the new identity of the more acceptable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarn Thorwup</ENAMEX> when dealing with any of the name takers
so deeply entrenched in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> way of doing
things.  How can they hear it that way?  It is not as though
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thorpe</ENAMEX> is that unusual a name in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>: after all, one
of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> of all time was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Thorpe</ENAMEX>, and they
even named a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> after him.  To be honest though, I think
I would rather be a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zorrp</ENAMEX> than a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX>.

            What is the ruling logic behind abbreviations?  Of
course, they should be shorter than what they stand for,
or why use them?  But they should also be quickly decodable
for the original words, and that is not always the
case.  For example, does ct. mean count or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>?  It can
mean either.  Or take the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in which I live, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX>:
should that be abbreviated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MS</ENAMEX> , or is that for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>?
Or if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>, what is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX>, and if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX>
is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MN</ENAMEX> (try again), what is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX>?  A few bouts of this
will make your head spin.

            And then, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">abbreviations</ENAMEX> have unsuspected
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">depths</ENAMEX>, or at least possibilities I had never entertained.  I
have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> who stands words on their
heads.  She is bright, articulate, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years old</TIMEX>.  Why
are some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Beloved</ENAMEX>?  She asked me the other
day.

            What do you mean?  I asked--my usual response
to one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>'s queries.

            Right there, she said, pointing to the lettering on
a map that read <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Blvd</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>, that's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boulevard</ENAMEX> , not Beloved , I objected,
but feebly.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>'s readings are often more interesting
than the conventional interpretation.

            She turned her serious gray-eyed gaze full on me.
How can you tell?

            Context, I replied with all the adult stiffness I could
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">muster</ENAMEX>, and that seemed to convince her.  But since then,
she has me wondering.  Why do so many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> end in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX> --<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Elm St.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Main St.</ENAMEX>?  What about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bulldog</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manger</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bldg</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mgr</ENAMEX>. in rear) I see listed in apartment
blocks?  How does a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> fit in an envelope (Ms.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enclosed</ENAMEX>)?

            From there, it is a short route to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phony Doctors</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ph.D.s</ENAMEX>) and municipal twerps (Now entering <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monroe</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twp</ENAMEX>.).  But maybe I had better <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stop</ENAMEX> here before I lose
all central ( ctrl .).

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC of Broadcasting Australian</ENAMEX>




            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broadcaster</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian Broadcasting</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>], has had advice on its use of English
for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX>.  The advising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, the
Standing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee on Spoken English</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOSE</ENAMEX>], has in
recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> been made up of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> categories of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broadcasters</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>]; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">facilitators</ENAMEX>];
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguistic experts</ENAMEX>]; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the
wider <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> is generally held in
high regard but ran aground when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of the
outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> resigned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX>.

            Their action raises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> questions.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is a general
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>: what sort of standardisation or regulation does
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> expect or tolerate in the language its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">broadcasters</ENAMEX>
use?  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is more local and specific to the
set of circumstances pertaining in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>: why does a committee
which has had a useful and influential life for more
than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty years</TIMEX> suddenly reach a crisis point at which a
significant proportion of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are prepared to
gamble on an incoming General <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Manager</ENAMEX>'s reassessment
of its role and put at risk its very existence?

            To take the general question <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, let us begin with
a little history.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOSE</ENAMEX> began its life in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pronunciation</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advisory Committee</ENAMEX>.  It was concerned with
the maintenance of standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> pronunciations as
those then believed to be most suitable for broadcasting.
Standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> meant the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, and in this
outpost of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>, announcers (though unseen) wore
dinner suits to read the news and abided by the rulings
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phonetician</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Jones</ENAMEX>, whose tremendously
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">influential English Pronouncing Dictionary</ENAMEX> was
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX>.  Enter a young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> phonetician,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Mitchell</ENAMEX>, later to become the founding
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice-Chancellor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macquarie University</ENAMEX>, and in that
capacity to appoint <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Delbridge</ENAMEX>, later to become
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Editor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Macquarie Dictionary</ENAMEX> , as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macquarie</ENAMEX>'s
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> of English and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linguistics</ENAMEX>.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1952</TIMEX>, on the
recommendation of an internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> set up to consider
the desirability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s making some departure
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> practice, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standing Committee on Pronunciation</ENAMEX>
was established to (and the wording is historic)
advise the Corporation on the most acceptable
pronunciation of those words for which [the] current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pronunciation</ENAMEX> differs from the pronunciation
recorded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Jones</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> was named the
Standing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee on Spoken English</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitchell</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Delbridge</ENAMEX> being successive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairmen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOSE</ENAMEX> during
its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">formative years</TIMEX>.

            Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> has vigilantly assessed
its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>, several times reviewing its aims and procedures
(in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971, 1983, 1987</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>).  Its revised terms of reference
are: to advise the Corporation on its use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spoken</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in broadcasting, with special reference to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pronunciation</ENAMEX>, grammatical usage, and style; and to prepare
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>, in electronic or print form, such specialised
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guides</ENAMEX> to the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, or other languages
as necessary.  Its primary goal has been the provision of
expert advice to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broadcasters</ENAMEX>--on the pronunciation of
names, place names, foreign words, words from specialist
vocabularies as various as music and sport, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>, etc.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Daily</TIMEX> lists of words that are likely to
give a broadcaster the conniptions are constantly being
added to a huge database which is electronically available
to all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">broadcasters</ENAMEX>.

            Nor has the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> shirked the responsibility
thrust on it by the public or avoided public controversy.
It has taken on (over the pronunciation of kilometre) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>'s
most loquacious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gough Whitlam</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fearlessly</ENAMEX> determined an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> pronunciation
of words as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Jervis Bay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chernobyl</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Quixote</ENAMEX>.
It has developed and sustained a public role for itself, as
its numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondents</ENAMEX> will testify.  It has watched
over and, in a very low-key way, guided the development
of a recognisable and accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> standard.  It has
not been without influence on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX>.
It seems reasonable to assume that it is valued by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>.

            Where a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> can lose its way, no matter how
intrinsically valuable its deliberations, is in its communication
with its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> (or should-be users).  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> problem
is the receptivity of a new generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broadcaster</ENAMEX> that
thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOSE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ivory-towerish</ENAMEX> and its recommendations
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">arcane</ENAMEX> and irrelevant in a world where information matters
more than its expression.  A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> has been the maintenance
of a communicating mechanism within the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organisation</ENAMEX>, which has been dependent on support from
within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s management structure.  In its heyday
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOSE</ENAMEX> was chaired by one of the academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>,
which gave it a certain impartiality and independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>,
and the circulation of its findings was the responsibility
of a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> and a trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX>-cum-research
assistant who was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servant</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> and who
reported to that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>.  Most recently it has been chaired
by a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>, alternately the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radio</ENAMEX> (who
has rarely been able to attend meetings), and the Head
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TV</ENAMEX> (who attended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> meeting out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX>).  Both
professed their whole-hearted support for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOSE</ENAMEX> (as did
the then General <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Manager</ENAMEX>, who attended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one Christmas</TIMEX>
party), but neither has been able to deliver.  This has left
the research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> on her own, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOSE</ENAMEX> effectively
if unintentionally emasculated.  But perhaps the revolution
is over and the new generation is in the right.

            Many thanks for the very kind gift of the number
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> containing the long and very amusing article
on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter W. Skeat</ENAMEX> [The
(invariably) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Right Reverence Walter W. Skeat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,16</NUMEX>].  From what I was told <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years ago</TIMEX>, he was constantly
deluged with letters from complete strangers
demanding to be told the etymology of various words,
and I am not at all surprised that he should have shown
irritation with those who had not even taken the elementary
steps of consulting either his own dictionary or
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N.E.D .</ENAMEX>  These, however, were the easy ones and could
be answered very briefly.  When asked for the derivation
of a word of which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">etymology</ENAMEX> had not been worked
out, he adopted a rationing system: he did the best he
could with the resources available in his study in the space
of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half an hour</TIMEX>.  The result was then communicated to
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX>, whose letter would then be dropped
into the wastepaper basket!

            This was necessary because otherwise his work would
have brought to a standstill.

            Of course personal acquaintances were not treated
in such a cavalier fashion, and he must have accumulated
an enormous correspondence, virtually none of which has
survived, except for his letters from Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Murray</ENAMEX>, who
with great presence of mind, on hearing of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX>'s
death, recovered the letters which he had sent him.
Both sides of this lifetime correspondence are now in the
possession of his granddaughter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss K. M. E. Murray</ENAMEX>,
who has made arrangements in her will to bequeath them
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bodleian</ENAMEX>.

            Apart from these, all his vast correspondence seems
to have been destroyed, apart from a few stray items
which have descended to me.  I say destroyed because I
recall having been told <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years ago</TIMEX> that after his death
his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> (my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX>) spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> tearing
up old letters.





         
         


            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Adams</ENAMEX> writes [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXII,2</NUMEX>] of the much-celebrated
Stoat as if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heironymous</ENAMEX> were still anonymous.  I am astonished
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX> has been unaware of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoat</ENAMEX>'s new career.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoat</ENAMEX> has been profiled several times in Tqydrtk
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magazine</ENAMEX> , among other places.  In those articles, he spoke
of his frustration with words inevitably creating meaning
in the minds of literate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> and his search for an audience
neither literate nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>.  Possibly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cardiff</ENAMEX> has been
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spared MTV</ENAMEX>, but we haven't.  The idea that words strung
together will inevitably make some sort of sense and conjure
connections in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>'s mind has been vanquished
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTV</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoat's insight</ENAMEX> was to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX> words without apparent
meaning to video images that move so rapidly and have
so little intrinsic activity (as opposed to action, of which there
is plenty) that no one can imagine what they're about.
There is no time for reflection and savoring, no desire to
be bombarded again.  Nouns are often paired, but in ways
that guarantee incomprehension.  For instance, in one of
his famous videos, a haddock (or some other large <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>) was
on the screen for a moment while a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vocalist</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ] sang about
a light bulb.  Now, of course, we have been given the key
to this complicated metaphor.  Thanks for enlightening us.

            I hope Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX> will explore this oeuvre and see
how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can take random words sung to apparently random
music and accompany them by random images.  Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoat</ENAMEX> has successfully broached the barricades of words.





         
         

            Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Champlin</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">On Good Terms</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXII</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 11</ENAMEX>] might
be interested to know that in this part of the world, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manchester</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">market town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altrincham</ENAMEX>, a custom
called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Beating the Bounds</ENAMEX> takes place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Boundary stones</ENAMEX> have taken the place of merestones .  They
may be set in a wall or be part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> or some such
construction.  I have attended the ceremony, which takes
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> and involves crossing the local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> by
boat since that is where the boundary crosses.

            I have a letter from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steward</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notary</ENAMEX> to the
Barony of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunham Massey</ENAMEX> (constituted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Baron</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamon de Massey</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Conquest</ENAMEX>), giving
me the script which is read at the start of the Beating the
Bounds.  Once young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> had their heads bumped on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">merestones</ENAMEX> to make them remember exactly where the
boundaries of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parish</ENAMEX> lay!  Now one of the members
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altrincham Court</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leet</ENAMEX> takes a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of willow and
swishes it against the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> occurring along the route.

            Beating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bounds</ENAMEX> was intended to establish boundaries
at a time when accurate maps were not available.
The bumping of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>' heads had to be suffered even when
the merestones were thrown into dividing streams or
ponds.

            There is a great deal of history attached to this practice.
I took some photos at various stages along the route
when I walked with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leet</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half a dozen</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX> dressed in mediaeval robes.





         
         

            I enjoyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Major</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Catalogue of Cats</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXII,2</NUMEX>]
very much.  In it he refers to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1785</TIMEX> edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Captain</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Grose</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</ENAMEX> .  I wonder
if Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Major</ENAMEX> is aware of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">1811 dictionary,  A Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buckish Slang</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Wit</ENAMEX>, and Pickpocket
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eloquence</ENAMEX> , which appeared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grose</ENAMEX>'s
death and which is presumably an expansion of the original
work.  It was reprinted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bibliophile Books</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">33 Maiden Lane</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Covent Garden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> WC2E <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7JS</TIMEX>.  It's
a great read and has the following <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>-derived words and

            In his final paragraph, Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Major</ENAMEX> says that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s hair

term that all male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> will be familiar with.  I never
encountered that: we used to refer to it as bum fluff !

            Incidentally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> name for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> is meow .





         
         


            In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> you printed a letter from me regarding
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Stough</ENAMEX>'s article, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Insulting Nicknames Give Journalists</ENAMEX>
Something to Be Proud of [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXI,4</NUMEX>].  In that letter
I gave my own recollection of a popular satirical summary
of the nicknames of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and asked if
other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> might be able to come up with more complete
and accurate versions.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> have, in fact,

            I read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Douglas Dirks</ENAMEX>'s review of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Professor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spevack</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare Thesaurus</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>], in the comfort
of the little village <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pub</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stalham Green</ENAMEX> here in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norfolk</ENAMEX>.  (If the camera had worked properly, you would
be able to recognise VERBATIM on the table beside my pint.)
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pub</ENAMEX> is named after a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> common in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broads</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grey heron Ardea</ENAMEX> cinerea , known locally as the harnser .
We do not mistake it for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawk</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">plasterer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> with
a handle underneath (called, interestingly enough, oiseau
in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>).  On the other hand, we do not use it to cut
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wood</ENAMEX>.  Our forebears used to hunt it with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hawks</ENAMEX>, and they
could easily distinguish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quarry</ENAMEX>.

            I was taught at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hamlet</ENAMEX> was referring to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">falconry</ENAMEX> when he explained to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horatio</ENAMEX> that he was but
mad north-northwest.  This seems more likely than a punning
comparison of tools which His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Highness</ENAMEX> is
unlikely to have used.  Besides, what other kind of saw
would he (or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>) have known, power tools then
being in their infancy?  Could the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">foot-lathe</NUMEX> have been
adapted as a footsaw?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H. Kirke Swann</ENAMEX>, in his <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of English and Folk-Names</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Birds</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Witherby and Co.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1913</TIMEX>, republished
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gale Research Company</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>), gives
Hern, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hernshaw, Hernseugh, Hernsew, Harn, Harnser</ENAMEX> , and
Harnsey as names for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grey</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heron</ENAMEX>.  The
last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East Anglian</ENAMEX>.  All are derived from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> heronceaux young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">heron</ENAMEX>, which itself descends
from heroncel , an Old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> diminutive.

            There are a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> words in common use
here in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX> (of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>).  The cloth with which
mine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wally</ENAMEX> mops the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> as we discuss that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
mag of yours is called a dwile , from toile .  We use towels
in the course of our toilet (and in the toilet, too), but
dwiles are found in bars and kitchens all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norfolk</ENAMEX>.

            Goo ye well together, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wally</ENAMEX> says to the company
at closing time.





         
         


            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosemary Bowmer</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">XXII, 2, 9</ENAMEX>] says that a rod was
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a half yards</NUMEX> when she started <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>.  I was taught
that <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five and a half yards</NUMEX> made up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> rod, pole, or perch;
thus, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four rods equalled twenty-two yards</NUMEX>, the length of
a <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">cricket</ENAMEX> pitch, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> times that made a furlong, and there
were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> furlongs to a mile.  Of course, these measurements
were used by unlettered and ignorant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX>,
who had no schooling; nowadays, when education continues
till well into adult life, even to pensionable age, counting
is done, as it were, on the fingers--metric, I believe, that
it is called.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Millar</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ibid.</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>] says there cannot have been so
many smiths in olden times.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> does not necessarily
refer to a blacksmith but to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>, possibly in metal
( smite , as in beating with a hammer or such?).  <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gold</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">White</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Silver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Copper</ENAMEX>, and<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">.</ENAMEX>, as in the case of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX>,
Tyresmith, by trade, not by name.





         
         
            [Undoubtedly changes in the values of measurements can
be attributed to inflation.]
         
         


            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Macintosh</ENAMEX>'s anecdote about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workman</ENAMEX> whose conversation baffles the visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frenchwoman</ENAMEX>
[XXII<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX>] makes the unwarranted assumption that
the common speech of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> Lowlands
is an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> dialect.  The subject has been debated
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least four centuries</TIMEX> but, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>
must be aware, a body of evidence suggests that the
Scots tongue has many of the characteristics of a distinct
language.

            As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mairie Robinson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor-in-chief</ENAMEX> of The Concise
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Scots Dictionary</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aberdeen University Press</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>), points
out in her Introduction, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scots</ENAMEX> is more strongly differentiated
from Standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> than any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
regional dialects in the number of words, meanings of
words and expressions not current in Standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>,
in its strikingly different pronunciation, and in the loyal
affection with which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> continue to
embrace it.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scots</ENAMEX> is not a corruption of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scots</ENAMEX> and modern <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> evolved in parallel from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, with importations from many other languages.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scot</ENAMEX> in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MacIntosh</ENAMEX>'s story is looking for his

            My reference is to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">All in the Family</ENAMEX>. by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Betts</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>].  The most aptly named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> I have
ever encountered was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX> who, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early in this century</TIMEX>,
had his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netwark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>.  His name was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Treat Paine</ENAMEX>.  In the same <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, during the same
period, there was a dining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> called The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celibate Restaurant</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> were not at all
interested in the sexual practices of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> and,
indeed, hoped only to cater to the many yet single people
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.





         
         
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea of Words</ENAMEX>
            This dictionary was published too late for me.  I
became a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick O'Brian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX> and fifteen
(of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seventeen</ENAMEX>) volumes ago.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O'Brian's</ENAMEX> is a roman fleuve
recounting the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1790-1815</TIMEX> continuing adventures of his
ship <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain hero</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Aubrey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Navy</ENAMEX>, and of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aubrey</ENAMEX>'s
best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Maturin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">naturalist</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>.  The enthusiasm of the public
for these volumes has increased exponentially with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">encomiums</ENAMEX> like, The best sea stories, and then, The
best historical novels ever written.  There are fan clubs
now all over the world for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX>.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlton Heston</ENAMEX>
is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>.)  For non-epopts:
reading these is like reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Austen</ENAMEX>--with
every so often a hellish sea battle or shipwreck.

            In order to enjoy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Brian</ENAMEX>'s novels, I have read them
with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammond Atlas</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> at the other.  That is tedious.  Had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea of</ENAMEX>
Words been published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, I would have been most
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grateful</ENAMEX>.  Anyone would have needed lexicographic succor.
Such words as limicole, catharping, xebec, siriasis --
as well as boxing the compass, the sails of a full rigged
ship, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>, deadeyes, shrouds, halyards, and stays, are
all well explained in this book, including pictures of how
a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>--rigged warship had its sails raised, lowered, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tacked</ENAMEX>, an incredibly complicated and difficult procedure.
Maps and diagrams of engagements are included.
At the back is a bibliography of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of other Napoleonic
era sea stories by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>.

            As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>, I can usually find errors in a lay
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s medical orientation, but not with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Brian</ENAMEX>!  The
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only</NUMEX> thing that I have not been able to find in medical
dictionaries, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> , or even in A <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sea of Words</ENAMEX> , is his
use of the word marthambles , which remains unknown to
me.

            If every enthusiastic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick O'Brian</ENAMEX> buys
a copy of this book, it will be a best-seller.  As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiast</ENAMEX>,
I would recommend the purchase.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feminist Stylistics</ENAMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three decades</TIMEX> after the reawakening of feminism, no
field of scholarship remains unexamined by feminist analysis,
a process rhetorician <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gay D. Claiborne</ENAMEX> has defined
as an effort to deconstruct the patterns of thinking that
lead to a world-view of reality as consisting of oppositional,
hierarchically-ordered pairs of things.  As they
seek to undo the masculine/feminine, self/other, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>/
reader splits, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claiborne</ENAMEX>, feminist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>...
work at an elevated political level of grave potential
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX>, for feminist involvement focuses on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foundation</ENAMEX> of cultural paradigms constructed by socially
sanctioned ways of thinking.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gay D. Claiborne</ENAMEX>, pp.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">143--44</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Rhetoric</ENAMEX>: A Contrastive
Study , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Scholars Publications</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>.)

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feminist Stylistics</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sara Mills</ENAMEX> challenges socially
sanctioned ways of thinking as she confronts the politics
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX>-use <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> on.  Noting that language is not simply
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> for ideas, but rather a material entity which
may in fact shape those ideas, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX> states that a further
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aim</ENAMEX> of feminist analysis is to draw attention to and change
the way that gender is represented, since it is clear that
a great many of these representational practices are not
in the interests of either <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.  Her book establishes
a framework for such analysis designed both to
describe sexism in a text and, through a process she names
feminist stylistics, to deconstruct the way in which point
of view, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, metaphor, and other features of the text
are unexpectedly closely related to matters of gender.

            For lay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who are not familiar with
the prevailing concepts of mainstream <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguistics</ENAMEX>, stylistics,
and literary analysis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX>'s Introduction provides a
helpful explication of current theories and positions in these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disciplines</ENAMEX>.

            The opening chapters address such questions as
whether meaning can exist in a text itself or is more the
result of a negotiation between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> and text; whether
male writing can be distinguished from female writing in
terms of formal linguistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX>; and how gender
interacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> positioning, that is, the ways a text
addresses and identifies its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX>, a research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheffield</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hallam University</ENAMEX>, looks at these issues in relation to conventional
models of text in which a piece of written material
is treated as if it existed in its own right with little
reference to factors or constraints outside it--the socioeconomic
factors of gender and race, for example.  She then
develops a feminist model which extends the parameters
of a text into its surrounding context.  This model, she
asserts, makes space for the possibility, and in fact the
necessity, of integrating notions of gender, race and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>,
and also sociohistorical and economic factors, into the
analysis, and indeed into the definition of the text itself.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second half</TIMEX> of the book, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mills</ENAMEX> employs the
strategies of feminist stylistics to expose the workings of
gender at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> levels of language--the word, the phrase
or sentence, and larger-scale discourse.  Her examples
throughout are taken from widely diverse written materials,
both canonical and nonliterary, including novels,
newspaper articles, advertisements, and popular songs.

            Although the book is described lightly as a tool-kit--
and indeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Summary</ENAMEX> lists questions through which
a text can be analyzed for its representations of gender--
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feminist Stylistics</ENAMEX> is a complex, many-layered approach
to reading that enables a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> to look beneath overt content
in order to see hidden messages which, while often
unrecognized by both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>, nevertheless reinforce
and help to legitimatize stereotypical notions about
gender differences embedded in our culture.

            Examining ready-made phrases referring to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
or in some cases <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX> cites, for example, some
familiar proverbs.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s work is never done seems
to describe a natural state of affairs.  The message is hard
to counter because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> using it does not
take responsibility for inventing it but merely calls on preexisting
commonsense knowledge.  Thus, if a specific
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> complains of having too much work to do, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mills</ENAMEX>
writes, this phrase can be used to suggest that the...
difficulty of the conditions of her [specific] working life
is not as important as the general fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> always
have too much work to do.  It might further suggest that
someone who has, at any given time, completed all the
tasks before her is not, by definition, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.

            Also examined are effects of the grammatical convention
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> that the masculine is the standard or
unmarked form, the feminine being deviant from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">norm</ENAMEX>.  One result is the use of generic words to refer to
males only, of which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX> gives ludicrous examples like
the headline on a news story about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> prevention among
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">TOP PEOPLE TOLD: TAKE A MISTRESS</ENAMEX>.

            For all its lively examples and provocative insights,
this is not a smooth text; it tends toward the prolix, partly
because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s determination to cover all bases.
By the same token it succeeds in floodlighting the protean
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> gender is characterized in texts.  In giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>
the means to recognize--and, if they choose, to
resist--such characterizations, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feminist Stylistics</ENAMEX> is an
important, ground-breaking book.

is Genuine , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hornbeam Press</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapman</ENAMEX>, convinced by nautical and navigational
evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mapstone</ENAMEX> was genuine, felt that the
other runestones of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> must be authentic too.  He
managed to make an appointment with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haugen</ENAMEX>,
who had called them modern.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Haugen</ENAMEX> invited
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapman</ENAMEX> to visit him at his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, and in a lengthy meeting
they discussed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapman</ENAMEX>'s findings.  They agreed on
most matters regarding the runic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> and on many
features of language.  But if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapman</ENAMEX> had hoped to convert
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einar Haugen</ENAMEX> to his own views of the authenticity of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX>, he did not succeed, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> never
deviated from his conviction that they were modern.  He
agreed, however, to keep in touch with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapman</ENAMEX> and to
answer whatever questions he had.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapman</ENAMEX> states (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. ii</ENAMEX>)
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haugen</ENAMEX> had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX>'s open mind (a characteristic
not ordinarily perceived by him in most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>), and he
seemed grateful for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haugen</ENAMEX>'s comments.  This lasted for a
number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> (until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haugen</ENAMEX>'s death, in fact).  The professor
had not been willing to provide a complete translation, for
his time and energy were both consumed in a number of projects
and obligations.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Chapman</ENAMEX> apparently had his own
views of how long it took to provide answers to runic questions
and seems to have, in some cases, expected replies by
return mail.

            He compared the text of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memorial Stone</ENAMEX> with the
contents of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sagas (sometimes called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vinland Sagas</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James E. Knirk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runic Archive of the University</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oslo</ENAMEX>, who read an early draft of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapman</ENAMEX>'s articles
(pp. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31-32</NUMEX>), questioned the validity of using the evidence
of the sagas, which contain so much fictional and fantastic
material.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapman</ENAMEX>'s defense of his procedure is that the two
sagas on which he based his conclusions were mostly factual
and dealt to a great extent with navigation, an area in which
he claims competence and practical experience.

            He seems not too much at home in matters of language.
His subtitle, A Study in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Linguistics</ENAMEX> , bears this out.  He seems
relieved to be able to report that linguists had spent considerable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> in studying the runestones without significant
results or that they were quick to call something
fraudulent.

            The book is, despite these strictures, worth reading,
and judicious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> will probably separate the genuine
from the dubious.  The illustrations are pleasing and informative
and the runes are neatly transcribed.  The author
makes an interesting attempt to account for several features
of the runestones: the reason for their being left in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>,
the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> and other words in the inscriptions,
the implications of runic inscriptions in which oghams occur
together with runes, etc.  One wonders whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spirit Pond</ENAMEX>
has spectral or religious connotation.

            Making the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Alphabet Dance</ENAMEX>
            In <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Language</ENAMEX> on vacation (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dmitri Borgmann</ENAMEX>
redefined the obsolete term logology to mean `wordplay,'
and he also redefined the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> itself.  Now another author
takes a revolutionary approach to wordplay in a handsomely
produced, brilliantly written book.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross Eckler</ENAMEX>'s
Making the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Alphabet Dance</ENAMEX> delves into the fertile substrata
of logology that he calls letterplay, which considers
words as collections of letters to be manipulated.  His
book shows the abundant possibilities in the field.

            Having edited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Word Ways</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of Recreational</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linguistics</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eckler</ENAMEX> knows letterplay better
than anyone else.  He has witnessed it evolve through
the work of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, he has written many articles about
it himself, and now he has traced its development with
the precise logic of a chessmaster of language.  Although
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">letterplay</ENAMEX> can be confusing, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eckler</ENAMEX> deconfuses the forms
and demonstrates the relationships between them.  The
text flows easily from one topic to another, peppered with
examples both serious and humorous.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forbidden Letters</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Obligatory Letters</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, presents several
take-offs on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mary Had a Little Lamb</ENAMEX>, including this sless
version:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> had a little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lamb</ENAMEX> with fleece a pale white hue,

And everywhere that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> went the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lamb</ENAMEX> kept her in
view.

To academe he went with her (illegal and quite rare);

It made the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> laugh and play to view a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lamb</ENAMEX> in
there.

            

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Letter Patterns and Distributions</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eckler</ENAMEX> notes that written wordplay may go back as far as
the origins of written language.  He discusses palindromes
and pangrams and many lesser-known forms based on
patterns.  For instance, word graphs represent words as
letters connected by lines.  This word graph links the letters
in the word before :


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> - R
|   |
F _ E _ B

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Word Fragments</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> that follows, presents similar
ideas, but it involves parts of a word instead of the
whole.

            Central to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eckler</ENAMEX>'s word view is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapter Four</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Transforming One Word</ENAMEX> into Another.  As he sees it, all
of letterplay revolves around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> simple operations by
which one word can be transformed into another--insertion,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deletion</ENAMEX>, and rearrangement of letters.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> type of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transformation</ENAMEX>, the word network, grew out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Carroll</ENAMEX>'s
word ladders (originally called doublets).  In a word
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ladder</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words are connected by changing one letter
at a time:


LESS
LOSS
LOSE
LOVE
MOVE
MORE

            

            In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type of word network, all words of the same length
would be connected at all possible places.

            The next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, Alphabetical Order and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scoring</ENAMEX>,
begins with a discussion of the last word in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and
examines forms that rely on positions of the letters in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alphabet</ENAMEX>.  This paragraph by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allan Simmons</ENAMEX> is an alphabetic
pun:


Eh! Be seedy, ye effigy, at shy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jake</ENAMEX>.

A lemon, opaque.  You are a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stew</ENAMEX>--

Feed a bull, you ex!  Why said?

            

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Word Groups</ENAMEX>, the letterplay shifts to words that
look ordinary alone but become unusual in combination.
The chapter opens with word squares and variations, like
the compound word square invented by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hairy Partridge</ENAMEX>:


      toe   own   bib
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATE</ENAMEX>   At    To    bE
SET   So    wE    iT
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MAY</TIMEX>   Me    An    bY

            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> on Number Words explores the fascinating
things that happen when words and numbers
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collide</ENAMEX>.  Many of the resulting forms are ideal for
computer letter-crunching.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Sallows</ENAMEX> had to build
a special-purpose computer to write this self-enumerating
sentence:


This sentence contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> a<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">'s</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> c's, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">d's</ENAMEX>,

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two l</TIMEX>'s, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sixteen n's</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">o's</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">r's</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">s</ENAMEX>'s,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty-two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t's</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u's</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> v's, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w's</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> x's,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y's</ENAMEX>, and only one z.

            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Afterword</ENAMEX> concludes with a look at words as
single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>.  It is divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sections--geometric
views of words and a discussion of long words.

            
               Making the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Alphabet Dance</ENAMEX> is the manifesto of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> whose love for words goes far beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> letters.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most important wordplay books of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th century</TIMEX>, it gives a name to letterplay and traces its
evolution.  Although the field is complex, both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novice</ENAMEX> can make new discoveries.  And that, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eckler</ENAMEX> would
be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to say, is exciting:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the great joys of recreational <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">linguistics</ENAMEX> is the
chance to do original work, to discover new
techniques or better examples illustrating old ones.
Such contributions can even be made by the diligent
newcomer to the field; it is not always necessary to
serve a long apprenticeship mastering past results.

            The Words We Use
            
               The Words We Use is a very readable book about
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words, though, from the notes at the ends of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chapters</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> infers that it was intended as an informal
text.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> gets the impression, though the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>,
educated at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>, was Professor
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Linguistics</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Hong</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kong</ENAMEX>, that the book is either for beginning linguists or
for interested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> from other disciplines.  It suffers
from one severe, reprehensible shortcoming: it lacks an
index, something no book should be without.

            The book is short and simple, but not simplistic (a
word used by some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> to avoid over-simplified );
it is divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> brief chapters, the titles of
which will give a good indication of what they are about
(for a change).  Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> concludes with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Notes</ENAMEX> and
Suggested Further Reading, and from the fairly sophisticated
materials listed, one is not deluded into thinking
that this is a lightweight work.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> are headed:


What is a word?
The trouble with dictionaries
The use of words: what happens when we talk
How did words originate?
How do words change their meaning?
Word borrowing
How are new words created?
Words as structures
How do we learn to use words?
Choosing between words--words in context
On the tip of one's tongue
The written word
Words and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>
Sticks and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX>: words as reality

            

            There is an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Afterword</ENAMEX> that is even friendlier than
the text.  Space does not permit a more thorough investigation
of the content, save to offer the advice that time
spent with this book will prove informative and rewarding.
