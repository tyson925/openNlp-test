            At the very end of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last century</TIMEX>, there was a
crisis at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bailey Circus</ENAMEX>.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who was shot out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cannon</ENAMEX> during each show
was asked by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> to quit his high-risk job, much to
the distress of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.T</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnum</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnum</ENAMEX>, whose
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wit</ENAMEX> was equal to his showmanship, summoned the fellow
to him and said, ‚ÄúI beg you to reconsider.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> of
your caliber are hard to find.‚Äù

            Without fully realizing it, all of us speak the language
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> and cannons in our everyday conversation,
and many words and phrases we spark forth date
back to the era of black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">powder</ENAMEX> and muzzleloading.
Take the words shot, shoot , and shooting .  Sure as
shooting, some hotshot big shot is bound to shoot the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">breeze</ENAMEX> and shoot this big mouth off about taking a
cheap shot potshot at some troubleshooting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX>.
Then he shoots his bolt and wad by taking a long
shot at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some</NUMEX> one-shot deal that will win him the whole
shooting match.  It is not always easy to ascertain
whether the underlying metaphor in such expressions
is the bow and arrow or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cannon</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peter</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Douglas</ENAMEX>'s ‚ÄúThe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bows' Stratagem,‚Äù VERBATIM VI</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX>),
but we can be fairly certain that the wad in shooting
one's wad refers to the wad that held the powder and
shot in position to be fired from early <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> and that
the pot in potshot signifies the dinner pot to be filled
with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> that was shot close up without any
regard for rules.

            Or take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the most popular verbs we use to
describe somebody who has been dismissed from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">job‚Äî</ENAMEX> fired and discharged .  Both are metaphors that
compare the unfortunate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> to a projectile shot out
of a gun or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cannon</ENAMEX>.  Hand <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> of the fourteenth century
were equipped with touchholes; in order to discharge
such a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> it was necessary to touch it with
a torch.

            I am feeling quick on the trigger, quick on the
draw, hot as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pistol</ENAMEX>, and loaded for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX>, so I am
going to get the drop on you and let you have it with
both barrels.  Here is a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arsenal</ENAMEX> of words and
expressions that turn out to be figurative spark-offs
from the language of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> and cannons.

            
               bite the bullet If you visit a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revolutionary</ENAMEX>
War battle site, like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Ticonderoga</ENAMEX>, you may see
some gruesome artifacts in its museum‚Äîbullets with
teeth marks in them.  Having no real anesthesia to ease
the agony of amputation or surgery, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries ago</TIMEX> offered wounded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> the only pain
reducer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">available‚Äîa bullet</ENAMEX> to bite on.  The whole idea
of such a procedure is enough to make one sweat bullets.
After anesthesia was introduced in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1844</TIMEX>, the phrase came flguratively to mean to `deal
with a bad situation resolutely,' as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rudyard Kipling</ENAMEX>'s
lines ‚ÄúBite the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bullet</ENAMEX>, old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>,/ And don't let them
think you're afraid.‚Äù

            
               flash in the pan This phrase sounds as if it
derives from the way that prospectors pan rivers for
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>.  In truth, though, flash in the pan refers to the
occasional misfiring of the old flintlock muskets when
the flash of the primer in the pan of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifle</ENAMEX> failed to
ignite the explosion of the charge.  The estimates of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">misfirings</ENAMEX> like this run <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as high as fifteen percent</NUMEX> by
those who fire flintlocks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>, when the expression
signifies an intense but short-lived success or a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who fails to live up to his or her early promise.

            
               go off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> cocked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muzzleloaders</ENAMEX>, then as
now, had a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> cock, or safety position, for a gun's
hammer that partially back-locked the trigger mechanism
so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> could not be fired.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half</NUMEX> cock
does not give enough power to generate sparks and fire
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pistol</ENAMEX>, so it is a futile gesture.  Thus, in modern
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parlance</ENAMEX>, when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> goes off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> cocked (or at
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> cock ), he or she is not in control of the situation.

            
               skinflint In many parts of early <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, necessities
such as flint were scarce.  When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flint</ENAMEX> used in a flintlock <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> had worn away, it lost
proper contact with the frizzen and caused inadequate
sparking to set off the powder charge.  Faced with this
problem, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun toters</ENAMEX> would skin, or sharpen the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">flint</ENAMEX> with a knife, creating a bevel in the flint, which
could then make full contact and generate an adequate
shower of sparks.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> who ‚Äúskinned his flint‚Äù was
looked upon as being a parsimonious, penny-pinching,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stingy cheapskate‚Äîa veritable skinflint</ENAMEX>.

            
               ramrod A ramrod is a rod of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> or metal
for ramming the ball and patch down the barrel of a
muzzleloading firearm and setting them against the
main powder charge.  Eventually <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ramrod</ENAMEX> became personified,
taking on the added meaning of `one marked
by rigidity, stiffness, and severity,' even though the
original ramrods, which were straight, were rather
flexible.

            
               point-blank In ballistics, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> fired
point-blank is one whose sights are aimed directly at a
target so that the projectile speeds to its destination in
a flat trajectory.  By extension, a point-blank question
or accusation is one that is direct and straightforward
‚Äîright to the mark.  The opposite of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">point</NUMEX>-blank is
hanging fire , `undecided, up in the air.'  In munitions,
hanging fire describes the delay in the explosion or
charge in a firearm.

            
               heavens to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy</ENAMEX>!  Digging up the roots of this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exclamation</ENAMEX> has given many a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> calluses and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bent</ENAMEX> back.  In his introduction to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heavens to Betsy</ENAMEX> and
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curious Sayings</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harper</ENAMEX> & Row, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Earle Funk</ENAMEX> said that the very title of his book ‚Äúturned
out eventually to be completely unsolvable.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Funk</ENAMEX> dismisses
Queen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth</ENAMEX> I and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy Ross</ENAMEX> as possible
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eponymous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and concludes, ‚ÄúIt is much more
likely to have been derived in some way from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">frontiersman</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rifle</ENAMEX> or gun which, for some unknown reason,
he always fondly called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy</ENAMEX>.  However, despite
exhaustive research, I am reluctantly forced to resort
to the familiar lexical locution, `Source unknown.' ‚Äù
Discussion with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX>-loving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> supports <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Funk</ENAMEX>'s
penultimate etymology.  The smooth-bore muskets used
during colonial, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionary</ENAMEX>, and frontier <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> were
known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown Besses</ENAMEX>, hence the nickname <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy</ENAMEX> .

            
               cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass
monkey Before you cancel your subscription,
please read on.  In nautical jargon, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> was a
tray-like metal casting with round indentations arranged
in a square pattern.  These ‚Äúmonkeys‚Äù held
pyramids of cannonballs for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> in a muzzleloading
battery on a battleship.  Soon iron monkeys gave
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to more expensive but corrosion-resistant brass
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>.  But because the iron balls and the brass
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> had markedly different coefficients of expansion,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> of cannonballs had a tendency to
collapse during cold snaps‚Äîweather that was cold
enough to freeze the balls off a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">brass monkey</ENAMEX>.

            As further ammunition to support my bulletproof
contention that our language is loaded with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>
and cannons, I'll conclude by gunning for items that
have the word gun in them.

            
               go great <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> The word great used to mean
`big,' and great <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> referred to cannons and other
large firearms, as opposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúsmall guns‚Äù</ENAMEX> or musket
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rifles</ENAMEX>.  By the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteenth century</TIMEX>, these uses of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX> and small became obsolete, but to go great guns
continued to allude to the loudness, forcefulness, and
large size of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">long-ago</TIMEX> cannons and still means to `proceed
with considerable momentum, to go full steam
ahead, at full bore.'

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of a gun This expression is frequently employed
as a euphemism for another phrase that begins
with the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> words, but the question remains
why gun has been elected as the surrogate word.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sailor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wordbook</ENAMEX> , published <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a hundred</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, offers this explanation: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äú `Son</ENAMEX> of a gun' is an
epithet conveying contempt in a slight degree and was
originally applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> born afloat.  One admiral
declares that he was literally thus cradled, under the
breast of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun-carriage</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  Taking this clue, word detectives
suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of a gun originated during the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteenth century</TIMEX>, when nonmilitary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were
permitted to live aboard naval <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>.  When one of
these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> gave birth to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> without knowing
which sailor had fathered it, the paternity was logged
as ‚Äúgun,‚Äù perhaps alluding to the midship <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX>, which
was often located near the makeshift maternity <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>.

            
               stick to one's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> When we stick to our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>,
we hold adamantly to our position.  To stand and continue
firing when under heavy attack on the battlefield
took courage because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artillerymen</ENAMEX> usually lacked infantry
weapons.  When an artilleryman broke and ran,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> could turn the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> to their own use.  Thus,
many a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX> was actually chained to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> to ensure
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bravery</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spike</ENAMEX> one's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> If an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> had to fall back
and abandon its field <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">artillery</ENAMEX>, the simplest way to
render its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> useless was to jam a spike into the fuse
hole.  Gradually, spike one's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> came to mean `frustrate
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> by blocking his intended plan of
action.'

            
               give it the gun While giving their airplane engines
all the gas they could handle, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX> combat
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> would open fire on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> with their
machine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>.  This led to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of rapid
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">acceleration with ‚Äúgunning</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and to give it the gun
was soon extended to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobiles</ENAMEX>, speedboats, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">objects</ENAMEX> and matters nonmechanical.

            Sure as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shootin</ENAMEX>', I've just shot my wad‚Äîlock,
stock, and barrel‚Äîdemonstrating how <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> and cannons
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">echo</ENAMEX> through our language.  Please don't think me
a trigger-happy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of a gun if I shoot the breeze with
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> last pistol-packing explanation.  The lock, stock,
and barrel are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main components of a gun
that together compose essentially the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX>.
Thus, lock, stock, and barrel has come to mean the
entirety of something‚Äîthe whole shooting match.
         
         
            Duende: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gypsy Soul and Something More</ENAMEX>



            Besides going to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencia</ENAMEX> for paella, the compleat
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">traveler</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> should experience duende .  This
is not easy to arrange, however, for duende , unlike
paella, cannot be made to order.  All the ingredients
may be present‚Äîthe music, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singers</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX>,
the setting, and costumes‚Äîbut, alas, duende itself
fails to show up and the production fizzles.

            As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cognoscenti</ENAMEX> define it, duende (pronounced
DWEHN-deh) is a `magical quality, of a peculiarly <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nature</ENAMEX>, that raises a performance to peaks of enthrallment.'
The occasions when duende grips a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX> or torero are punctuated with cries of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúOl√©!‚Äù</ENAMEX>
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>.  When a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performer</ENAMEX> is inspired, it is
said that he, or she, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äútiene duende‚Äù</ENAMEX> (`has it').

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spanishness</ENAMEX> of duende is underlined by the
absence of a look-alike word in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romance</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">languages</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.  Like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>
has estro , from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> oestrus `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gadfly</ENAMEX>' (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">estrus</ENAMEX> )
to denote artistic inspiration (and female sexual
heat), but duende goes further.  It is something like the
zone of current sports lingo in which a <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX>,
say, enters a trance-like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, putting him on a roll
where he can't miss a shot.  But duende has deeper
vibrations, evoking for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disciples</ENAMEX> the very ethos of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soul</ENAMEX> , from the black culture, is perhaps closest
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.

            
               Duende meant `hobgoblin,' `sprite,' or `ghost' in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX>, but it is not known when it
acquired its artistic coloration.  It did not become a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">buzzword</ENAMEX>, at any rate, until fairly recently.  In his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberia</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James A. Michener</ENAMEX> said
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duende ‚Äúnow</ENAMEX> dominates <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> conversation‚Äù and
‚Äúseems to have become the sine qua non of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>
existence,‚Äù whereas in previous visits to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> he had
not heard it at all.  At the time he was writing, Michener
noted that dictionaries had not caught up with the
current meaning.  It does appear now, however, in dictionaries
and the English-language <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
Times story by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubert Saal</ENAMEX> on flamenco (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 22</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>) speaks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúmysterious duende ‚Äù</ENAMEX> as ‚Äúa kind of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gypsy soul</ENAMEX>, which flies only on the wings of spontaneity
and improvisation.‚Äù  I have seen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a calendar</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Workman</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Publishing Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>) which defined it as
‚Äúpersonal magnetism and charm,‚Äù and said, ‚ÄúGiven
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s extensive TV coverage, political candidates
need duende if they hope to be accepted by the
public.‚Äù

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Etymologists</ENAMEX> say it originally meant due√±o de una
casa `lord, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX>, of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX>' and is a contraction of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duen de casa</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duen</ENAMEX> is the apocopated (cut-off) form of
due√±o , which stems from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin dominus</ENAMEX> .  As the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> word evolved, the de was suffixed to the duen ,
the casa was omitted altogether, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el</ENAMEX> duende thus
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">became ‚Äúthe lord</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  But its plural form
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duendes</ENAMEX> also signified `household gods,' like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lares</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penates</ENAMEX>, and took on even broader, pantheistic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overtones</ENAMEX> in duendes <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">de las monta√±as y de las</ENAMEX>
cuevas `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spirits</ENAMEX> of the mountains and caves.'

            The connotation of gifted artistic performance,
however, might stem from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gypsy</ENAMEX> culture in Andalusia
whose dialect, cal√≥ , has words like duquende
(possibly from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dook</ENAMEX> ) meaning `spirit or
ghost,' and duquendio , meaning `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maestro</ENAMEX>.'  One
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scholar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen Josephs</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of West Florida</ENAMEX>,
surmised that ‚Äúfrom duquendio or duquende to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duende</ENAMEX> is a short step, especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Andalusia</ENAMEX>, where
gypsy mastery would be precisely flamenco mastery.‚Äù

            Whatever its derivation, duende as artistic inspiration
found its apostle and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guru</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Andalusian</ENAMEX>-born
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Federico Garc√≠a Lorca</ENAMEX>, lyric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dramatist</ENAMEX> who
was murdered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 38</TIMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early days</TIMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish Civil War</ENAMEX>.  His empathy with the gypsies of
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> region is reflected in many of his poems.  In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garc√≠a Lorca</ENAMEX> gave a lecture in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buenos Aires</ENAMEX> on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teor√≠a y Juego del Duende</ENAMEX> (`<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Theory and Play of</ENAMEX>

The address (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obras Completas, Aguilar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>,

he describes duende variously as ‚Äúthe spirit of the

a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX> transforming

gem by virtue of her ‚Äúrhythms, silences and
intention.‚Äù

            But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garc√≠a Lorca</ENAMEX> also finds duende to be intimately
linked with death and hence achieving its most
striking manifestation in the bullfight.  ‚ÄúAt the moment
of the kill,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúthe help of duende is needed to
bring it off with artistic truth.‚Äù

            As the above citations indicate, the distribution of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-letter words is quite broad, extending from The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother Jones</ENAMEX> , from the print world
to cartoon <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and TV land.  Its domain is clearly
more extensive than the range of argot or slang.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noteworthy</ENAMEX>, too, are the strategies that have been
devised to cope with the limits of our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-six</TIMEX> letter
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alphabet</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users</ENAMEX> are apparently willing to risk being
misunderstood by giving new meanings to a single letter,
as the citations show.  How much context can clarify
meaning is difficult to determine, but it may help
to recall that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> letter set has a multitude of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meanings</ENAMEX>.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX> devotes
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty-one</NUMEX> pages to set ).  Another strategy often used
to assure comprehension is to use a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-letter word
and then to follow it with the meaning intended.  Thus
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Lunden</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC-TV</ENAMEX> said to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Crowley</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄúAre
you ready to use the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-word recession ?‚Äù  Many words
like recession could be called semi-taboo words or limited
taboos, for scarcely anyone would be shocked or
offended to encounter them, though some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> avoid
using them.

            Perhaps most promising in expanding the range of
meanings for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-letter words are variant forms.  Thus
we now have the big A as well as the A-word and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>-question as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>-word .  Perhaps we shall see
such forms as the little A , the new A , or the A-option .
If these variants prove productive, the lexicon of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-letter
words could ‚Äúspread like wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>,‚Äù as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldwyn</ENAMEX> once said.  We could then stop asking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-question :
what is the future of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-letter word?

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O ne</ENAMEX> cannot but admire a standard dictionary
that defines middle-aged as ‚Äúbetween youth
and old age, variously reckoned to suit the reckoner‚Äù
and says that the verb perpetrate means ‚Äúto execute
or commit (esp. an offence, a poem, or a pun).‚Äù

            These definitions are given in the most recent
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>) edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers 20th Century Dictionary</ENAMEX> ,
which was edited and published in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edinburgh</ENAMEX>.  For a
desk dictionary (or college <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">dictionary</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
like to call them) it is rather pricey at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$36.95</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äîbut
I do not think that the ghost of my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father glowered</ENAMEX> (good <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Scots</ENAMEX> word, that) at me when I
bought my copy of it.  Incidentally, it is now the reference
dictionary for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">National Scrabble Championship</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>.

            This edition when published was said to give more
word definitions than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">desk dictionary</ENAMEX>;
including its main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Concise Oxford</ENAMEX> .
But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> it was moved into <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> place by the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Collins Dictionary of the English</ENAMEX>
Language .  ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Webster's New World Dictionary of the</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Language</ENAMEX> seems about the same size as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gage Canadian Dictionary</ENAMEX> is slightly
smaller.)  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers</ENAMEX> was issued in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1898</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Shaw</ENAMEX> said of it, ‚Äúmy favorite of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dozen</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scots</ENAMEX> who edit and publish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers</ENAMEX> do not
accept what most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX>
do when they say some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> words that have
become standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> on both sides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>.
For instance it gives ‚Äúplayed‚Äù as the proper pronunciation
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">plaid ‚Äîalthough</ENAMEX>, with delicate condescension,
it parenthetically notes, ‚Äúby the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> also `plad.' ‚Äù
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concise Oxford</ENAMEX> allows both pronunciations.  It is
shameful that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gage Canadian</ENAMEX> allows <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only ‚Äúplad</NUMEX>.‚Äù
as does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s New World .  According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers</ENAMEX> ,
a plaid is ‚Äúa long piece of woollen cloth, worn over the
shoulder‚Äù‚Äîand it need not be of checked material,
which is ‚Äúplad,‚Äù as we generally think of it.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>
the checked material, of course, is tartan .

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1984</TIMEX> I moved from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX>, on
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver Island</ENAMEX>, where I now enjoy genteel retirement.
Not long after settling here I asked for a raisin
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scone</ENAMEX> in one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s tonier <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>.  I pronounced
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scone</ENAMEX> to rhyme with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> , and I was upset a little when
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waitress</ENAMEX> brought it to me and said, in a pleasant
English accent, ‚ÄúYour scone sir,‚Äù rhyming it with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan</ENAMEX> .  I
wondered if I should switch to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan</ENAMEX>-pronunciation
now that I am living in veddy English <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX>.  But
then, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scots</ENAMEX> played the dominant role in early <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX>,
and there are many oatmeal accents to be heard
here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX> allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scots</ENAMEX> pronunciation,
but, I am sorry to report, favors the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers</ENAMEX>
gave me warm feelings of assurance when I consulted it
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later that day</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúSkohn</ENAMEX>,‚Äù as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> , is given as the proper
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pronunciation</ENAMEX>, but it reports that ‚Äúin the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>
often (it is) pronounced `skoan.' ‚Äù  The definition
given has nice rhetorical balance, almost <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnsonian</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúa</ENAMEX>
flattish, usually round or quadrant-shaped plain cake of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dough</ENAMEX> without much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX>, with or without currants,
baked on a griddle or in an oven.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Wisdom</ENAMEX> on the scone -pronunciation
issue was shown by Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Gowers</ENAMEX> in
his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX> revision of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.W. Fowler</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Dictionary of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Modern English Usage</ENAMEX> .  He moved on from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fowler</ENAMEX>'s following
of the big <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX> in allowing
both pronunciations but with preference for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúskoan</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
Gowers, himself an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Englishman</ENAMEX>, said that ‚Äúin <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>,
its land of origin, the pronunciation is skawn , and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who know this so pronounce it.‚Äù

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dictionary buffs</ENAMEX> have long been attracted to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers</ENAMEX> because its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> have not scrupled against
a little editorializing in some of the definitions they
offer, such as those already mentioned.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> is
offered a choice with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>-eater: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúa cannibal</ENAMEX>: a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger</ENAMEX>
or other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> that has acquired the habit of eating
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>: a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> given to chasing, catching and devouring
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  An eclair is ‚Äúa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX>, long in shape but short
in duration, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX> filling and chocolate or other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">icing</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  A picture-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">restorer</ENAMEX> is ‚Äúone who cleans and restores
and sometimes ruins old pictures.‚Äù  That kind of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pawkiness</ENAMEX> is fitting in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dictionary edited</ENAMEX> and published
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edinburgh</ENAMEX> and which defines pawky as a
Scots word meaning ‚Äúdrily or slyly humorous.‚Äù

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feckless ‚Äî‚Äúspiritless</ENAMEX>, helpless, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">futile‚Äù‚Äîis</ENAMEX> given in
all my desk dictionaries, but only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers</ENAMEX> has feck
(nice to see a lost positive found), which comes from
effect through vowel-loss and is defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúefficacy‚Äù</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äúquality.</ENAMEX>‚Äù

            The pronunciations given in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers</ENAMEX> are not
those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Received Pronunciation‚Äîthe BBC</ENAMEX> or Oxonian
accent‚Äîas they are in all the other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>
dictionaries I have consulted.  It is quite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> about the
r -sound when it follows a vowel-sound or is at the ends
of words, not dropping it as is usual with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> but
insisting that it be given full value, in various ways, as
it is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scots</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> and, generally but not always, in
the speech of most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> except for those in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>.  (And of us <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> too,
except for a few who like to toff-up their speech just
ever so.)

            An <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> on dictionaries, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Root</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hulbert</ENAMEX>, says that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Concise Oxford</ENAMEX> is the best for
literary use in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers</ENAMEX> the best ‚Äúfor general
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> use.‚Äù  I must assume that he did not take
into account <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers</ENAMEX>'s pronunciation principles.
That assessment was made before the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX> a
peared on the dictionary scene.  I do not know how he
would rate it, but I must confess that for general use I
am inclined to put it just a little ahead of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers</ENAMEX> .
But I haven't found it quite as much fun to browse in.

            Recently in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers</ENAMEX> I came across the adjective
perjink , a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Scots</ENAMEX> word given also in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX> , but not in
any of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">desk dictionaries</ENAMEX> I use: it means
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äúprim</ENAMEX>: finical.‚Äù  A more emphatic adjective is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perjinkety</ENAMEX> ; and it has the noun perjinkity , defined as
‚Äúa nicety.‚Äù  It also gives pernickety as another Scots
word with a similar meaning: this is found in the other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionaries</ENAMEX>.  I am inclined to prefer perjink and its
derivatives.

            Word-fanciers, and not only those with some sort
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> bias, might enjoy dipping into another
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers dictionary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chambers Scots Dictionary</ENAMEX> ,
which was <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> issued in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1911</TIMEX> and most recently reprinted
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>.  It is specifically a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary of Scots</ENAMEX>,
or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lallans</ENAMEX>, which some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> consider merely a dialect
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and others a distinct language rooted in
Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  A good book for browsing in, giving
many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scots</ENAMEX> words which have come into use in other
parts of the English-speaking world and others which
could perhaps add a little color (or colour) to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vocabulary</ENAMEX> here and there.
         
         

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Re Sam Hinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Meaning of Scientific Names</ENAMEX>
[XI<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX>], I have had an experience which, in true biological
tradition, will probably make me mildly notorious
in perpetuity.  I collected, in northeastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>, a
very large (ca. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 inch</NUMEX>) species of robber fly (family
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asilidae</ENAMEX> ).  This I turned over to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who was an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> in that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diptera</ENAMEX> , for study, identification,
and naming.  He found the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> to be unnamed,
and did me the real honor of naming it
rodecki , meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúof Rodeck</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  The result of his well-meant
and highly-appreciated gesture is that there is
now in the deathless literature of entomology a robber
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fly species</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proctacanthus</ENAMEX> rodecki <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>, which
is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">roughly translated ‚</NUMEX>ÄúRodeck's thorny anus.‚Äù





         
         

            Thank you ever so much for having communicated
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>'s objection to my transliteration of
tadachi with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> is .  It was indeed a mistake.  I might
have been influenced by the preceding double is in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tadashii</ENAMEX> .  But I find that tadachi ni is frequently written
and printed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words, ni meaning `in,' so that
tadachi ni just might be equivalent to something like
`in the immediate.'  The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Kenkyusha dictionary</ENAMEX> has even
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> signs for it, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-chi and -ni</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiragana</ENAMEX>, following
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> character which in my naive innocence I
would pronounce tadachi by itself.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> do
pronounce it chih , meaning `directly, at once.'

            I cannot however be compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolboys</ENAMEX>:
I have never been to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, and I am self-taught;
I can read and write <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> (slowly) for I did learn
both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Katakana</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hiragana</ENAMEX> syllabaries (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> signs
each) as well as a few <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>.
My speech, of course, is very hesitant and often discouraging.
There is nobody around I could practise
with.




         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Maledicta 9,</ENAMEX>

            Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reinhold Aman</ENAMEX> has been publishing
Maledicta , subtitled The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Journal of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verbal Aggression</ENAMEX> , from his bivouac in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waukesha</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maledicta</ENAMEX> is not for everyone's taste, and some
may even go so far as to maintain that the subject of its
attention is not a valid one for investigation.  There is
no arguing with taste, but even those who support the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> tenet must admit that if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> felt that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, syphilis, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, there would not
be much point to research at all.  It is unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aman</ENAMEX>
to cloak his subject‚Äîdirty language‚Äîunder the euphemism
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúverbal aggression‚Äù</ENAMEX>: he and most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
of the articles appearing in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maledicta</ENAMEX> let it all
hang out; some, however, tuck it away neatly and
write under a pseudonym.  (And everyone should now
take <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> to ponder the meaning of it in the
preceding sentence.)

            Not all of verbal aggression is concerned with
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-letter words; much of it (and many of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-letter
words) involves insults, racist and other prejudicial
language, and other parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nether</ENAMEX> reaches of
language formerly represented largely by asterisks.  (I
have often wondered why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> did not have
the nerve to call themselves ‚ÄúF**k and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wagnalls</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>)  To
ignore it is plainly wrong; all the reasons that can be
adduced for ignoring it are compelling testimony to its
impact, and anything with such impact cannot‚Äîmust
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">not‚Äîbe</ENAMEX> dismissed as unimportant.  Contrary to popular
belief, the point of studying verbal aggression is not
to modify or ameliorate or eliminate it‚Äîserious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>
consider it bad form to tamper with the evidence‚Äîbut
to describe and codify it, much as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
have tried to do with all other available
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phenomena</ENAMEX>, whether natural or artificial, whether in
pure or physical or social science.  To quote in part
from what may be termed its ‚Äústatement of purpose,‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äú Maledicta</ENAMEX> specializes in uncensored studies and glossaries
of offensive and negatively valued words and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expressions</ENAMEX>, from all languages and cultures, past and
present.‚Äù

            The present volume, only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> in arrears,
includes an interview by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aman</ENAMEX> with Lillian Mermin
Feinsilver, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of The
Taste of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> .  At the end of the interview is a good
bibliography of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feinsilver</ENAMEX>'s work.  It should be noted
that interviews are quite rare in such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>, and it is
certainly unusual to find a linguist humanized by such
a device.  Although the interview suffers from a number
of faults‚Äîfor instance, it is not penetrating or
thorough enough, probably because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aman</ENAMEX> is a better
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scholar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interviewer</ENAMEX>, and it
contains gratuitous information about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interviewer</ENAMEX>
who cannot resist blowing his own horn‚Äîit is at least
an attempt at documenting that has not, to my knowledge,
been done before in the field of linguistics.  Perhaps
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aman</ENAMEX> will sharpen his perspective and techniques
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institute</ENAMEX> such interviews as a regular
feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maledicta</ENAMEX> .

            Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feinsilver</ENAMEX> has an interesting article in this
volume, too, ‚ÄúComment on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aman</ENAMEX>'s `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Yiddish Minnie-Legend</ENAMEX>'
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romanization</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  Other articles
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">include ‚ÄúIs George Bush</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wimp ?,‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe Moving</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spray Can‚Äù</ENAMEX> (on graffiti in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>), ‚ÄúOn the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pronunciation</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cunnilingus</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dictionaries</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and numerous
others on a wide variety of subjects; these are interspersed
with short bits and pieces, cartoons, and asides
generally attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúFolklore‚Äù</ENAMEX> and, presumably,
gathered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>.  Although the subject matter
might be viewed as an area of legitimate investigation,
I am not sure I see the point in employing the subject
style of language in the descriptive text, which would
be far more telling were it restricted to the language of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">linguistic clinician</ENAMEX>.  Aman evidently disagrees, for
his writing is peppered (salted?) with references like
‚Äúevery asshole with access to a typewriter.‚Äù  It is many
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> since my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contemporaries</ENAMEX> and I got a kick out of
seeing even the bowdlerized f**k in print (in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Partridge</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English</ENAMEX> ,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1935</TIMEX>), and fug in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mailer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Naked and the</ENAMEX>
Dead allowed prudery to mock itself.  But the power of
words is such that I contend their impact is totally lost
if not treated clinically: somehow, there is a difference
between ‚ÄúSomeone had written shit on the wall‚Äù and
‚ÄúSome asshole had written shit on the wall‚Äù: the writer
of the former has more credibility; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> of the
latter was, very likely, the very asshole who had written
shit on the wall.

            These are minor quibbles.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maledicta</ENAMEX> is instructive,
funny, gross, informative, vulgar, impolite, and
sometimes well written.  I am afraid that an adjective
like penetrating is not only a bit strong but would be
likely to be adopted as a slogan by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>.  I do
think that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aman</ENAMEX> contributes something important to
the linguistic literature, and I think he ought to view a
bit more seriously (and less rancorously) the opportunities
accorded him by his experience with these powerful,
private parts of the language to pursue a theme
of analysis of its impact and why and how it carries so
much weight, both denotatively and connotatively.

29th, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC Radio Scotland</ENAMEX> program was running a

            To a Western ear, the most predictable of language
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">traits</ENAMEX>, perhaps, is the well-advertised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
use of r for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">our l</TIMEX> .  Indeed, in my travels about
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honshu</ENAMEX> during a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-month</TIMEX> visit, I did hear ‚Äúcoinrocker,‚Äù
‚Äúsee you rater,<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äù ‚ÄúAdurt Graphics‚Äù</ENAMEX> (dirty books),
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúblackwrrants‚Äù</ENAMEX> (hit-and-miss rendering of black walnuts),
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúCoffee Corombia‚Äù</ENAMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of coffee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>), and
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúCoconut Glove</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> spell and pronounce
what they hear and are accustomed to pronounce,
much as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are inclined to say ‚ÄúKindagarden,‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúekscape,‚Äù ‚Äúlawnjeray,‚Äù ‚Äúasterik,‚Äù</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúekcetera</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  Such
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spellings</ENAMEX> and soundings are hardly surprising, however
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">delightful</ENAMEX>.  They may at least begin to suggest the considerable
language barrier between my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> and me.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> may provide a good analogy to what I experienced
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>.  We are not taught to speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> (a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúdead‚Äù language</ENAMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> are not taught to
speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  Thus I met any number of expressions
which I could work out, given their contexts, and
which have in common both a valiant attempt to use
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and an unfamiliarity with idiom.  Among
these are: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúGet Back‚Äù</ENAMEX> (a sign flashed on TV to invite or
command the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX> to return after the commercial,

of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Junior</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äù and ‚ÄúLady's Salad with Whipped Cream</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
For me, all of these expressions convey a plucky willingness
to learn a foreign language and to use it in
everyday situations.  In the words of a newspaper ad
for a language school, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúDo Mistake‚</ENAMEX>ÄîLearn <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            When my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and I approached the heart of
the course‚Äîtalking the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> language‚Äînothing
seemed to work for me until I closed all the books and
compelled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> at a time to put themselves
in commonplace situations in which they had to
speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  Going to the game, shopping, making
plans to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>, giving directions to one another
or to me‚Äîthese little situations created high
drama more often than not, but they also brought
about utterances, sounds on which we could at least
start to work.  Incidentally, I startled them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Borge</ENAMEX>'s punctuation system, which instructed
and delighted them with its differentiated
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">popping</ENAMEX> and spitting.  I think we made modest progress
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX>.

            On the other hand, of course, I had to swallow
my own pedagogy in my trips to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and in my
efforts to buy train tickets to the right places.  Sometimes
I gave up, as when pointing to my temples
(white) brought shampoo rather than the desired
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">bleach</ENAMEX>.  At other times I won because I could eventually
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dig</ENAMEX> out the desired object from the shelf (no help
at the train <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>).  Sometimes I engaged in pantomime
of undoubtedly ludicrous dimensions.  This had
the effect of puzzling some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerks</ENAMEX>, of occasionally leading
to communication (finger-pinching for clothespins
worked, for example), and most often of bringing out
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerks</ENAMEX>' sense of humor, expressed in good-natured if
frustrated laughter.  I found that by pointing to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> in
a refrigerator, pulling up my collar, slapping my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sides</ENAMEX>,
and frowning‚Äîand by then throwing open my coat,
mopping my brow, and smiling‚ÄîI could get the desired
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unchilled</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer (‚Äúhotto beeru‚Äù</ENAMEX>).  It was impossible
not to remain humble in these circumstances.  My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
were waging a linguistic battle, whereas I was
merely doing a bad job of imitating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marcel Marceau</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese English</ENAMEX> is a great joy and a wondrous
thing, as I have indicated.  What a pleasure, for example,
to discover that one who has been tagged out at
home plate is the victim of an ‚Äúout-throw.‚Äù  How reassuring
to be told by one's smiling, hooded, middleaged
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman caddy</ENAMEX> that one's drive is ‚Äúsafe-o‚Äù‚Äîthat is,
not unfindable; or that one's next shot will require a
‚Äúnine-o‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an ‚Äúeight-o‚</NUMEX>Äù or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúwedgie‚Äù</ENAMEX> (if one is in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúsand-o‚Äù</ENAMEX>).  What a surprise to hear, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentator</ENAMEX> on a televised golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tourney</ENAMEX> describe a
reverse-necked putter colloquially, and then to hear
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broadcaster</ENAMEX> translate that description
into a terse sentence or two ending with the expression
‚Äúbassackawad putta.‚Äù  What a curious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sensation</ENAMEX> to have
a cabaret <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> stop her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professional</ENAMEX> smiling and knee-patting,
forget about passing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">scotch</ENAMEX> and veggies while
carrying on in rudimentary <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English (‚</ENAMEX>ÄúWhat is your
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hobby?‚Äù</ENAMEX>), and run into the back room for her textbook
in order to ask how to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pronounce ‚Äúbanal</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            Other experiences are linguistic only in reverse, or
only as one thinks of what the language ought to be.
For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Garner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rockford</ENAMEX> dubbed as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenor</ENAMEX> is a reminder of one's firm awareness of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> tone and timbre.  Better yet, the
dubbed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Reeve</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Margot Kidder, Marlon</ENAMEX>
Brando, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> made me conscious of how I
had originally <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúheard‚Äù Superman I</ENAMEX> , and of how I commonly
ignore what pitch and range (apart from diction
and idiom) contribute to any language.  Best of
all, probably, was the unintentional but unavoidable
hilarity roused by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hattie McDaniels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butterfly McQueen</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vivien Leigh</ENAMEX> as they jabbered and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">squeaked</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashley Wilkes</ENAMEX>, Mista
Rhett, and the fall of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX>.  A perennial language
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">puzzler</ENAMEX> is the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúyes‚Äù</ENAMEX> in response to very nearly
all questions and declarations.  To be able to distinguish
among types of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúyes‚Äù‚</ENAMEX>Äîto be able to discern
when that word means <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúno‚Äù or ‚Äúperhaps‚Äù or ‚Äúyes</ENAMEX>, I
don't think so‚Äù‚Äîthat would mean that one had become
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">intimately Japanese</ENAMEX>.

            My marginally linguistic education merits some
corollary mention.  A local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>, I soon discovered,
pipes the strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúGoin' Home‚Äù</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX> and at quitting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.  When a <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> is removed by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, the organist plays <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúAuld Lang Syne</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  What
was I to do in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> bath at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
hotel (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a ryokan</NUMEX> ), besides wash?  Obviously, I could not
say much.  I sat soaking at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">about 100¬∞F</NUMEX>, while an exuberant
gentleman on my left, who was wearing his
washcloth draped over his head, gave me his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> words
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niagara Falls</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canyon</ENAMEX> .  The real cultural joy, however, lay in just immersing
myself in this aura, evoking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dante</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8¬Ω</NUMEX>,
and watching the occupants through the steamy haze as
they lathered, rinsed, and squatted on little plastic
stools to shave <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">before</TIMEX> low-hung misted mirrors against
the walls‚Äîall this before I slap-slapped back to my
room to enjoy dinner on the floor.  Finally, in this context,
I think back on what I derived from different kinds
of theatre: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bunraku, Kyogen, Noh</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kabuki</ENAMEX> .  Never
before had I been required to see and soak up that
drama which depends on a whole array of techniques
that have nothing intrinsically to do with words.  Here
was the proof.  I was compelled to pay strict attention
(for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four or five hours</TIMEX> at a time) to setting, lighting,
music, gesture, singing, pace of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-all presentation; to
this or that role's performance, costume, formal distancing
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noh</ENAMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX>-like intimacy
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kabuki</ENAMEX>); to traditional methods of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s playing women's parts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>'s anticipation
and shouted recognition of favorite plays and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> and
moments, tone of voice, etc.

            I find it difficult to imagine a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> more hospitable,
more generous with their time, than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
who took care of me.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> is renowned for
its gift-giving, as we all know.  My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> were always
calm and kind in putting up with the odd foreigner
who was bound to find larger signals gross and yet to
miss nuances altogether, coming across as deaf, dumb,
and functionally illiterate.  A final instance will make
my point.  In late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman librarian</ENAMEX> at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> took me to a flower-arranging exhibition.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early December</TIMEX> I received under my office door a
note from this young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> containing the following
excerpts: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúHow are you?  It is almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</TIMEX> I
haven't met you...and I'm worried whether you are
fine or not, or you are very busy...And <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> month
is left.  <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</TIMEX>!  I want to know much of you.
So if there are something interesting or something worried,
please give me a call at any time.  I should worry.
I have no knowledge to tell you about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>.  But I try
to help you.‚Äù That's what I miss: language and more.
         
         

            As his writings always do, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Lederer</ENAMEX>'s item
on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúAmerican Slurvian‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>] delighted me.  But his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äútypically American exchange</ENAMEX>,‚Äù beginning with Jeet
jet? , is incomplete.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coda</ENAMEX> is Nose <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">twirly</ENAMEX> .  And Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lederer</ENAMEX> will be happy to learn of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> of mine
who defined sanguine as `an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">penitentiary</ENAMEX>'
and of another who wrote of the peddle of a rose.

            Slurvian, however, is not confined to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  To
prove its dissemination, I offer the following from the
announcing system of the railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>:

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Le train de Montreal</ENAMEX> eh pret ass voir lay pass <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX>




         
         

            Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slurvian</ENAMEX> thus exists in both a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Germanic</ENAMEX> language
(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>) and a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Romance language</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>), must it
not therefore follow that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slurvian</ENAMEX> has its origin in the
common ancestor of both tongues, that is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Indo-</ENAMEX>stage?
That is to say, beside Indo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Indo-Hittite</ENAMEX>,
there must have existed an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indo-Slurvian</ENAMEX>.  As
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allah K. Swit</ENAMEX>, he must have been one of their
tribal deities.

            Declaim that line of transliterated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, and
you can listen to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Homer</ENAMEX>'s cunning selection of
words and genitive case capture the twanging release
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ulysses</ENAMEX>' silver bow.  Try the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> aloud, the way it
was meant to be read, and the hollow thump of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>'s gallop is in the sound as well as the meaning of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virgil</ENAMEX>'s words.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Onomatopoeia</ENAMEX> has a long, honorable, and pleasurable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">history‚Äîfrom Aristophanes</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">brek-ke-kex ko-ax</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ko</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ax</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kermit</ENAMEX>'s ribbet, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ribbet ‚Äîfrom majestic lines</ENAMEX> in
ancient epic poetry to simple, homey words like plop,
splash , and murmur .  In every language and time, the
sound and look of some words have given clues to their
meaning: their sound has suggested their sense.

            I have been intrigued now and again, starting as a
small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>, by words which seem to act in exactly the
opposite fashion, words which point away from their
meaning, words which seem almost mischievously to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mislead</ENAMEX>.  They suggest something other than what they
mean and in some instances do so all the more effectively
the more one knows about words and etymology.
Very often, of course, the misdirection lasts only for a
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, until training and traditional knowledge take
over.  The initial deception is no less real, and it is
precisely this that fascinates.  In parallel with the roots
of onomatopoeia (onoma `name' + poiein `to make or
do') I have christened the effect onomatoplazia: onoma
again + pladzein `to mislead or deceive.'  A fellow
word-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX>, flakier and less classically educated, suggested
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúoffomatopoeia</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and my own pragmatic bent
led at first toward ‚Äúanti-onomatopoeia.‚Äù  But it seemed
finally better to be analogous rather than cleverly
whimsical or totally derivative.  Thus, onomatoplazia .

            I offer the following as a sampler of words that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">delightfully</ENAMEX> and sometimes disconcertingly confuse.
They certainly did me when first I came across them.  I
usually hazard a guess in such first encounters, √†la the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">game of ‚ÄúDictionary</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  In all the following cases, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spelling</ENAMEX>, (apparent) roots, or sound of the word actively
suggest a meaning different from the true one.



noisome Has nothing to do with sound or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decibel</ENAMEX> level, but means simply unpleasant or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disgusting</ENAMEX>.  This was the word that first caught
my eye as the obverse of onomatopoeia.

highbinder Not a hip-length legging nor a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocky Mountain</ENAMEX> farm implement, but incredibly
enough a swindler or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crook</ENAMEX>, especially of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> variety.

macaronic Does not refer to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pasta</ENAMEX>; it is a
text which is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> vernacular.
(The computer age term, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚Äúspaghetti code,‚</ENAMEX>Äù
derives from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pasta</ENAMEX>-related idea as
macaronic, but more obviously so.)

polymath Does not describe my brownstone
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>, who is in fact a Ph.D. in mathematics
and who does indeed seem, at least to this
philosophy major, to know many kinds of
arithmetic.  The word, however, accurately
describes him as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> of much and varied
learning.

lowing Has no reference to height or the lack
of it, but is the sound commonly made by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldsmith</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">herd</ENAMEX>.  Admittedly, lowing is also
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">onomatopoeic</ENAMEX>.  Nonetheless, the initial trompe
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">l'oeil</ENAMEX> is there.

gingerly Neither denotes nor connotes spice
or snap or red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX>, rather just their opposites:
cautious, careful, wary.

bosom pressers, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast buffers</ENAMEX>, chick
sexers Not names for denizens of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">42nd Street</ENAMEX>, although the functions suggested
doubtless occur there if the price is right.  These
are job titles for, respectively:



a)  A clothing presser in the garment or dry-cleaning
industry who specializes.

b)  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> in a shoe factory who smooths and
polishes the forepart of the heel, called the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúbreast‚Äù</ENAMEX> of the shoe in the trade.

c)  An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poultry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> who identifles
the gender of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby chicks</ENAMEX> so as to keep males
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> apart (using a light!).

crepuscular Has always evoked for me images
of muscles or funereal trimmings or infected
tissue, instead of twilight or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>.

crapulous, crapulent What this suggests
would, of course, only occur to pre-pubescent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and has nothing to do with the real
meaning of drunkenness, overeating.

farthingale Neither a singing, nocturnal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coin</ENAMEX>, nor a storm of flatulence, but the light
wooden frame that puffed out milady's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX>
skirt.

pediculosis Not as foot disease nor the bad
breath of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, but just plain (and literally)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lousiness</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">impregnable Non</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> have been
known to think this means inconceivable.

hydrox It is wildly improbable that this is
the name of a cookie and not a many-headed,
bovine monster.

catamite Neither a light, fun sailboat, nor a
small, feline bug, but a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> used for
unnatural purposes.

newsprint As a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> I found it
unnatural that this means merely paper.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metapsychosis One</ENAMEX> of the finest of traps for
the knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">logophile</ENAMEX>: it has nothing to
do with some over-arching, society-wide
psychological illness like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX> or jogging.
Rather, it means mind-to-mind communication
without any observable intermediary‚ÄîESP.

metaschizotherium Not an over-arching,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX>-wide split personality, but mind
blowingly enough an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">extinct rhino</ENAMEX> with a fivetoed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">foot</ENAMEX>.

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-determined A misleading term in
psychoanalytic jargon used to describe a
condition with many causes (thus, ‚Äúmulti-determined‚Äù
would be better).  This would
logically appear to be a technical psychological
coinage useful for referring to a personality or
condition that is excessively rigid or stubborn.

analysand Another term from psychoanalese:
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of its words for `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.'  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This 19th-century</TIMEX>
neologism was obviously derived directly from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">-nd marker</ENAMEX> of the active gerund in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>,

than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> (the recipient, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> the

psychoanalytic theory's cherished insistence that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> actually does the analyzing in the
long run and thus is more truly the active

            These examples of onomatoplazia are a personal

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Galef</ENAMEX> has coined the term morox [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>] to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designate unintentional</ENAMEX>, inelegant oxymorons such as
many fewer problems, largely insignificant , and
barely clothed .  I collect solecisms of all sorts that I
hear on television broadcasts.  In a handful of slips
taken from the top of my stack, I found at least one
clear-cut morox: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX> is ‚Äúmuch more sparsely populated‚Äù
than eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin MacNeil</ENAMEX>
(MacNeil/<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lehrer News Report</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29 May 1986</TIMEX>).
And in several of these random instances of pleonasm,
truism, kinky syntax, malapropos metaphor, and just
plain dumb things to say, I perceived the moroxonic
spirit at work.  They did not, however, conform to the
letter of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galef</ENAMEX>'s definition‚Äîconjunct words of contradictory
literal meaning.

            Consider, for instance, the assertion, by a woman
being interviewed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC Today</ENAMEX> program, that
losing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">45 pounds ‚</NUMEX>Äúhas caused my life to turn around
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">360 degrees</NUMEX>.‚Äù  The newly svelte <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> surely had in mind
an about-face, not a pirouette, and was lithely (as she
might say) unaware that her expanded metaphor had
canceled the sense of her loss (a moroxish pun?).  Substantively,
if not literally, she made a morox.

            Now consider the lament of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC Today</ENAMEX> guest
that an undertaking had been frustrated ‚Äúand now
we're back to ground <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>.‚Äù  The inadvertent substitution
of ground <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> for square <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> , while luminously
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ludicrous</ENAMEX>, is not self-canceling and hence does not convey
the empty sense of morox.

            But what about a reference by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MacNeil</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Lehrer</ENAMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúsome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten thousand</NUMEX> black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diamond</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners</ENAMEX> [on strike in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>].‚Äù  The ambiguity
resulting from the conjunction of black and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> is akin to the distraction caused by optical illusions:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehrer</ENAMEX>'s phrase is both literally correct and literally
nonsense.  Is it at heart a morox?  It does not seem
to qualify as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">double entendre.</TIMEX>

            The onus for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">double entendre</TIMEX>, particularly if risqu√©,
properly lies with the perceiver.  But who can
resist a smirk when a female network broadcaster observes
that with respect to celibacy in the priesthood,
‚Äúthe pontiff remains <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  The howlers in my collection
that I most cherish, however, depend for their
charm on skewed syntax.

            My prize example was uttered by the incomparable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cher</ENAMEX>, during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a morning</TIMEX>-show interview.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúIt</ENAMEX> took
me really a long time to sort what was going on in my
mind out,‚Äù she said.  Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interviewer</ENAMEX> didn't bat an eye.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cher</ENAMEX>'s gem stood unrivaled until I recently heard
a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Monday Night Football</ENAMEX> savant announce to the nation
that despite confusion among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>, a touchdown had indeed been scored, because
‚Äúthe <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> of the ball broke the goal line.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Technically</ENAMEX>,
it is not a spoonerism.  Have such transpositions a
name?

            And as I look at the last slip in my random <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handful</ENAMEX>,
again I encounter a classificatory conundrum:



No <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> can go against [the laws of economics]
with impunity and get away with it.
            




         
         

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Conniff</ENAMEX>'s urbane account of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>'
putdowns of some of the great and not so great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> of
the world [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XIV,3</NUMEX>], he quotes a splendid passage from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Johnson</ENAMEX>'s poem on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, which culminates
with the words, ‚ÄúHere falling houses thunder on
your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, / And here a female atheist talks you dead.‚Äù
This, while perhaps not strictly an example of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>'s
denunciation, is certainly appropriate to the article
as a choice description of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Babylons</ENAMEX> of the
world.  While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conniff</ENAMEX> is doubtless aware of the
connection, he does not mention the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poem</ENAMEX> is throughout a very close and respectful pastiche
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juvenal</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satire III</ENAMEX>, on the city
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>.  (It should be noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> made the
same kind of adaptation of another poem by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juvenal</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Satire X</ENAMEX>, calling it <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Vanity of Human Wishes</ENAMEX>. )
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juvenal</ENAMEX> wrote his satire on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early years</TIMEX> of
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>, during the reign of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trajan</ENAMEX>.  Among the subjects he touches on in his poem
are street crime, unemployment, the degradation of
the welfare system, tacky urban renewal projects,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overcrowding</ENAMEX>, high rents and unscrupulous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlords</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">noise</ENAMEX>, vehicular traffic, congestion, even problems of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immigration</ENAMEX> and integration.  Under this last heading,
among the many alleged undesirables in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juvenal</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> is what he calls in a memorable phrase Graeculus
esuriens , the ‚Äúhungry little <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  In Johnson</ENAMEX>'s
poem this becomes a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúfasting Mounseer</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  Of the despised
and wily but accommodating <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, Juvenal
says In caelum iusseris, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ibit: ‚</ENAMEX>ÄúTell him to go to the sky,
and he will be off.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  For Johnson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Frenchie</ENAMEX> this becomes,
‚ÄúBid him go to hell, to hell he goes.‚Äù

            The passage in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juvenal</ENAMEX>'s poem which corresponds
most closely to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> quoted by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conniff</ENAMEX> is near
the beginning (lines <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7-9</ENAMEX>), where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juvenal</ENAMEX>, building up
to an ironic crescendo, shudders at the thought of:



...incendia, lapsus

tectorum <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">adsiduos ac mille</ENAMEX> pericula saevae
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urbis et Augusto</ENAMEX> recitantes mense poetas.

...fires, the constant collapse of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>,
and the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousand perils</NUMEX> of the savage <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> ‚Äî and
poets reciting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month of August</TIMEX>.
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX> had no trouble finding fairly exact counterparts
in his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> of the eighteenth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> for
many of the blights of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juvenal</ENAMEX>'s ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, but
there was really nothing to match the horror of the
amateur poetry reading in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trajan</ENAMEX>'s time; the closest
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analogy Johnson</ENAMEX> could come up with, an elegant one
under the circumstances, is his ‚Äúfemale atheist.‚Äù




         
         

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Henn</ENAMEX> gets a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">linguistic maggie</ENAMEX>'s drawers for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äú'Nam</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gook, Gung-ho</ENAMEX>: Nonsense‚Äù [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XIV,2</NUMEX>].  Taking
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aim</ENAMEX> at military slang because it is ‚Äúitinerant and erroneous‚Äù
misses the mark completely.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slang</ENAMEX> is slang precisely
because it does not adhere to the well-defined
meanings of standard usage.  Far from being ‚Äúmindless
and infantile,‚Äù slang in its wonderful vigor and versatility
allows us to express how we really feel about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>, places, and things.

            Military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">slang</ENAMEX> is first spoken by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>, who then
carry it into civilian life.  When enough <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
serve in uniform or when their slang is picked up by
the news media as it was in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX>,
it spreads to the general slang lexicon.  Examples
of this type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linguistic osmosis</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> , poop , honcho ,
gook , and gung-ho , all of which are now understood
by a substantial number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> who have never
been in the military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>.  The slang of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> military
generation passes on to the next, so the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marines</ENAMEX> who
called the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Koreans</ENAMEX> gooks in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '50s</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vietnamese</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gooks</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '60s and '70s</TIMEX> were the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguistic heirs</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marines</ENAMEX> who called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nicaraguans</ENAMEX> gooks in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>.

            I agree with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henn</ENAMEX> that the origins of slang
words are hard to pinpoint.  To call a brown-skinned
person a gook may be reinforced by words in his own
language, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mee Gook</ENAMEX> for ‚Äúbeautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>,‚Äù
or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX> Myguk (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">My = ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù + guk = ‚Äúcountry‚Äù</ENAMEX>),
but the word is extraordinarily derogatory, reinforced
by, if not derived from the common English
slang gobbledegook (the brown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s language) and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gook</ENAMEX> (his <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>).

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gung-ho</ENAMEX> , which once had a positive connotation,
is now used derisively among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servicemen</ENAMEX> to describe
`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> in a state of active and
zealous military enthusiasm,' and usually modifies
other words such as ‚Äúsonofabitch,‚Äù etc.  If <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> among
civilians it has come to mean a go-getter or a standout,
then it has undergone another permutation and that is
just additional proof of the language's dynamism.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gung-ho</ENAMEX> was popularized in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lt. Col.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fordyce Carlson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USMC</ENAMEX>, who picked it up from the
Red <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> when he was an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">8th Route</ENAMEX>
Army in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937-38</TIMEX>.  It is a contraction of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gung-yeh ho-dzo</NUMEX> ,
`industrial cooperation, 'and it caught on because
it is easy to pronounce, as in 'Nam or the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> .  'Nam
by itself is no more derogatory or misleading than
shortening airplane or telephone or gung-ho .

            The nuances of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> history, which Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henn</ENAMEX> finds so fascinating, were as useful to the men
who fought <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ho Chi Minh</ENAMEX>'s military <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">machine</ENAMEX> as the
facts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meiji Restoration</ENAMEX> to anyone who fought the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Empire</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>.

            Finally, I would remind Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henn</ENAMEX> that the point
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam war</ENAMEX> has nothing to do with whether we
called the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> 'Nam or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> .  It is that today
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> operate their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> out of our former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base complex</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cam</ENAMEX> Ranh
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay</ENAMEX> while the political language <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ho Chi Minh</ENAMEX> imported
from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> is now current through all of
Indo-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 February 1988</TIMEX>] reports that the
restoration of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 400-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">statue of Fame</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wilton</ENAMEX>

famous trumpets, weathered away from each hand but
not before prompting the expression `blowing your
own trumpet.' ‚Äù  To the best of our recollection, this
may be the only instance in which the origin of an
expression has been traced to a statue.  Corroboration
is not readily forthcoming from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX>, unless we

            A perfume called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Poison</ENAMEX> has appeared on the market.
Poison?  Who would want to wear such a scent?
Perfumes are supposed to attract, not repel (or so their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> would have us believe), and the name scarcely
evokes the image of an attractant.  The naming of perfumes
is a sensitive business: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> assumes that Equipage
is supposed to invite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> with foxhunting in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Devon</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>), not with the odor of sweaty saddles
and bridles or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> redolent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saliva</ENAMEX>.  The
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> reaction was that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Poison</ENAMEX> was another misspelling
(like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elizabeth Arden</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Millenium</ENAMEX>) and should have
been <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poisson</ENAMEX>; but, on reflection, the salability of a scent
promising the smell of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> seems a little remote.  Coco,
named for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mme. Chanel</ENAMEX>, does not smell from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocoa</ENAMEX>; I
haven't tried opium, but cannot imagine that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Opium</ENAMEX>
smells much like an opium den; and it is impossible to
guess at what <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the millennium</TIMEX> will smell like.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles</ENAMEX>

smell like stained hatbands on sweaty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cowpokes</ENAMEX>.  The
old standby, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuit de Paris</ENAMEX>, is all right (provided you hit
the right nuit).  Maybe we'll soon have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heroin</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heroine</ENAMEX>,

sure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> coming up with the last of these
will hear from you-know-who).  <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Grass</ENAMEX>, on the other
hand, might make sense for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chanel</ENAMEX>, for many of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chanel</ENAMEX> perfumes are cultivated at
Grasse, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">southern France</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanc√¥me</ENAMEX> has begun

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lexics</ENAMEX> (opposite of dyslexics) may read as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nois√¥me</ENAMEX>, a
singularly unimaginative name for a product: it ranks
with product names like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anusol</ENAMEX> (regardless of its pronunciation

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cannon</ENAMEX>  tabulated an attrition rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX> for
new meanings and new items originally admitted
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Merriam Addenda Sections</ENAMEX> which were cumulatively
included in reprints of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Webster's Third New</ENAMEX>
International <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of the English Language</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year</TIMEX> intervals in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966-81</TIMEX> period, but
then were excluded from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merriam</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,000</NUMEX> Words
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>).  Thus a surprisingly high <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98.5%</NUMEX> of the main
entries were retained in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Addenda Sections</ENAMEX> in
question.  These evidently possessed whatever qualities
of viability are required for an item to survive in at
least written <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> once it has experienced adequate
quantity and variety of printed occurrence to justify
initial listing in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place.  Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111</NUMEX> items that
were dropped, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> vanished in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just two to five years</TIMEX>,
suggesting that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early years</TIMEX> of a word's temporary
admission to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> lexicon are the most critical.

            During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this period</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hardcover versions of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Addenda Sections</ENAMEX> were published‚Äî <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Words</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>)
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,000</NUMEX> Words .  Now the hardcover version of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7873</TIMEX>-main-entry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Addenda Section</ENAMEX>, appearing simultaneously
as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Words</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>), permits an updating
of the statistics.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 164</NUMEX> previously listed main
entries did not appear in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Addenda Section</ENAMEX>,
some of which had first been listed as long ago as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>,
but a high <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> of which were first listed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX> and so
continue to indicate the critical quality of a new word's
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> in the lexicon.  If we compare these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">164</NUMEX>
deletions to the retained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7873</NUMEX> entries, we find that the
updated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> attrition rate only trivially raises the earlier
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX> rate.  With the thought that word <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> will
be interested in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">164</NUMEX> apparently unviable words,
we will list them below.  Since the word-formation
process by which they came into the vocabulary may
provide crucial information, the list is organized according
to that process.  Thus, we can see at a glance
that, for example, the highest mortality again appeared
in the new noun compounds, where <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX> of
the deletions were noun compounds, whereas the only
variant form was tabbouli .  The deletions consisted of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">134</NUMEX> nouns, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> adjectives, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> verbs, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> affixes.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taxonomy</ENAMEX> is that determined by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,683</NUMEX>-item corpus
described in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cannon</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>).

            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Longman Dictionary of the English Language</ENAMEX>

            This is a curious work.  I was under the impression
it was based on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Webster's Ninth Collegiate Dictionary</ENAMEX> ,
and indeed it was; but there are so many improvements
and changes that the absence both of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman</ENAMEX>
copyright notice and of any identification of a
specific editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> are a bit mysterious.  One is
drawn to conclude that the work is the product of
some disembodied corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>.  To be sure, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">names‚ÄîHeather Gay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian O'Kill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katherine Seed</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Whitcut‚</ENAMEX>Äîappear on the Acknowledgements
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">page</ENAMEX>, but so do names of a lot of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> (like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Kermode</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melvin Bragg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clement Freud</ENAMEX>, Germaine
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clive Jenkins</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Street-Porter</ENAMEX>)
whose direct connection with the book at hand would
seem to be much more remote.  Having myself dealt
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> linguists and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> in other fields
who contribute something to the preparation of accurate
structure and definitions to a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>, I think I
can safely say that such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are only indirectly responsible
for the quality of a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>, and the major
responsibility for a book of such complexity rests with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>.  But <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> for such a massive
work?  I suppose it is possible.  In any event, it seems
unfair not to have listed them on the title page, assuning
(as I presume we must) that their contributions
were more or less equal.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ninth Collegiate Dictionary</ENAMEX> [hereafter
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>], despite many improvements over its forebears, still
suffers from shortcomings ultimately traceable to the
aberrational lexicography reflected in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s Third
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unabridged</ENAMEX> .  Although direct comparison between the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Longman Dictionary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX> [hereafter
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>] and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> reveals many similarities, there are
many differences, too.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> gets the impression that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> used the good stuff from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> and
substituted their own, much better material when
they encountered some of the bad stuff.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">L</ENAMEX> was based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> , but a comparison,
albeit superficial, reveals a number of differences,
to wit:

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.  The headword is syllabified in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> , not in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> .  In
older dictionaries the words are syllabified mainly to
help in pronouncing them; latterly, syllabication has
been used largely to find where a word can be hyphenated
at the end of a line of text, though, judging by
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>, one would be sore
put to believe that a dictionary had ever been within
the grasp of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>, proofreaders, or the programmers
who wrote the hyphenation programs for
the automatic typesetting many of them now employ.
The syllabication of headwords is not an important
feature in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> dictionaries: the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Collins English Dictionary</ENAMEX> ,
which offered an elaborate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">system</ENAMEX> in its first
edition (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>), set the words solid in its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> edition
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>), but I am informed that the major portion of
the correspondence received at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collins Publishing</ENAMEX> concerning
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictionary concerns</ENAMEX> this change and is critical
of it.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.  The pronounciation systems differ.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> 's set of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">symbols</ENAMEX> is somewhat closer to that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phonetic Alphabet; W</ENAMEX> follows the system used in the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Unabridged</ENAMEX> , which is too complicated for my
taste, being replete with diacritics.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> uses a version of
what I call the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúMoo Goo Gai Pan‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚ÄúAh-oo-gah‚</NUMEX>Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, favored by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> because, though primitive,
it is virtually transparent: unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> system,
which requires even a casual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to deal with distinctions
between a ƒÅ, \?\, √§ and a\?\; (rendered in L as a , ay ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> , ah , and ow , respectively).  The description of the
pronunciation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is much fuller in the front
matter of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> , but, as the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who read the
front matter of dictionaries seem to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> (who
are enjoined to under pain of death) and other lexicographers,
the absence of comprehensive coverage of the
subject in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> would not appear to be a serious omission.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> follows the (useful) practice of listing a shortened
pronunciation key on each right-hand <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">page</ENAMEX>; L 's failure
to do so is a disadvantage, notwithstanding the simplicity
of their system, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> must ferret about to
find the description given on page xxii to clarify any
question.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> would be well advised, in future printings,
to give a complete pronunciation key on the inside
(front) cover of the book, an easily accessible place that
is at present unused.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> lists etymologies near the beginning of those
entries that have them, directly following the inflected
forms (if any); L places them at the end of the entry.
As surveys have shown that etymological information
is the least often sought after, making the average user
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wade</ENAMEX> through the etymology before getting to the definition
has always seemed pointless and irritating to
me; besides, it is unlikely that the serious, consistent
seeker of etymological information is likely to use anything
but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> or a major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">etymological dictionary</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> lists the ‚Äúdate of the earliest recorded use in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
...of the sense which the date precedes.‚Äù  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second</ENAMEX>
Edition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Unabridged</ENAMEX> follows a
similar practice, and I find it speculative, spurious,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specious</ENAMEX> except for the documentation of relatively
recent coinages.  Such information is very likely to be
misinterpreted by the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>, who does not approach
a dictionary with a critical eye.  For example,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> shows for leeway <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the date 1669</TIMEX>; from my experience
with even above-average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, that is usually taken to
mean that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1669</TIMEX> was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time that leeway appeared
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> it did not exist; the next,
Presto!  Change-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>!, it sprang into view on a printed
page.  That is nonsense, of course; but even if the users
remain keenly aware that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1669</TIMEX> is the date only of the
earliest written evidence, of what use or importance is
that to them?  Moreover, as we in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dictionary biz</ENAMEX> are
only too well aware, an earlier citation might be found
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>, making the information obsolete.
I feel less strongly about a designation like ‚Äú17c‚Äù which
seems usefully vague.  To give <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äú1604‚</NUMEX>Äù as the date for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lemonade</ENAMEX> after giving ‚<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Äú15c‚Äù</TIMEX> as the date for lemon
might give one the impression that it took Englishmen
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 200 years</TIMEX> to find out how to make lemonade (or
what to name what they got when they squeezed a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lemon</ENAMEX> and mixed the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>).
Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scots</ENAMEX> are likely to give them more credit than
that.  Also, the date given for the adjective lemon (as in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lemon</ENAMEX> flavor, lemon color ) would draw <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to the conclusion
that those retarded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of the language
needed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some 300 years</TIMEX> to use the noun as a modifier.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mercifully</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> has omitted such dating.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.  Another odd thing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> etymologies, carried
over into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">L</ENAMEX>, is the practice of using ‚Äúmore
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">at‚Äî‚Äù</ENAMEX> as a cross reference indicator.  For example, at
lento , after showing it to have come, via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italian</ENAMEX>, from
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> lentus `slow,' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reads ‚Äúmore at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LITHE</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  But if
you look up the etymology for lithe you discover only
that the original form of that word ( lithe in Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>)
is ‚Äúakin to... <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> lentus slow.‚Äù  My objection
to the form of the reference is that its wording suggests,
‚Äúthere is more information about the etymology
of lento to be found under lithe ,‚Äù but that does not
actually turn out to be the case: all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> has
learned is that lento and lithe are (or might be) cognates.
In the event, why not just say ‚Äúcogn: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lithe ‚Äù</ENAMEX>
under lento and the reverse under lithe ?  (This latter
piece of information is unaccountably lacking.)

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.  Compare the entries for literally in the two
dictionaries:



<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">W 1:</ENAMEX> in a literal sense or manner: ACTUALLY
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"><</ENAMEX> took the remark Àú > < was Àú insane > <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 : in</TIMEX>
effect: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIRTUALLY <</ENAMEX> will Àú turn the world upside
down to combat cruelty or injustice‚ÄîNorman
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cousins ></ENAMEX>

usage Since sense 2 is the opposite in meaning
of sense <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, it has been frequently criticized as a
misuse.  Instead, the use is pure hyperbole intended
to gain emphasis, but it often appears
in contexts where no additional emphasis is
necessary.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L 1</ENAMEX> in the literal sense; without metaphor or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">exaggeration 2</ENAMEX> with exact equivalence; verbatim
< follow the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">instructions Àú > 3 ‚Äî</NUMEX> used to intensify
a metaphorical or hyperbolic expression
< she was Àú ‚Äî tearing her hair out >; disapproved
of by some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>
            

            To be sure, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> usage note, even with its verbosity
and the oxymoron ‚Äúpure hyperbole,‚Äù is more
helpful than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> 's cryptic ‚Äúdisapproved of by some
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">speakers‚Äù</ENAMEX>; but the definitions are better in L because
they assume that if a user does not know the meaning
of literally , then that of literal is unlikely to be that
obvious.  On the other hand, ‚Äúfigurative or exaggerated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">expression‚Äù</ENAMEX> would probably have been a simplified improvement
over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúmetaphorical or hyperbolic expression,‚Äù
which might be tough going for someone who
had to look up literally to begin with.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">L</ENAMEX> will be far better off if spared the
technique of defining in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> , carried over from the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Unabridged</ENAMEX> , in which the full explanatory definition
is abandoned in favor of a scattering of synonyms
set in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMALL CAPITALS</ENAMEX>, which, more often than
not, are likely to lead the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> who has the paitence to
pursue them to other words defined in the same inept
manner.  There is a difference between using a word
in a phrasal definition and suggesting it as a‚Äî
presumably substitutable‚Äîsynonym.  In the present
case, ACTUALLY is such a loosely used ‚<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Äúfiller‚Äù</ENAMEX> word in
the language (like really , I mean , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">y'know</ENAMEX> , etc.) as to be
almost useless as a substitute (except <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúliterally‚Äù</ENAMEX>).

            In general, the definitions in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> have been clarified,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">simplified</ENAMEX>, and made more precise in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> .  Also, the
citations in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> have either been omitted, where unnecessary,
or paraphrased, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> are not given.  I
have never understood why, in a dictionary of this size,
W ever thought it useful to give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of citations,
especially inconsistently: who among the general,
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">college-dictionary-</ENAMEX>using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of today
knows the identity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Cousins</ENAMEX>?  Is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. G. Rickover</ENAMEX>
being held up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> as a paragon of English
usage?  What is the significance in citing anonymous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Longfellow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. P. Smith</ENAMEX>, or giving no citation
at all?  The treatment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> is erratic, to say the least.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>.  The entry list in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> seems to be fuller than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> ,
but a quick direct comparison is not easily done.  In
one interval checked, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> reveals <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montague</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Romeo</ENAMEX>'s
family name), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montmorency</ENAMEX> (a kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cherry</ENAMEX>), Montrachet
(<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>), monuron (a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">herbicide</ENAMEX>), moon-eye (a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>), moon-eyed (open-eyed), and moonflower , as
headwords not in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> ; the same interval in L reveals
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">montbretia</ENAMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montessorian</ENAMEX> (teaching method),
month of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montilla</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-mony</ENAMEX> (suffix) Moog synthesizer ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">moon daisy</ENAMEX> (the oxeye), moon-faced , moonglow ,
and moonrat , which do not appear in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> .  Leaving
aside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, which are differently
distributed for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, the only
significant omission from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montrachet</ENAMEX> , while the
important words omitted from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montessorian</ENAMEX> ,
month of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-mony</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moog</ENAMEX> synthesizer , moon-faced ,
and moonglow .  The last word is not in the RHD
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> , but it should be, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">L</ENAMEX> citation is from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller</ENAMEX> and the word also appears in the lyrics written
for the popularized rendition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tchaikovsky</ENAMEX>'s 5th
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symphony</ENAMEX>.  It should also be noted that idiomatic expressions
(e.g., once in a blue moon , listed under
moon in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> ) may be listed elsewhere (under blue moon
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> ) and that others (e.g., over the moon `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elated</ENAMEX>') are
not much used in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX>.

            On the whole, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> can draw their own conclusions
about the breadth of coverage; as for me,
I should (regrettably) sacrifice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montrachet</ENAMEX> to gain
others.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>.  There are lengthy usage notes and synonym
studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> that do not appear in L at all or in greatly
abbreviated form, sometimes mercifully so, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>
occasionally succumbs to prolixity.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Notwithstanding,</ENAMEX>
such features are valued by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> and cutting them
could be a disadvantage.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> has illustrations (better than those in the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> Unabridged ); L has none, but it must be noted
that other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> dictionaries lack them also, so L
need not have included them purely for competitive
reasons in the main market it is intended to serve.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>.  Both dictionaries list abbreviations and biographical
and geographical entries in separate sections
at the back, a practice I have never liked.  Experience
(and a moment's thought) shows that names of people
and places occur with equal, sometimes greater frequency
in the language than a very large percentage of
the words listed in dictionaries of almost any size (except
the smallest), and on that ground they should not
be treated as nonwords or as being outside the pale of
lexicon.  Also, it is awkward to find <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Glasgow</ENAMEX> or Shake-speare
in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary and Glaswegian</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shakespearian</ENAMEX> in another.  Finally, fictional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and
places are listed in the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of those dictionaries
that include them, but real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and places appear
in the appendices; as it may be assumed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> look
up things they do not know, the immediate assumption
is that they ought to come to a reference book
already aware that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Homer</ENAMEX> was a real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> (despite
speculation to the contrary) and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> was both
real and, as ‚Äúthe <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>,‚Äù fictional;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fundamentalists</ENAMEX> will be disturbed to discover that most
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> are treated as fictional.
It seems silly to separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gruy√</ENAMEX>®re the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> from
Gruy√®re the place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX> whence it comes‚Äî
indeed, the latter is not even an entry in the geographical
sections of either dictionary.  Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>
geographical listings seem more complete: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> lists
Aylesbury , which, through some grievous, egregious
fault, is not in the geographical section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">L</ENAMEX> but
does appear in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A-Z</ENAMEX> section (because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX>).

            10.  Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> has, in addition to the names,
abbreviations, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only a few</NUMEX> pages of miscellaneous
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">materials‚ÄîHandbook of Style, Ten Vexed</ENAMEX> points in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English grammar‚</ENAMEX>Äîand some tables of moneys,
weights and measures, etc., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> has short sections on
Foreign Words and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phrases</ENAMEX> (most of which are dispensable),
Signs and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Symbols</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Style</ENAMEX>, as well as one
of those interminably boring listings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colleges</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Universities</ENAMEX> that clutter up most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> college
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionaries</ENAMEX>.

            11.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1876</NUMEX> pages, W <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1562</TIMEX> pages.  A rough comparison
yields the following:


                             <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman   Webster</ENAMEX>
depth of column              <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> picas               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> picas
width of column              67mm                   72mm
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>/line                                     <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX>
lines/column                                        104
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> total (approx.)   <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 million             22 million</NUMEX>


            

            No allowance has been made in the above calculations
for the pronunciation key appearing on each odd-numbered
page of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> .

            12.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> is, of course, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W American</ENAMEX>.
But for other reasons they are not directly comparable.
The entry for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> in L reads as follows:



adj of or being a type of algebra in which logical
symbols are used to represent relations between
sets, and which is used entensively in the
theory of computer programming < Àú expression
            

            Under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Boolean</ENAMEX> algebra , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> has the following:


a set that is closed under the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> commutative
binary operations and that can be described by
any of various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> of postulates all of which
can be deduced from the postulates that an
identity element exists for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>, that
each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> is distributive over the other, and
that for every element in the set there is another
element which when combined with the first
under one of the operations yields the identity
element of the other operation<under the=operations
of taking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">intersections</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>, the
subsets of a given set form a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> algebra
            

            The definition in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third Unabridged</ENAMEX> was a model
of clarity compared with that.  Focusing on these two
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">definitions</ENAMEX>, it must be conceded that naive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> who
did not know the meaning of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> or of Boolean
algebra before going to either dictionary are unlikely
to come away any the wiser.  But the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> reads like
gobbledygook while the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> tries to provide some basic
notion of what is involved and where it is applied
while, at the same time, gently notifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> that
they are going to have to seek elsewhere for a proper
definition, the understanding of which requires far
more backgound in mathematics and logic than can be
assumed in the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>.

            Lexicographers constantly face problems of defining
terms that, in some instances, might require a
brief essay to explain and far more specialized knowledge
than can reasonably be expected from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>.
The source of the problem lies in the fact that there is
no law forbidding ordinary mortals to bandy about
terms like theory of relativity which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only a few</NUMEX> people
in the world truly understand: to be sure, it is impossible
to conceive of writing a definition for it that would
fit into a dictionary's procrustean requirements.  The
dilemma can be resolved either by attempting a definition
(which no one will understand) or by providing a
superficial pass at a definition couched in language
suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> can find no succor in the work
in hand.  I prefer the latter approach, though I have
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> thought it might be only fair to mark such entries
with some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> (like a death's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>).

            Conclusion?  I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman</ENAMEX> is a fine dictionary,
superior to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> , but I have been careful
not to compare it with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX> , which remains
my favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">dictionary</ENAMEX> for reasons that
modesty forbids my detailing here.

               Computational Lexicography
            

            I recently purchased a new computer, and, because
it operated on a system different from the one of
my old computer, I asked a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> to recommend
a word-processing package that I might.find useful.  I
was particularly interested in one that would allow me
to designate a variety of typestyles during keyboard-ing,
ideally one that showed the styles on the monitor
as the text was being typed.

            Those who are familiar with computers or do not
want to know about them should skip to the next paragraph.
For those who are unfamiliar with computers
and the need for a word-processing package, I should
explain that when you buy what is fondly call a ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù
computer, you get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> pieces of equipment
(though they may be combined in some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> or
makes): a rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> with some slots in the front
and sockets in the back, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monitor</ENAMEX>, which is nothing but
a small TV set, and a keyboard, which looks like an
ordinary typewriter keyboard but, in many <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> sold
today, has a number of additional keys alongside those
for the familiar alphanumeric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>: on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>, nestled
among some control keys on the right side is what is
called a ‚Äúnumber pad,‚Äù which resembles the key arrangement
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sees on a small adding machine or calculator;
on the left side is a double <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> keys
marked ‚<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ÄúF1‚Äù</TIMEX> through ‚ÄúF10‚Äù which, when pressed alone
or in combination with another key, perform certain
functions, some of which are useful, others of which are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evidently</ENAMEX> thought useful by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> but
which I never use.  These boxes come with wires (called
cables for some reason) that allow them to be connected
to one another and into a power source.  The trick is
that they will not do anything unless and until you have
installed what is called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disk Operating System</ENAMEX>, which
comes with the machine.  After it has been installed, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOS</ENAMEX>, as it is called (once identified, nothing in computerese
is ever called by its full name again: a Personal
Computer becomes a PC; a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disk Operating System</ENAMEX>
becomes a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOS</ENAMEX>; if it is made by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> called
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MicroSoft</ENAMEX>, it is called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MS/DOS</ENAMEX>), performs certain functions,
though rarely any that anyone but a computer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> would want to perform.  In order to do something
useful, you have to buy a program, which is a
package consisting of a number of diskettes and a manual.
A diskette is also called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúfloppy‚Äù</ENAMEX>; the reason for
the name is not immediately apparent (nor why the
item is called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúdiskette‚Äù</ENAMEX>, for that matter), but all
becomes clear.  The so-called diskette is a flat black
square of rather tough plastic with a hole in the middle
and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an oblong</TIMEX> slot on each of the flat sides; it is said to
be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5¬º inches square</NUMEX>, but that is a lie: as the only person
who probably ever measured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these things, I can
tell you it is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 3/16 inches square</NUMEX>; that may seem irrelevant,
but it is only the beginning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Great Deception</ENAMEX>.
Inside this square plastic casing (which you should
never open) is a flimsy flat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">black plastic papadum</ENAMEX>.  If
the diskette is placed in the slot of the machine, a motor
engages the center of the disk inside and spins it around
at a great speed so that portions of it are exposed as they
pass by the oblong slot, allowing them to be ‚Äúwritten
on‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúread‚Äù by some device inside the box.  The diskettes
that contain programs have information on them
that the computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúunderstands‚Äù</ENAMEX> and translates into a
number of commands that make the machine do certain
things.  The things done depend on what kind of
program is on the diskette.

            I bought a word-processing program called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Framework</ENAMEX>
II.  It is quite versatile and, as I required, allows
me to create certain kinds of files in which I am able to
style the text as I wish, but I shall not go into that here.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Framework</ENAMEX> is sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ashton-Tate</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Silicon-Valley</ENAMEX> concern
that makes quite good programs but, like most of
the ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, produces such abominable
manuals with directions for using the programs that
they have to maintain a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several dozen</NUMEX> ‚Äútechnical
personnel‚Äù who are on duty <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 12 hours</TIMEX> a day beginning
at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six in the morning</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> time) merely in
order to answer the questions of confused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>.
This failing appears to be endemic to the industry: I
recently spoke with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Okidata</ENAMEX>, a manufacturer
of a very good computer (laser) printer, who
told me that his technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> answers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60,000</NUMEX> telephone
queries <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>.  I pointed out to him that if they
made available a proper manual the number of calls
could probably be reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX>.  Only the telephone
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> was profiting from such ineptitude.

            But the foregoing is all preliminary and background
to the main theme.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> performed
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Framework</ENAMEX> is in a program subroutine
called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Spelling Check</ENAMEX>.  I do not need a spelling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">checker</ENAMEX>,
but I have found it extremeely useful as a means for
proofreading text that has been keyboarded into storage
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Framework</ENAMEX> program.  The way it works is
this: after completing an article, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> of a book, or
whatever it is that I am working on, I press a few keys
and the program automatically scans every word of
text, comparing each with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúdictionary‚Äù</ENAMEX> contained in
the program.  It is not really a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>, of course, in
the sense that is lacks definitions; it is merely a word
list.  I have not seen the word list, but, from the directory
of programs I can invoke on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monitor</ENAMEX>, I know it
contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 223,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 37,000</NUMEX>
words.  Being a computer, the machine performs this
comparison checking very, very rapidly: it takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a</TIMEX>
minute to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúproofread‚Äù a file containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 7,000</NUMEX>
words.  The proofreading is slightly moronic, for the
program cannot alert the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to an error like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúan‚Äù</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúand</ENAMEX>,‚Äù because ‚Äúan‚Äù is a valid word in its memory; still,
it is better than nothing.  If it encounters a word that is
not in its repertoire, it offers a choice of actions: at the
stroke of a key or two you can ADD the word to the list;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GO</ENAMEX> ON and ignore the word entirely; or EDIT the questionable
item (by correcting a typo, for instance).
There is another option called, SUGGEST, which, if invoked,
lists up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> words that you might
have had in mind when you wrote the one that offended
the machine, and this brings me to the point of
this article.

            It seems unnecessary to point out that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Framework</ENAMEX>
cannot have a very sophisticated list of words if it has
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 37,000</NUMEX> in its memory, but I thought it might be
interesting to see what substitutions were evoked by
SUGGEST.  In each listing below, the boldface word is
the word at which <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Framework</ENAMEX> stopped, offering to
SUGGEST a substitute; the words following are the substitutions
it suggested.  Where ellipses occur, I have not
bothered to copy down the entire list of offerings, selecting
only those that struck me as odd, either because
of the incongruity of the choice or because I could not,
in the wildest flights of dyslexic, schizophrenic-fancy,
imagine the criteria employed in arriving at the selections.
I am fully aware that some of the words in my
text are not everyday items you find about the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>,
but I included those anyway; attention is drawn, particularly,
to the suggestions for the more common
words.

            ...Well, you get the idea.  I had some fun substituting
the program's words in my sentences and in simple
sentences, too.  For instance,



All arachnids and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> are arthritic.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> are developing an interstate

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Cauthens</ENAMEX> has devoted his life to resurfacing.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX> was unmentionable when the verdict
was read out.

I certainly do enjoy some bordellos or beauties
with my steak.
            

            As if the preceding were not enough, I also noticed,
assuming that the program did not stop and
offer choices if the word was in its memory, that oligopsony
is in, but psychoneurotic is not; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Winston</ENAMEX> is in,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Churchill</ENAMEX> is not; isosceles is in, scalene is not.

            It is a good thing that the technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MicroSoft</ENAMEX> is not being asked to field questions about its
Spelling Check; I am not sure I would want to hear the
answers.

            Finally, it might be worth mentioning that the
program has the capacity to store in a temporary
memory buffer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</NUMEX> words (proper names, for
instance) that it has identified as not stored in its <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time such a word is encountered, if
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> chooses GO ON, the program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> it and
will recognize it when it recurs, obviating the need to
repeat the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GO</ENAMEX> ON command.  For example, if you are
writing an article on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Churchill</ENAMEX> , not listed in the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37,000</NUMEX>-entry dictionary, the program will stop at the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> encounter; but once you have signaled it to GO ON,
it will pass over any further repetitions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Churchill</ENAMEX> .
When the temporary memory has been filled, the following
message appears on the screen, which makes
me wonder why I am relying on the program at all:



NO <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">FURTHER WORDS CAN BE REMEMBERED FOR CORRECT</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MULTIPLE OCCURRANCES OR FOR GO</ENAMEX> ON.

Spelling check, check thyself!
