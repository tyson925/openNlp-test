            A letter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> once accused The [<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> and
Mail , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> of record, of setting a
new record for splitting an infinitive.  A front-page article
ended in the phrase, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Premier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> said that in order
to after which the notice SEE <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. A16</ENAMEX> was inserted, and
on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A16</NUMEX> the sentence was indeed completed as
promised: balance the budget, expectations would have
to be lowered.  That is some split!

            However, writing letters to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> to complain about
split infinitives is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s play for the truly obsessed.  As a
self-confessed obsessive when it comes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>'
errors, my own pet <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">peeveâ</ENAMEX>€”one which all the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX>
news services and most of its major news magazines
seem to be guilty ofâ€”is leaving diacritical marks off foreign
words.  To their credit, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> news services (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reuters</ENAMEX>)
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Observer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian</ENAMEX> , and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economist</ENAMEX> , are usually quite careful to get it right.  Sometimes
these omissions are genuinely trivial.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montreal</ENAMEX> is
quite acceptable; MontrÃ©al would be pretentious except
perhaps in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>.  But sometimes they are not trivial at
all, because a diacritical mark can change the pronunciation,
the spelling and therefore even the meaning of a word.

            In general, diacritical marks are all those little jots
and tittles that appear over, under, and even through various
letters.  We don't have many in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>; the only common
one I can think of offhand is the diaeresis (as in the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> dots over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">naÃ¯ve</TIMEX> ). where it indicates that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> vowels
side by side are not a diphthong but separate, distinct
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vowels</ENAMEX>.  IsraÃ«l is an example which is not seen much any
more; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ZaÃ¯re</ENAMEX> is seen occasionally; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HaÃ¯ti</ENAMEX> is common in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, where it is pronounced as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> syllables, but
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> standard seems to be <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haiti</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> syllables).  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> still insists on coÃ¶perate .

            Related to diacritical marks are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> constructs, the
ligature , which is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> resulting from tying together
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more standard letters, and the digraph , which is
a special case of the ligature .  The term ligature is usually
reserved for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">printer</ENAMEX>'s conventions (that is, where combinations
like fi, ffi, fl , and ffl are linked together to form a
single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>), whereas the digraph .  while graphically
tying together <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, actually represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
diphthongs which were common in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>: after the invention
of printing, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin/Romance</ENAMEX> ae became Ã¦,
and oe became Å“.  These are almost never seen in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, but they are still occasionally encountered in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and other varieties of English influenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
practice, although it is usually the unligated form that
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> encounters, not the digraphs.
The most common example used to be <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> encyclopedia
vs. traditional non-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">encyclopaedia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">encyclopÃ¦dia</ENAMEX> ).
However, as even the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> spell this word the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> way
now, the best examples of current <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>/non-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> dichotomies
in the use of the digraphs can be gleaned from the world
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> and science, as in gynÅ“cology/gynecology,
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hÅ“matology/hematology, Å“sophagus/esophagus, Å“strogen/</ENAMEX>
estrogen, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cÅ“sium/cesium, Å“dema/edema, Å“strus/estrus,</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pÅ“diatrics/pediatrics .</ENAMEX>  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, one rarely encounters
in common usage the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">spellings</ENAMEX> listed, but, while
they continue to be widely used by medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>,
even that practice has come under <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> influence.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diacritical</ENAMEX> marks can be broken down into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accents</ENAMEX>, which affect, roughly speaking, pronunciation
only; and umlauts, which affect spelling as well as pronunciation.
As already mentioned, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is relatively
sterile when it comes to diacritical marks; true <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> can
best be struck in foreign fields, where the accent grave,
accent aigu , and the circonflexe .  The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> accents are used
in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> to change the value of e , which is the most common
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vowel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> (as in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>) and which comes in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many</NUMEX> varieties as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX>'s soupâ€”hence the need for
some kind of regulation by diacritical marks.  The circonflexe ,
on the other hand, is really a sign of orthography ,
not pronunciation, being a reminder of a dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sâ</NUMEX>€”it
is usually there for historical reasons but connoting a reason
which has long since ceased to make sense and which
modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> have probably been blithely
unaware of.  Thus the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> Ã®le reminds us that the word
was once spelled isle , from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> insula; the name of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight month</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AoÃ»t</ENAMEX> , reminds us that it came from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">augustus</ENAMEX>; and Ãªtre betrays its origins as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> esse with
the same orthographical scar.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, being a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>-derived language, is also very
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX> in digraphs, which are often still retained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, but are dying out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quebec</ENAMEX>: cÅ“ur and Å“uvre are
common examples.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> has no pure accents that I can think of (other
than the occasional diaeresis in foreign proper nouns,
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IsraÃ«l</ENAMEX> ), but it has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> very common ligature and,
of course, the umlaut which is much like a digraphâ€”in
fact, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> are essential to proper spelling, and
it is for that reason that a dropped umlaut may be seen
as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offense</ENAMEX>.  The common ligature in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> orthography
is the esszet (Î², <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²</NUMEX>) and there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> vowels which
can take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">umlaut (Ã¤</ENAMEX>, Ã¶, and Ã¼ ).  The esszet (pronounced
ess-tset) was formed when mediÃ¦val (for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> read
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">medieval</ENAMEX>) humanists got carried away and tried to force
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GrÃ</ENAMEX>¦co-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mould</ENAMEX> of grammar and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spelling</ENAMEX> (a disease that spread to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Isles</ENAMEX>, too).

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, the sigma that is written in the middle of a word
(Ïƒ, called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medial sigma</ENAMEX>) is different from the sigma at the
end of a word (Ï‚, called final, or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal sigma</ENAMEX>).  In
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">mediÃ¦val Latin</ENAMEX> the two s's were also differentiated: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">âˆ</NUMEX>« was
the medial s, and s the terminal s.  This convention persisted
until recently.  In microfilms of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1881</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">census</ENAMEX>, I have come across names like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agneâˆ«s</ENAMEX>, who was
sometimes noted as being a dreâˆ«smaker.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, this
double-s, âˆ«s, eventually evolved into Î².  The diphthongs
ae, oe, and ue appear so often in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> that mediÃ¦val
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scribes</ENAMEX> started writing the e above the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> vowel, something
like this: \?\.  As they were writing with flat-pointed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pens</ENAMEX>, which tended to emphasize the vertical strokes
(especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fraktur</ENAMEX>, the so-called gothie script of old
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>) the little superior e came to be represented by
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> short, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vertical strokes</ENAMEX>, which then became <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> square
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dots</ENAMEX>.  Then, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germany</ENAMEX> adopted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> letters during
the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">pre-World War II</ENAMEX> era, they became <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> round dots.
I have always thought that the Ã¼ was a perky little characterâ€”draw
a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> around it and you get that ubiquitous
Californianism, \?\.

            
The convention in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is to transcribe the
umlautâ€”to restore, as it were, the lost <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">e. Hence</ENAMEX>, the
Hanseatic port of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LÃ</ENAMEX>¼beck is properly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luebeck</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
Similarly, the esszet should be transcribed as ss, never
as B, which I see often.

            
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scandinavian</ENAMEX> languages also have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> similar
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> umlauts: besides the Ã¤ and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ã¶</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX>),
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norwegian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> have Å“ (a + e as in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>),
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norwegian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> also have Î¸ (o + e) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
use a (a + a).  The rules for transcription are similar to
those for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> words: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alborg</ENAMEX>=<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aalborg; KÎ¸benhavn</ENAMEX>=
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koebenhavn</ENAMEX> (of course, in this case there's a perfectly
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">acceptable English</ENAMEX> equivalent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Copenhagen</ENAMEX>).  As an interesting
aside, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> alphabetizes words as if the umlauts
were transcribed (so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">KÃ¶ln</ENAMEX> would come before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kohl</ENAMEX>, for
instance), but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scandinavian</ENAMEX> languages treat their
umlauts as trans-z <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> (so in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX> phone books,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ã–dlund</ENAMEX> would come after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZetterstrÃ¶m</ENAMEX>).

            
News <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> that drop umlauts might deserve some
sympathy; given the isolation of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North Americans</ENAMEX>, the
assumption is easily made here that the umlaut is an extraneous
character that can be droppedâ€”as accents in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
often are when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> words are transcribed into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Englishâ</ENAMEX>€”without
doing bodily harm to the word in question.
However, dropping umlauts is less forgivable than dropping
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accents</ENAMEX>, because accents describe pronunciation,
and anyone who is familiar with the word will know how
it is supposed to be pronounced, regardless of the accent.
If you have heard the name of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jean ChrÃ©tien</ENAMEX>) pronounced correctly, or if you are sufficiently
acquainted with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> to know this fairly common
name (which means <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian</ENAMEX>), you do not need to
know that an acute accent is usually put over an e to indicate
that it is a long e in an unstressed syllable.  Hence,
its omission will probably not stop you from pronouncing
ChrÃ©tien correctly (that is, with the emphasis on the second
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">syllable</ENAMEX>).

            
Umlauts are not simply accents, however: they are
fundamental to the spelling of a word and should always
be transcribed as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ae</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">oe</ENAMEX>/ue (or aa in the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scandinavian</ENAMEX>
a) in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> sets that do not provide umlauts.
In any case, many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scandinavian</ENAMEX> place names
have English equivalents: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Munich</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MÃ¼nchen</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cologne for KÃ¶ln</ENAMEX>, the aforementioned Copenhagen
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KÎ¸benhavn, Gothenburg</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GÃ¶teborg</ENAMEX>, and so on.
However, I recently read an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Press</ENAMEX> account of
a neo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> demonstration in a place called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nurnberg</ENAMEX>.
The problem here is that this is neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish nor fowl</ENAMEX>.  It
is not the correct <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> name for this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, which is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nuremberg</ENAMEX>, and it is not the correct <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> name, which
is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NÃ¼rnberg</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuernberg</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> strongly suspects that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> simply did not know the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> name for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NÃ¼rnberg.</ENAMEX>  Yet more confirming evidence to the pessimists
amongst us who lament the deterioriation of standards
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> and abusers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother Tongue</ENAMEX>, especially
cis-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>.

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford Companion</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCEL</ENAMEX> ) is missing an s at the end of its title, for it
has headings for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than four hundred</NUMEX> varieties of our

<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Black Vernacular English</ENAMEX>, etc.
Some of the varieties are unfamiliar, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Babu English</ENAMEX>,
a mode of address and reference in several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indo</ENAMEX>-Aryan
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">languages</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hindi</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> working forrajahs,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">landlords</ENAMEX>, etc.

            My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> tongue is one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> listed in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCEL</ENAMEX> , and I am constantly being reminded of the peculiarities
of my usage.  After giving an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> telephone
receptionist my phone number, I added, My local is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">222</NUMEX>.
Your what?  she retorted.  I quickly corrected myself:
My extension is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">222</NUMEX>.  I left a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX> customer
perplexed when I told him that I would try to find an item
at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of our filials , instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subsidiaries</ENAMEX> .  I am guilty of
speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Quebec English</ENAMEX>.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quebec</ENAMEX>, it is taken for granted that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> affects
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> hears expressions like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">le</ENAMEX> snack bar, chequer
(instead of verifier ), and un towing a tow <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX>.  In the
business world one encounters a myriad of Anglicisms
like meeting, cash flow, down-size , and business itself.
The presence of these borrowings make some Quebecois
feel that their language is under threat.  More and more,
however, the flow is not unidirectional: most English-speaking
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">monolingual Quebecer</ENAMEX> will use metro for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX>,
dÃ©panneur for convenience <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> , and caisse populaire
instead of cooperative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> .  The following demonstrates
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> influence on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Quebecois</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>:



The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>) at the polyvalent (high
school) believed that scholarity (education) was being
affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> consecrating (devoting) more
time to manifestations (demonstrations) about the
dress code than to their notes (grades).  During his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conferences</ENAMEX> (lectures), their inattention was hurting
their apprenticeship (learning of the subject matter).
He also felt he was getting collaboration (cooperation)
from his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">confreres</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anglophone</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>),
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Francophone</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>), and Allophone
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of neither <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>) in better
serving the collectivity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>).  He thus had
a rendezvous (meeting) with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Director-General</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monsieur Gendron</ENAMEX>, and stated that it
was a primordial (essential) consideration that some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> be let go before they reached permanence
(tenure) under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">syndicate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>) agreement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monsieur Gendron</ENAMEX> wrote back saying that he had
requested a subvention (grant) in the annex (appendix)
to his planification (policy) budget to the confessional
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">denominational</NUMEX>) school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> in order that formation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modalities</ENAMEX> (training methods) could be created to
make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> more dynamic animators (group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>).
            

            Although terms like collaboration, rendezvous , and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annex</ENAMEX> might be used in non-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quebec</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">contexts</ENAMEX>,
they read like inappropriate choices from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">synonym dictionary</ENAMEX>,
and cooperation, meeting , and appendix seem
more natural.

            The trend towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallicization</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in
Quebec coincides with the introduction of pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>
legislation around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years ago</TIMEX>, and the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
has gained in prestige as a result, making it more likely for
Gallic loanwords to appear in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  Anglophones are
speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> to a greater extent at home and at work,
creating a situation in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> term becomes more
familiar than the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  Thus, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglophone</ENAMEX> might use
the word demand when he means ask, reparations when
he means repairs, and remark when he means notice,
because he is constantly employing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demander</ENAMEX>, rÃ©parations ,
and remarquer when speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX>.

            These faux amis (false <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>), as they are called,
are confused both by Anglophones speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> and
Francophones speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  They are also among
many of the words likely to have their meanings changed
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Quebec English</ENAMEX>.  For example, rÃ©sumer does not mean
to resume but, as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> know from their adoption
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rÃ©sumÃ©</ENAMEX> for curriculum vitae, to summarize; and decevoir
means to disappoint, not to deceive.  Not many Anglophones
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quebec</ENAMEX> today use resume and deceive in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> sense, but over time I suspect that such usages
will increase.

            It is often hard to know where <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> and French
begin and end.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franglais</ENAMEX> includes such classics as hot-dog
steamÃ© all dressed , and a rock music review which declared
that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s appeal was to male white trash de vieille
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">souche</ENAMEX>.  Vieille souche is a term that refers to old stock
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quebecers</ENAMEX>.

            To those who bemoan the loss of the chastity of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> language, all I can say is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> never was
a virgin: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> is essentially mutated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> corrupted by
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaulish</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Germanic</ENAMEX>, to name a few of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seducers</ENAMEX>.  Even the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> , owes its
name (as does <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> ) to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX>.  Language
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purity</ENAMEX> is a myth.  The reality is that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> and French
have been borrowing from one another since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 1066</TIMEX>.
Ironically, some of the dreaded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anglicisms</ENAMEX>, like rosbif
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> , were originally Gallicisms that had penetrated
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>.
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> of Wordsmiths



            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Updike</ENAMEX> remarked that language has bloomed
from the infinite fumblings of anonymous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.  We
meddle constantly with our linguistic roots, grafing suffixes
and slang with equal abandon, and toss the resulting
hybrids about us with the carelessness of toddlers flinging
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pablum</ENAMEX>.  Thus are new words born, whether as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX>'s
lingo or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wino</ENAMEX>'s mutterings.  But new language blooms
also from the not-so-careless utterances of certain
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, particularly in the field of speculative
fiction.  At least since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Carroll</ENAMEX> intrigued his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jabberwocky</ENAMEX>, there have been writersâ€”Robert
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heinlein</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seuss</ENAMEX>, to name twoâ€”who deliberately
minted new words.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A Clockwork Orange Anthony</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burgess</ENAMEX> invented an entire dialect (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nadsat</ENAMEX>, a Russified
version of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>): I could sort of slooshy myself making
special sort of shoms and govoreeting slovos like Dear dead
idlewilds, rot not in variform guises and all that cal.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Herbert</ENAMEX> was also no slouch at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">wordvention:</ENAMEX>
chaumurky, sietch , and heighliner are examples from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dune</ENAMEX> .  Much of it is fresh, serviceable language, not merely
humdrum technical derivatives or the names of gadgets
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>, and has certifiable potential to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
language.  Grok , for example.

            But for sheer variety, quantity, and above all charm
of his neologisms, I submit that none compare with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jack</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vance</ENAMEX>, a.k.a.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Holbrook Vance</ENAMEX>.  As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Rawlins</ENAMEX> said,
...to make up words that carry just the right scent, that
strike the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> as new and familiar simultaneously, is
extremely challenging, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vance</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> at it.
It is not unusual for a single novel to have fifty or more newly
created words; in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Face</ENAMEX> there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost a hundred</NUMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showboat World</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollon Zamp</ENAMEX> advertises for musicians
who ...play instruments of the following categories:
belp-horn, screedle, cadenciver, variboom, elf-pipe, tympany,
guitar, dulciole, heptagong, zinfonella .  In Galactic
Effectuator , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vance</ENAMEX> tosses off gangee, sprugge, cardenil
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX>, raptap , and shatterbone in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> orgiastic paragraphs.

            Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vance</ENAMEX>'s neologisms are nouns, the majority
of them <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>.  Others designate
musical instruments or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, denote magical spells,
crystallize cultural concepts or rituals, or express metaphors.
Some, like skak and merrihew , are footnoted with lengthy
explanations about the sociology of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">magical creatures</ENAMEX>.
Terms like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monomantic Syntoraxis</ENAMEX> and Tempofluxion
Dogma reflect his droll skepticism toward religion.  Some
are wonderfully playful, such as <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">pinky-panky-poo</NUMEX>, or simply
wonderful, such as scurch and dreuwhy (the latter
alleged to have been drawn from the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welsh</ENAMEX>).  The
adjectives are always vivid: the colors rawn and pallow
and smaudre (which also function as nouns), and squalmaceous
or halcositic.  He also gives us verbs (disturgle,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">skirkling</ENAMEX>), a few articles and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinal numbers</ENAMEX>, and even
a sprinkling of interjections and appellatives.

            The words may also be categorized according to
whether they are intended to be <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  Clearly most
of them are; we are expected to read them without recoiling,
though we may grope for a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>.  Others are
implicitly or expressly taken from an imaginary tongue such
as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paonese</ENAMEX> or the idiom of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dirdir</ENAMEX>, or that of the
Water-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> (e.g., the shibbolethic brga skth gz).

            
But the most interesting method of analyzing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vance</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neologisms</ENAMEX> is by etymological speculation, which falls into
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly five</NUMEX> categories that shade into one another like
colors in the spectrum.  I list these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> in order of
decreasing distance from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>:

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.  Those that appear to have come into the world de
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">novo</ENAMEX>, from stem to suffix.  We can think of no corollary,
and feel little or no resonance with known wordsâ€”dyssac
(an herb liquor), thawn (a bearded cave-dweller),
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bgrassik</ENAMEX> (translation uncertain).

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.  Those that tantalize us with faint echoes of known
words.  The morphemes are rather familiar, but overall
we cannot place them: harquisade (a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> with
glass foliage), marathaxus (a scale from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">demon Sadlark</ENAMEX>).  Some of these are ... <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hauntingly</ENAMEX> familiar
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">growths</ENAMEX>, like catafalque <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and hangman <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>,
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Dowling</ENAMEX> put it. 
Submulgery, ensqualm, bifaulgulateâ€”the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> runs to the dictionary and is surprised
to find them absent.  Some sound so real that they
flit past like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterflies</ENAMEX> or called strikes, only to awaken
us in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the middle of the night</TIMEX> with the realization that
they cannot be: halcoid, subuculate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manciple</ENAMEX>.
Close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousins</ENAMEX> of such words float unbidden into our consciousness.
We think of subterfuge and skulduggery
to explain submulgery; coaxed by ensqualm, we recall
ensnare, qualm, and squall; for bifaulgulate,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ungulate</ENAMEX> and a host of words beginning with the prefix
bi- come to mind.  We are crowded with conjecture.

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.  Portmanteau words, the most fascinating and treacherous.
Here the stems are reasonably certain, but they
ignite an extended metaphor.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thasdrubal</ENAMEX>'s Laganetic
Transfer was the spell used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magician</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iucounu</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">banish Cugel</ENAMEX> on his search for the euphoriant cusps in
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eyes of the Overworld</ENAMEX>.  One might easily overlook the
hidden word lagan goods thrown into the sea with a buoy
attached.  This is certainly a reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Firx</ENAMEX>, the painful
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parasite</ENAMEX> installed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cugel</ENAMEX>'s liver to keep his mind on his
task.  Moreover, the phrase is a reminder of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vance</ENAMEX>'s love
of sailing.  Another example is gleft, a kind of phantom,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of which stole part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guyal</ENAMEX>'s brain while his mother
was in labor.  Surely this word arose from glia, a class of
brain cells, and theft.

            
An especially intriguing case is pleurmalion, the tubeshaped
device used by the sorcerer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhialto</ENAMEX> to discern the
location of a precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">textual prism</ENAMEX>, even from great distances
in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> and time.  We cannot avoid recognition of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> pleura side or rib.  And mustn't the -malion
fragment refer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pygmalion</ENAMEX>, the legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> who fell
in love with his sculpture of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> and persuaded
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aphrodite</ENAMEX> to bring it to life?  We are struck by the insight
that the pleurmalion relates to the lost prism as the biblical
rib to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, bringing it (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">her</NUMEX>) into view and thus to hand.
They must be reunited.

            
Any doubts that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vance</ENAMEX> actually thinks along these
lines are dispelled by a revealing footnote to the word murst
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 16</ENAMEX> of the last book in his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Demon Prince</ENAMEX>
series: The meaning of this word, like others in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Book</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dreams</ENAMEX> [the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">villain</ENAMEX>'s childhood notebook can only be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conjectured</ENAMEX>.  (Must: urgency?  With verst: in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Russia</ENAMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX>?  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farfetched</ENAMEX>, but who knows?)

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.  In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> are words that draw clearly from identifiable
roots and appendages and combine them according
to traditional rules: calligynics, malepsy, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gynodyne</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photochrometz</ENAMEX>.  These are mix-'n'-match suits of clothes.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old English</ENAMEX> roots are readily discernible
(though I cannot explain the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-etz</ENAMEX> in the last case),
and generate few if any metaphorical overtones.

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.  Compounds, straightforward <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alloys</ENAMEX> of real words,
sturdily welded or hyphenated: sagmaw, trapperfish, sadapple,
bumbuster, and the delightfully macabre ghostclutch.
He has even been known to do this in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX>:
garde-nez nose-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protector</ENAMEX> is a logical amalgam of garder
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> and pince-nez: An extravagant garde-nez of
gold filigree clung to the ridge of his nose.

            
Such compounds can seduce us into spurious assumptions.
The term elving-platformâ€”a birthing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species hyrcan</ENAMEX> majorâ€”implies the existence of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">verb</ENAMEX> to elve, give birth to an elf! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vance</ENAMEX> can indeed be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of the ridiculous.  (Meanwhile we should not overlook
that hyrcan major is also a fine portmanteau word,
with its references to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hyrcania</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of the ancient
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Persian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parthian</ENAMEX> empires, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ursa Major</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear</ENAMEX> constellation.)

            
Even some of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vance</ENAMEX>'s proper nouns hint strongly at
the existence of daily words: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Pancomium</ENAMEX>, the
name of a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>, suggests a more generalized category
of encomium; reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dylas Extranuator</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a spaceship</NUMEX>)
compels us to ask what extranuate might
meanâ€”perhaps strain in wonder?  A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> called the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catademnon</ENAMEX> (pungent gust of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> syllables!)
is certainly not merely a confection, reminding us as it does
of condemn, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Agamenmon</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parthenon</ENAMEX>, all of which
relate directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vance</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emphyrio</ENAMEX> and his tragic fate.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vance</ENAMEX> has achieved something extraordinary: the
invention of nearly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1700</TIMEX> interesting new words, a number
sufficient to justify his own dictionary. 
In contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burroughs Dictionary</ENAMEX> 
and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Dune Encyclopedia</ENAMEX> include many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> and places and are thus actually
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">concordances</ENAMEX> or encyclopedias rather than true dictionaries.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vance</ENAMEX> is still busily, incorrigibly at work.

            Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neologisms</ENAMEX> remain in their literary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">greenhouses</ENAMEX>,
to be enjoyed only by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.  But some have
escaped and spread like <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> to become part of the language:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heinlein</ENAMEX>'s grok, for example.  How many of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vance</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coinings</ENAMEX> will infiltrate our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> gab?  Will we send our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies skirkling</ENAMEX>, or drink skull-busters at the corner
bar?  Will our windows be made of translux?  In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Languages</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pao</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vance</ENAMEX> explored the notion of using created
languages as instruments of social engineering.  Let
us hope that his whimsical wordsâ€”Whimsicantâ€”are
already doing just that.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Problem</ENAMEX> of Names



            Recently a brisk, chummy young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> whom I had
just met asked me what my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> name is.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>,
I told her.  Well, now, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>...,she began.

            Nobody calls me <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>, I said gently.  I then explained
to her that it is not so much the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-naming itself that
some of us older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> do not like but the doing it in
a casual way by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> we do not know.

            I told her that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who know me call me Jock .
I have carried that label from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first week</TIMEX> of my
life.  I was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winnipeg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Hospital</ENAMEX>.  My mother
was <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> by birth; my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> an immigrant from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Nurses</ENAMEX> in the hospital teased him about his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accent</ENAMEX> and began referring to me as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wee Jock</ENAMEX> .  My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> picked it up and I have lived with it ever since.
When I was in high school some of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> took delight
in referring to me as an athletic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporter</ENAMEX>.  (I like the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter De Vries</ENAMEX>' novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Forever Panting</ENAMEX> , who
spoke about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Jock Rousseau</ENAMEX>.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wayne W. Dyer</ENAMEX>, one of the better-selling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gurus</ENAMEX>
in pop psychology <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX>, gave this advice in
his book, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pulling Your Own Strings: Always</ENAMEX> deal with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> name basis unless they make it clear
that they need to be addressed in some other way.  Why
did he use the word need with respect to those of us who
prefer not be called by our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> names by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who do
not know us at all well?

            I read somewhere that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> was given the name
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camery</ENAMEX> because her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX> had served in the Queen's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Own Cameron Highlanders</ENAMEX>, a regiment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
army.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> pointed out how unfortunate that was,
as camery , he said, is a disease of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> in which
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pimples</ENAMEX> appear on the palate.  I was skeptical of that.  So
to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> dictionaries.  No mention.  That <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>,
I knew, liked to do a little leg-pulling in his writings.
Then I went to the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>: camery is an obsolete
word and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> had simply quoted that dictionary's
definition.  Now I worry a little about my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, a splendid
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secondhand Toyota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Camry</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. L. Mencken</ENAMEX>, in one of his more crotchety moods,
said this: The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rotarian</ENAMEX> was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> to call

university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> said this about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Milton</ENAMEX>: I would
venture to assert that no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human being</ENAMEX> ever called
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">him Johnnie</ENAMEX>.

            In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> who appears in two roles in a
play is given as his name for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> one, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spelvin</ENAMEX> .  An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Georgina</ENAMEX> .  I understand that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>
he is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Plinge</ENAMEX> .  I do not know what name they
give to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. G. Wodehouse</ENAMEX> has delighted many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> with
the names he gave to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> in his wonderful humorous
novels: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeeves</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bertie Wooster</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pongo Thistleton</ENAMEX> ,
and many others.  About the naming of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> he said
this: Odd how important story names are.  It always takes
me about as long toget them to my satisfaction as it does
to write the novel.

            Many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> I found in an abandoned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farmhouse</ENAMEX>
a copy of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX> issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Presbyterian</ENAMEX> , a periodical
published in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> and devoted to spiritual uplift and
the sale of patent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX> and trusses.  In it the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">commented</ENAMEX> briefly on a recently published pamphlet
written by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Shaw</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">On Going to Church</ENAMEX> .  He gently
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">castigated Shaw</ENAMEX> for indulging in one of the modish
foibles of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> by calling himself <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. Bernard Shaw</ENAMEX>
rather than use, in the good old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> manner, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George B.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaw</ENAMEX> .  Then he suggested to his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ministers</ENAMEX> that
 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Melchizedec Smith</ENAMEX> looks more impressive than either
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John M. Smith</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. M. Smith</ENAMEX> .

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years ago</TIMEX> I read a brief report on some research
that had been done at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> by a team
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX> in which they discovered that the way
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> sign their names and use it for public purposes
tells something significant aboutthem.  They said that if
you use <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Doe</ENAMEX> you probably are a very conventional
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>.  A simple <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Doe</ENAMEX> suggests that you are rather
outspoken, an assertive loner.  ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Shaw</ENAMEX> was the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">playwright</ENAMEX>'s usual byline.)  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John James Doe</ENAMEX> tends to be
rather proud, and he likes to stand in the limelight.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Doe</ENAMEX> ,
on the other hand, is likely to be excessively modest.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. J. Doe</ENAMEX> is generally a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who likes to remain in the
background, a shy oneâ€”like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. A. Davidson</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. James Doe</ENAMEX>
is a go-getter, and likes to think himself a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of considerable
importance.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. Allen Smith</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">humorist</ENAMEX>, called this, and exemplified in his own usage,
parting one's name on the side.)

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Some years ago</TIMEX> I noticed a tendency among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
preachersâ€”a tendency I noticed also in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canadaâ</ENAMEX>€”to adopt
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-name pattern.  This particular foible may have
been initiated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Waldo Emerson</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1803-82</TIMEX>), who
had been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preacher</ENAMEX> before concentrating on being an
important literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Emerson Fosdick</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1878-1969</TIMEX>)â€”notice that middle name, although it may
not be significantâ€”was the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preacher</ENAMEX>
of his time.  And, of course, we must not overlook <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Peale</ENAMEX> .  Would not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. Vincent Peale</ENAMEX> have given
the eminent positive<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-thinker</ENAMEX> a bit more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>?  (I read
somewhere that a striptease artiste in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> a
few <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> adopted as her stage name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norma Vincent</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peel</ENAMEX> .)
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Turning To Nod Goodbye</ENAMEX>



            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyberspeak</ENAMEX> is ubiquitous.  Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cyberwords</ENAMEX>, for
example, download, laptop , and modern are
euphonious, enriching the language.  They are not
loanwords, but here in their own right.  Other terminologies,
especially that of metrication, are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cuckoos</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nest</ENAMEX>.  In
turfing out the venerable words, they deprive the language
of colour and warmth

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Bennett</ENAMEX> said that any change, albeit for the
better, is always accompanied by drawbacks and discomforts.
One regrets the inevitable parting with words that
have served us since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Saxon</ENAMEX> times and were here
before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred</ENAMEX>.  Many arrived with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William the Conqueror</ENAMEX>.
Others were absorbed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s time, often
from the great literatures of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Soldiers</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sailors</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> brought home idioms from distant lands.

            Some words die and are forgotten, but many of those
which wrapped themselves about us like comfy old coats
are stolen off our backs.  So we don <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hectares</NUMEX>, litres, and
milligramsâ€”but not, I hope, without turning to nod goodbye
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">respectfully</ENAMEX> to the earliest form of English bequeathed
by our ancestors.



I like that ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saxon</ENAMEX> phrase, which calls
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial</ENAMEX>-ground God's<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-Acre</NUMEX>!

[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longfellow</ENAMEX>: God's<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-Acre</NUMEX>]
            

            Only in phrases like God's<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-Acre</NUMEX> and broadacre does
acre still mean a field of sorts.  Correctly, an acre is a measure
of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4840 square yards</NUMEX> of land, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old English</ENAMEX>
aecer was the fieldâ€”a piece of land cleared for ploughing
or grazing.  An acre's precise definition varied according
to time and place.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> was an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">acreman</ENAMEX> who paid
a firma , or fixed rent.

            Later an acre was a strip of open field, large enough
to be ploughed by a yoke of oxen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>.  To help the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ploughman</ENAMEX> measure his <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4840 square yards</NUMEX>, a chain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">yards</NUMEX> long was laid along the field's headland, showing
the width to be ploughed.  From here he would plough
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">furlongs</ENAMEX> (i.e., a furrow long), of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">220 yards</NUMEX>.
Come <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, the ploughman might mark out the village
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">cricket</ENAMEX> pitch, having borrowed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>:
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 yards</NUMEX> exactly.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Persons</ENAMEX> of a certain age learned by rote that eight
furlongs make <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mile</NUMEX>, and since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9th century</TIMEX>, a furlong
has described <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an eighth</NUMEX> part of an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> mile, regardless
of its agricultural definition.

            From time immemorial we have used our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> for
measuringâ€”by foot , for example.  An ell , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Saxon eln</ENAMEX> ,
was a rough reckoning, being the distance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crook</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> to the end of the longest finger, the elbow being
where the bow or bend occurred.  Bow is from an old
verb, bugan to bend, and is at the root of rainbow, bow
(tie), and bow (and arrow).

            Using our fingers, we counted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens</NUMEX>.  Numbers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> emphasize this finger-reckoning.  After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> sheep
had passed him, the shepherd had used up all his fingers.
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">etymologists</ENAMEX> believe that endleofon is the
Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> form for left after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>, one left over.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twelve</NUMEX> in Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twa-lif</NUMEX> or twelf , when two
(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than ten</NUMEX>) were left.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twa-lif</ENAMEX> represents the elements
in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and leave.

            To tell meant to count (as in telling the beads of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rosary</ENAMEX> ); a tale was a reckoning.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L'Allegro</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milton</ENAMEX>
writes:



And every shepherd tells his tale
Under the hawthorn in the dale.
            

            In telling his tale, every shepherd counted his sheep
as they went past him.  We still tell the time.

            A hand-span is the stretch from thumb to little finger.
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>, span new was the term applied
to cloth immediately after taking it off the spannans , or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stretchers</ENAMEX>.

            A rod, pole, or perch was measured by a stick, the
Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> rodd being <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5Â½ yards</NUMEX>.  The area of an acre was
standardized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edward I</ENAMEX> as being land <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> rods long by
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> rods wide.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yard</ENAMEX> (OE gyrd, geard ) is of superior stock: the earth
itself was middangeard middleyard, being the place
between the abode of the gods and the abode of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giants</ENAMEX>.
As a suffix it survives in churchyard, dockyard , and
shipyard .

            Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1150</TIMEX>, Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> time was reckoned
by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX>, not by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Anglo-Saxon</ENAMEX> language
flourished in lands where <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> were long and the days
fleeting periods of light.  The light of learning, notes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simeon Potter</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Our Language</ENAMEX> , shone more brightly
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northumbria</ENAMEX> than anywhere else in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.  Northumbria
was then on the periphery of the civilised world.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> rightly regard as archaic my
use of fortnight , this word being a survival of the old way
of reckoning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>, by using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX>-night.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>
uses sevennights for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> when the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> weird
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sisters chant:</ENAMEX>



<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Weary se'ennights</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> times <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
Shall he dwindle, peak and pine.

[<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Macbeth i, 3, 20</ENAMEX>]
            

            Reckoning by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> is a relic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celtic</ENAMEX> custom
of starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sunset</ENAMEX>.  In the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Book of Genesis too</ENAMEX>,
evening always precedes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>: The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> and the
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first day</TIMEX>....  The time between light
and dark, twilight , is of the same root as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, twain, twixt ,
and tween , from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old English twa</ENAMEX> .

            A certain drama is attached to words prefixed by
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night -</TIMEX>.  From Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> galen to sing comes nightingale ,
simply the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.  Deadly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nightshade</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">woody</ENAMEX> nightshade , the narcotic plants commonly known
as belladonna and bittersweet, have their origins in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">nihtscada</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">niht night</TIMEX> and scada shade.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">English mare</ENAMEX> in nightmare means demon or devil.  Tennyson
writes of the black bat, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> of the
foul womb of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.  Better sleep might have resulted from
taking a nightcap or grog (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">whiskey</ENAMEX> preferred) before bedtime,
helped too by wearing a night cap .

            Small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> of timeâ€” <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minute</TIMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hour â</NUMEX>€”are
borrowed from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> secundus, minuta , and hora.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Year</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month, week</TIMEX> , and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> are Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> gear, monao, wice ,
and daeg .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Day</ENAMEX> has poetical overtones.  The daisy flower
closes its pink-tipped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">petals</TIMEX> (lashes), and goes to sleep when
the sun sets.  In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> the petals open to the light.
Anglo-Saxon for daisy was daeges <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eage day</TIMEX>'s eye.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> uses dayspring for the beginning of the
day; also for the commencement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Messiah</ENAMEX>'s reign:



The dayspring from on high hath visited us.

[<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Luke i, 78</ENAMEX>]
            

            Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> springan (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> springen ) became
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">spring</ENAMEX> , but an older word for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that season</TIMEX> marks a period
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Church Year: Lent</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saxon</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> was lencten .
Lenten <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> being frugal and stinted, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> has
lenten entertainment in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hamlet</ENAMEX> , a lenten answer in
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Twelfth Night</ENAMEX> , and a lenten pye in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Romeo and Juliet</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Lent lily</ENAMEX> is the older name for the daffodil.



When daffodils begin to peer,
With heigh! the doxy, over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dale</ENAMEX>,
Why, then comes in the sweet o' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>,
For the red blood reigns in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX>'s pale.

[A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Winter's Tale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ii, 1</ENAMEX>]
            

            Of unknown origin, doxy is variously the low term
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sweetheart</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mistress</ENAMEX>, female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tramp</ENAMEX> or beggar, plaything
or paramour [toy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>?], even a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>.  In the West
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> were called doxies.

            The oldest words, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, live, fight, love,
sleep , and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> , relate to home and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.  They also
include the counting of time and measuring of space, the
meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, the working of the soil and caring
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts</ENAMEX>.  The language was not called Anglo-Saxon
by those who spoke it, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Englisc</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engle Angles</ENAMEX>,
Anglo-Saxon being simply the earliest form of the language.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Burroughs</ENAMEX> said that words are an around-the-world,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ox</ENAMEX>-cart way of doing things, awkward instruments,
eventually to be laid aside.  He was thinking of
the space age and no doubt would have included the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyberworld</ENAMEX>.  But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Morrison</ENAMEX>, writing in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, says he knows a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> who has taken to writing
his stories in longhand, revising them laboriously in
ink, and only then tapping them into the computer.  When
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morrison</ENAMEX> asked why he did that, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> answered, So
that posterity can compare the various drafts.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>
would surely have understood the need.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dharuk Words In English</ENAMEX>



            When the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1788</TIMEX>, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 250</NUMEX> separate languages
spoken by the indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX>.  During the 200 years
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> occupation these have declined in use, to the
point where not more than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about twenty</TIMEX> are active, in the
sense that they are being learnt by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and
cover aspects of the everyday life experienced by those
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.

            These active languages tend to be those spoken in
the north and the west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, in those parts of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aborigines</ENAMEX> have been most able to
retain their traditional way of life.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> languages that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> encountered, those once spoken on the east
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, survive only as they were recorded by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> and have been reconstructed in the light of
later acquired knowledge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> languages
as a whole.  Paradoxically, it is these languages that
have contributed most to the lexicon of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
Not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than about 400</NUMEX> words have been borrowed
altogether, and yet of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 60</NUMEX> come from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dharuk</ENAMEX>,
the language which was spoken on the site now occupied
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> and not much beyond it, which
existed in an inland and a coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dialect</ENAMEX>.

            Although there are still a few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dharuk</ENAMEX> descendants
in the vicinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX>, and these may still use a handful
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dharuk</ENAMEX> words, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dharuk</ENAMEX> effectively ceased to function
as a language by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-19th century</TIMEX>.

            What then survives?  Names of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX>, names
of implements, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, a few miscellaneous
names of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwellings</ENAMEX>, ceremonies, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> identified by sex
or activity, striking features of the environment, and a
handful of pidgin terms suggestive of an only rudimentary
communicative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX> are characterised by their distinctiveness.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great South Land</ENAMEX> was to prove extraordinarily
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX> in new <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, some of which, like the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kangaroo</ENAMEX>, had an irresistible novelty about them; at the
same time they were as numerous as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>
and as useful to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.  The wallaby and the wallaroo were,
like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kangaroo</ENAMEX>, large marsupials which the Aborigines
hunted; the koala was also a marsupial but arboreal in habit
and sufficiently unique in appearance to have had the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> liken it to a bear, a sloth, or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> in their naming
of it; the wombat was a heavy, thickset marsupial
sometimes known as a badger because of its burrowing
habit.  The only animal immediately recognisable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
eyes was the native <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> or dingo , and the distinction
was early made between the domesticated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>, or
dingo , and the wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>, or warrigal .  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the small number
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> identified were the boobook , an omnipresent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">owl</ENAMEX>, and the currawong , a large, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crowlike bird</ENAMEX> whose
curiosity would have brought it to notice.  The name of a
good eating <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, the wollami or snapper, on which the early
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> were frequently dependent, was again an understandable
borrowing.

            When it came to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, the same sort of criteria
were observed: the waratah, a strikingly beautiful red
flower which has become the floral emblem of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New South</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wales</ENAMEX>, was soon identified, as were the burrawang , a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palmlike</ENAMEX> plant very common in the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>, and the
kurrajong , a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> that yields a useful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibre</ENAMEX>.

            The name of the dance ceremony corroboree , probably
the most immediately observable characteristic of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peoples</ENAMEX> regarded as savages, which had both a religious
and an informal social form, was readily adopted, as was
koradji a wise elder or, as he was often described, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witch doctor</ENAMEX>.

            Weapons like the boomerang, the hielamon (a wooden
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">shield</ENAMEX>), the nulla nulla (a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>), the waddy (ditto), and
the woomera (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a spear-thrower</NUMEX>), were identifiable to the
earliest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> as were also gin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, myall , which distinguished
a wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Aborigine</ENAMEX> from his civilised or tame
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, gibber a stone, and gunyah a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwelling</ENAMEX>.  But the
largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of words that characterise <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early</TIMEX> period
are those that clearly formed part of a language used for
the limited communication that took place between the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX>: cobra <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, mundowie foot, bogie to bathe
or a bathing place, crammer to steal, nangry to sleep,
patter to eat, budgeree good, cabon big, cooler angry,
jerron afraid, narangy little, muny very, baal a negative,
and cooee a call or to call.

            Of the several word lists compiled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Fleet</ENAMEX>, as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> group of convict-laden <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> was
known, that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lieut</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Dawes</ENAMEX> is the most ambitious,
attempting a grammar of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dharuk</ENAMEX> as well as a vocabulary.
But such a resource is more an indication of what
was available to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> than a record of what they
actually used.  For that we must turn to their accounts of
life in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> and to the words which they adopted,
which they use more or less unselfconsciously as part of
their language as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX>.

            And here there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> observations to be made.
First, the words used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aborigines</ENAMEX> were seldom as
attractive to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX> as descriptive <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> names
that emphasised the perceived resemblance between the
new and the known and familiar, and so made for more
certain communication.  Thus, distinguishing epithets like
colonial, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX>, wild, black, brown, green , and gray qualify
names of common Old World species like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apple</ENAMEX>, ash,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oak</ENAMEX> , and pine to build a considerable and understandable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vocabulary</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, a positive effort needed to be made
to ascertain the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> name, and experience showed
that the geographical range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dharuk</ENAMEX> was extremely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX>: the fact that a new set of names came into use
as one crossed the boundary of another <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> language
must have mitigated against borrowing.  <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the
Aborigines were widely thought of as backward and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uncivilised</ENAMEX> and, while this attitude persisted, their nomenclature
carried no great recommendation.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Thoughts on Collective</ENAMEX> Nouns




            Could the thoughts of the estranged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal</ENAMEX> Couple
occasionally turn to an interesting series of collective
nouns that apply to their circumstances?  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX>'s
musings, in her sea of troubles , could go back to her association
with a nayful of knaves , particularly one, one of
an execution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> who have betrayed her confidences.
She has encountered a threatening of courtiers
and an abandonment of confidantes .  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> of a
beribboned bundle of love letters would entertain a company
of gossips and a knot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adversaries</ENAMEX> for ever, much
to the embarrassment of her eloquence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> .

            Outdoors she is harassed by cassettes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographers</ENAMEX>
and a worship of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> , all of whom are employed by a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> .

            At school her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are surrounded by a rascal
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and, on occasions, a flock of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> .  The young
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> have to endure a kissing of aunts and suffer a slew
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncles</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX>'s reflections are of a non-patience of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX>
(both his own and others') and an incredibility of cuck-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">olds</TIMEX> .
He is one of a state of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">princes</ENAMEX> who are shod by a
drunkship of cobblers and clothed by a disguising of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tailors</ENAMEX> .
During his sporting activities he is accompanied by
a stalk of foresters while shooting at a column of wildfowl
or riding with a blast of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">huntsmen</ENAMEX> who are escorted by a
kennel of hounds .  His estates are managed by a provision
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stewards</ENAMEX> .

            At <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> he is surrounded by a farrago of toadies,
a draught of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butlers</ENAMEX> , and a temperance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cooks</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX>'s affairs are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> of a caucus of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>,
a noble <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lords</ENAMEX> , and a bench of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishops</ENAMEX> , all of
whom are kept informed by a diligence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messengers</ENAMEX> .
Finally, he is devoted to his maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendant</ENAMEX> of a dishworship of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scots</ENAMEX> .

            The language of the information superhighway is
Englishâ€”more accurately, a sub-species thereof with its
own grammar and semantics.  Since it has come into being
with a sudden and persistent rush, reflecting the burgeoning
and undisciplined information system it conveys,<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">,</ENAMEX>
it has not been amply recorded, much less described, in
standard reference works or lexicons.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Shorter</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>) and reprinted with
corrections in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same year</TIMEX>, does not even include internet .
To fill the gap, specialized glossaries have emerged,
the best naturally in computerized form (like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Jargon</ENAMEX>
File, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Version 2.9.6</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 August 1991</TIMEX>), where entries
can be quickly and efficiently updated, a process which
in itself reflects the hasty transience of much of the vocabulary.

            Although a complete linguistic description will have
to wait until the dust settlesâ€”if it does at all, given the
volatility of the technology and the ever-increasing number
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>-certain features, destined to
remain, are already apparent.  As far as grammar is concerned,
the simplistic syntax and the exceptional preponderance
of nouns and verbs (with an accompanying
heavy reliance on conversion) are obvious and enduring.
The vocabulary, like the grammar, is determined to a large
extent by the medium of computers and the operation of
networking.  But their insistence on speed is not entirely
the message.  Nor would it be correct simply to draw comparisons
with newspeak or some other centrally decreed
and regulated system.  For although the vocabulary does
make important use of computer terminology, and although
it does share with newspeak a penchant for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blends</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acronyms</ENAMEX> and an avoidance of adjectives and adverbs, it
reflects a manner and an environment greater than both
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">computerese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">newspeak</ENAMEX>.

            Within a strictly controlled computer system, in which
accuracy is absolute, the vocabulary as a whole is programmatically
casual.  Its salient characteristic is its playful
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primitivism</ENAMEX>.  It is laid back: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> talks, chats, browses.
Stress (evident in terms like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">prowler</ENAMEX>, skulker, lurker , as
well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Trojan horse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX>, vulture, leech ) is soothed with
(or disguised by) a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linguistic palliatives</ENAMEX>: generous
helpings from pop culture ( cookie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monster</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kermit</ENAMEX> )
and science fiction ( cyberpunk, core wars, cosmic rays,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emoticon</ENAMEX> ); chummy diminutives ( archie, newbie, smiley );
and jingly rhymes ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snail</ENAMEX> mail ).  The iconic word is surfing:
a sociolinguistic cornucopia of connotations of sport,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vigor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>, individuality, speed, independence, leisure,
health, and middle-to-upper-class education and affluence.
The vocabulary is jocular in its easy mixture of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">casual</ENAMEX> (in slang or coinages or abbreviations), the learned
(in avatar, baroque, catatonic, synchronous ), the visual (in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hieroglyphics</ENAMEX> or emoticons), and even the aural (in the
fondness for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX>, like bang , common spoken name
for !) or onomatopoeia ( bletch, glitch, gonk ).  The vocabulary
is suffisant in its wordplay ( <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A* Infected Disk</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Syndrome</ENAMEX>, sex , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Software EXchange</ENAMEX>) as in the nonchalance
of its central and mixed metaphor: surfing the web ,
borrowed from scanning television <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> for a watchable
program.

            The vocabulary is mischievous in the mixtureâ€”and
not just in the ways just mentioned.  One prominent phenomenon
is the flaunting use of homographs: words that
appear in conventional dictionaries are given a meaning
which is not to be derived logically or figuratively from
the customary <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.  Leaving aside <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blends</ENAMEX> and acronyms,
a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> examples (with definitions from various
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>) should be sufficient:



advent the prototypical compute adventure game.

arc to create a compressed (archive) from a group of
files using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEA ARC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKWare</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PICARC</ENAMEX>, or a
compatible program.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biff</ENAMEX> to notify someone of incoming mail [named after
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">implementor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> barked whenever the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mailman</ENAMEX> came].

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bum</ENAMEX> to make highly efficient, either in time or space,
often at the expense of clarity.

chemist someone who wastes computer time on
number crunching when you'd far rather the
machine were doing something more productive.

flag a piece of information that is either TRUE or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FALSE</ENAMEX>.

flame an ill-considered, insulting e-mail or Usenet
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">retort</ENAMEX>.

jughead an index of high-level gopher menus.

lynx an excellent, text-based, UNIX browser for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pretzel</ENAMEX> command key.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strudel</ENAMEX> common (spoken) name for the circumflex
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>.

tin a threaded newsreader for UNIX.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">troll</ENAMEX> to deliberately post egregiously false information
to a newsgroup in hopes of tricking dense know-it-alls
into correcting you.
            

            It may be argued that such personal semantics are
more than mischievous.  But it would be going too far to
assert that they are critical of existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>.  Jargon
or slang and standard have always coexisted and over the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> have grown more mutually tolerant.  What is clear,
in any case, is that a private and exclusive language is
evolving and engaging ever larger numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
in a linguistic process which is destined to become
more and more public as computer technology itself
becomes the dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> in communication and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> activities.  From the point of view of language, what
is interesting is the coincidence, be it mischievous or critical
or accidental, of the ideal and the real.  For the examples
of semantic noncomplianceâ€”along with features as
widely disparate as computerese or the variety of registersâ€”begin
to reflect a world-view, the crystallization of
a special sphere.  Real , as in realtime <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> the time it takes real
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to communicate, as on a telephone' is set against
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">virtual: 1</ENAMEX>. common alternative to logical.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. simulated;
performing the function of something that isn't really
there.  For netizens , cyberspace is the shared imaginary
reality of the computer networks.  For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>, shared
reality is the existence in space and time of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khyber Pass</ENAMEX>.

         
         
            Atmosphere English



            As a guest in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> household I was drying my hands
on a towel when, glancing down, I noticed some
writing on it.  I think my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> were a little disconcerted
to see me emerging from their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX> laughing roundly
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a couple of minutes</TIMEX> later.  I hastily told them what it said
on the towel: THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUN WAS SHINING AND THE DUDE</ENAMEX>'S
FAMILY WENT ON <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">A PICNIC</ENAMEX>.

            This is an example of what <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> call atmosphere <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, particularly,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> feel that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>-sounding names
and writing on products add prestige to goods marketed
there, and it is certainly true that atmosphere <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> has
reached its apogee.  This has resulted in such products as
a brand of jeans called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Trim Pecker</ENAMEX> , lawn <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fertilizer</ENAMEX> called
Green <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Piles, Cow Brand shampoo, Shot Vision</ENAMEX> TV sets,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carap</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pocky</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pocket Wetty</ENAMEX> pre-moistened
towelettes, and a nail-polish remover called Fingernail
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Remover</ENAMEX> .  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> top <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverages</ENAMEX> are named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calpis</ENAMEX> and Pocari
Sweat , and a coffee <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">creamer</ENAMEX> is called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Creap</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slogans</ENAMEX>, too,
are sometimes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, like this one on a deodorant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">container</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Sweet Medicaâ</ENAMEX>€”it frees you completely from the
smell of your underarm sweat .  Or this, on a bottle of nose
drops: Nazalâ€”for stuffed nose and snot .

            But let us return to for a moment <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sun Was Shining</ENAMEX>
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dude's Family Went on a Picnic</ENAMEX> .  It turned out
this towel had been made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX>.  As is already well
established, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> are the undisputed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> of
putting largely meaningless <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> on their products.
Here, however, was an example of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> efforts in the
same direction and, as a long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> here, I am
pleased to note that it is grammatically irreproachable
and makes some sort of sense!  My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other
towel in the same series which they eagerly dug out; it
read: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">In the Evening the Sheep Was Praying to the Twinkling</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Stars</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dark Sky</ENAMEX> .  I plucked disconsolately at
this towel.  Not at all contemporary, maybe it wasn't the
simple-minded nonsense it seemed, maybe a parody of
Wordsworth perpetrated by a disillusioned towel copy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">writer Ã  la J.K. Stephens</ENAMEX>' celebrated parody of that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>:
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Voices</ENAMEX> are there: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">One</ENAMEX> is of the deep/And one is of
an old <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-witted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>....  But in the end I decided it
was the simple-minded nonsense it seemed.

            I work with many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX>, often outside
office <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>.  So, intrigued by the
Dude towel, I furtively began to case their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>' T-shirts
(all of which, it turned out, had been bought in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>).
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> I came across the following, starting with
the simplest:



<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNOB HOUSE</ENAMEX>

YOUR OWN FEELING

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPP BABY</ENAMEX>

THE <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">EMPLOYMENT OF GOOD SENSE IN CLOTHING</ENAMEX>

THE <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">HAPPINESS OF BEING FASIONALBEâ</ENAMEX>€”A POLICY
OF SELF-DETERMINATION
            

            Here, meaning and grammar cannot be faulted (except
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPP BABY</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAP BABY</ENAMEX> would be intelligible if oddâ€”
lactation, paps, pap pabulum), though, with regard to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clothing</ENAMEX>, few <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> can be said to conform to the
extent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> does.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">salariman</ENAMEX>'s uniform is well known,
and all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolgirls</ENAMEX> must wear blouses modelled
on those of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese mariners</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of sail.  Some
have said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> even conform in rebellion: the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yakuza</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mafia</ENAMEX>) all dress alike though a little
sharper, e.g. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-colour ties, mean pairs of wraparounds,
tattoos, brutal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> cuts, and an attitude!

            Next up on the catwalk is a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> modelling
a truly classic T-shirt:



ALL KINDS OF INSECT WARMING

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BEBE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KIDS FAVOURITE BEBE NAUGHTY CLUB</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLEASE</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> the spelling of favourite â€”the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> is incomprehensible
in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British English</ENAMEX>.

            Rivalling haute insect-warming couture is the last
gem my research turned up, a T-shirt bearing the words:



<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KIDS COMPANY</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KIDS DREAM</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLITHE MATE</ENAMEX>.

THOUGHFUL OF YOU TO DO SO.  I GAIN A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOT OF</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">KNOWLEDGE BY THIS</ENAMEX>.
            

            All these slogans are wrought in attractive designs and lettering
and are not intended to be read, so I would like to
express my thanks to those puzzled <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who
allowed me to do so.  Even so, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native English-speakers</ENAMEX> confronted
with this manner of stuff will have trouble not sniggering
in their sakÃ© andâ€”horror of horrorsâ€”be asked to
explain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wherein</ENAMEX> lies the humour.

            The most important contribution to comparative linguistics
was made by Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Jones</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1746-94</TIMEX>), a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguist</ENAMEX> trained in the law who was appointed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> of the supreme <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> of judicature at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calcutta</ENAMEX>, in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1783</TIMEX>.  Convinced of the importance of consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu</ENAMEX>
legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> in the original [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Encyc</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brit</ENAMEX> . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>,
140a], <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>, well versed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sanskrit</ENAMEX>, became aware of
the correspondences among <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanskrit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Slavic</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germanic</ENAMEX> forms, which led him to the conclusion that
Sanskrit was another, older form of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> language
from which all had sprung.  It was his work that formed
the basis of the linguistic studies later carried on by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brothers Grimm</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jakob Ludwig Karl</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1785-1863</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilhelm</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1786-1859</TIMEX>), which, in turn, gave foundation
to the development of the comparative method.  The term
Indo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> cropped up <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> at the beginning of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th century</TIMEX>; as much of the work was being done in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, it is not surprising that the term preferred
there was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Indo-Germanic</ENAMEX> , actually a translation of indogermanisch
(with a small i because it is an adjective), which
arose in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1820s</TIMEX>; the latter survives in the literature,
largely replaced by the former, especially since the
discovery that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celtic</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.

            The reason for bringing up this bit of history is to introduce
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> terms with which some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> may be unfamiliar
and which reflect to some small degree the poetry
that once lurked in the hearts of linguists educated in literature
as well as linguistics.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is karmadharÄya , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanskrit</ENAMEX> compound of
karma fate, destiny + dharÄya holding, bearing, which
is used to describe a compound word in which the first
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> describes the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, as in highway, blackbird ,
(adj. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+ n.</ENAMEX>), steamboat, bonehead, fingerstall, fingernail,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toenail</ENAMEX> (attrib. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">n. + n.</ENAMEX>).

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is dvandva , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanskrit</ENAMEX> redundant compound
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dva</NUMEX> + dva <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX>, which is used to describe
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compounds</ENAMEX> in which the elements are linked as if joined
by a copula, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prince-consort</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney-general</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">postmaster-general</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">n. + n.</ENAMEX>), bittersweet (adj. + adj.).

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> is bahuvrihi , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanskrit</ENAMEX> compound meaning
having much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>,<bahÃº much=+ vrÄ«hiacute;=rice. It=is
used to describe compounds composed of an adjective and
a substantive so as to form, principally, a possessive adjective,
like bahuvrihi itself; it also forms a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> that
is different grammatically from its head <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> and,
particularly, plurals that function as singular nouns, as in
lazy-bones, sly-boots .  Other examples are rosy-fingered,
redcoat, high-potency (vitamin) , and, indeed, all such
compounds that might be spelled as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words in predicative
position but are usually written with a hyphen
when in attributive position.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> is tatpurusha literally his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servant</ENAMEX>, which
is used to describe compounds in which the first element
qualifies or determines the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, while the second
retains its grammatical independence as a noun, adjective,
or participle.  For example, bookcase, yearbook, summerhouse,
windowbox, eyedoctor; hair-raising,
finger-licking, God-fearing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>-eating; nose-picker,
bottom-feeder, dive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomber</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighter escort</ENAMEX> .

            Whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> is written conventionally as
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words, as a hypheme, or solid has no bearing on its
analysis.  These are not the only possibilities for compounding
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hindi</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanskrit</ENAMEX>), but they are
the most common.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cassell Dictionary of Appropriate</ENAMEX> Adjectives

            It must be emphasized that this is not a synonym
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary; rather</ENAMEX>, it is just what its title denotes: a dictionary
of adjectives that are appropriately connected with
the nouns that are listed.  In a more technical sense, it is
a collection of collocative adjectives, that is, adjectives
that are often associated with the nouns that are listed.
For example, here is the listing under one of the nouns:



appetite, appetites mighty, enormous, gargantuan,
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">endless</TIMEX>, limitless, unlimited, unfailing,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uncontrollable</ENAMEX>, lusty, voracious, ravenous,
(in) satiable, sharp, ferocious, rapacious, devouring,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brutish</ENAMEX>, wolfish, healthy, hearty, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">greedy</ENAMEX>, keen,
robust, inordinate, substantial, unbridled, avaricious,
poor, grotesque, morbid, morose, raucous, finicky,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discriminating,</ENAMEX>, (im) moderate, shrunk, new-found,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catholic</ENAMEX>, postprandial
            

            Not all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjectives</ENAMEX> seem appropriate to me: it is hard
for me to envision a context in which satiable appetite,
raucous appetite, shrunk appetite, or postprandial
appetite might be appropriate; on the other hand, I, like
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, could probably come up with several other
adjectives that are not listed.  Without going into detail on
each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these, the difficulty I see is, for instance, with
raucous appetite , for raucous means harsh, strident, grating
and is commonly associated with voice , where, indeed,
it is listed.  As shrunk is a past and past participle of shrink
and not, properly, an adjective, I am not sure why it is there
in place of shrunken , especially since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail</ENAMEX> specifically
writes in his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Preface</ENAMEX>, Only words listed in standard language
dictionaries as adjectives are included in this <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>.
Thus all other etymological forms, as participles
ending in - <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ed</ENAMEX> (rejected offer) or - ing (playing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>), are
excluded.  As for postprandial , that is usually applied to
something edible or drinkable, as referring to something
that comes after a meal; in my <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> (and culture), postprandial
appetite would be a rare collocution.

            Everyone has his own private view of how language
works, an observation seldom offered by linguists, even
those who touch on the subject of idiolect.  That this book
is highly personal becomes evident in the entry immediately
following that for appetite:

               
appetizer, appetizers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">See</ENAMEX> also food intriguing, exquisite,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">irresistible</ENAMEX>, tasty, cheesy, spicy, tangy
            

            Here, one might yearn for some punctuation: surely
the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> words cannot be considered alongside the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>.  Moreover, I can think of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of other words
in the tasty, tangy class that could be added, but those
appear in the very long entry under <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> .

            In principle, I like the idea of such a book and have
thought about doing one myself.  But the almost insurmountable
practical considerations reared up before me,
and I quickly abandoned the idea.  For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing, entries
become less useful the longer they are.  In the present work,
for example, the entry for appetite runs to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> lines,
which is reasonably assimilable; the entry for approach,
approaches, however, runs to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> lines, life, lives
to fifty-eight, eye, eyes to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sixty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>.  Are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> really so
desperate for descriptive adjectives that will go with nouns
as to be willing to wade through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost two hundred</TIMEX>
terms?  I rather doubt it.  Then there is the question, Why
are both singular and plural forms shown for the headwords?
Although mention is made of the fact in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preface</ENAMEX>,
no reason is given, and one might assume that users
of such a book would have no difficulty in assuming that
the plural of breadwinner is breadwinners , even that the
singular of teeth is tooth .

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> criticism of this book, in particular, is that the
adjectives are jumbled together in no discernible order
or, as mentioned, with punctuation between (except for a
serial comma).  Thus under architecture, we find strings like



...(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">un</ENAMEX>)original, eccentric, plain, austere, mediocre,
nondescript...

...civic, religious, pastel, mosaic, landscape,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prehistoric</ENAMEX>...
            

            and it is not till we get to the end, where a dozen styles
are listed that there is any sense of semantic or associative
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grouping</ENAMEX>.  This shortcoming can be seen in most
entries:



area, areas...affluent, rich, unique, crucial, key,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prime</ENAMEX>, vital, sensitive, volatile, enjoyable, quiet...

artefact, artefacts [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX>]...impressive, authentic...
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">priceless</ENAMEX>, deathless...aboriginal, religious, cultural
eye, eyes...bluish, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">china-</ENAMEX>) blue, sea-blue, brunet,
almond, (liquid-) brown, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ginger</ENAMEX>-brown...
            

            From the spelling ( artefact, honour ) and from the name
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>, this is clearly a work produced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>.
Although there might be some differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX>, one is sore put to accept their
extending to the notion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British English</ENAMEX>
regard almond as a color for eyes rather than a shape.

            This collection could have been made more useful
and more usable had the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> attempted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> adjectives
within an entry according to semantic character
rather than just dump them into one helter-skelter list without
separators of any kind.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manual of Specialised Lexicography</ENAMEX>: The Preparation
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specialised</ENAMEX> Dictionaries
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the decades</TIMEX> during which I have been involved in
the compilation, editing, revision, updating, adaptation,
etc. of dictionaries, I have always considered lexicography
an art.  That is not to say that technique is not involved,
merely to observe that some dictionaries are better than
others because their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> are more literate, imaginative,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">poetic</ENAMEX>, and generally possess those attributes with
which we associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art</ENAMEX> rather than technique or mundane
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">craftsmanship</ENAMEX>.  Such dictionaries, too, succeed because
they establish a rapport with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>.  It goes
without saying that most of those drawn to lexicography,
like those attracted to art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, exhibit skills more likely
to be associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> than with art; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>, far
too few of those who work on dictionaries have a thorough
grounding in literature, let alone the various specialties
within linguisticsâ€”general and comparative studies,
classical and modern foreign language study, phonetics,
philology, etymology, to say nothing of lexicology and lexicography.
The results are seen on the bookshelves of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bookshops</ENAMEX> throughout the world: adequate but largely
pedestrian bilingual dictionaries and a scattering of monolingual
works that have been resurrected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">greedy publishers</ENAMEX>
who have engaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dryasdust editors</ENAMEX> to update
out-dated, out-of-copyright dictionaries in order to make
a fast buck.

            Lexicographic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technocrats</ENAMEX> enjoy using terms like terminology,
terminography, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSP</ENAMEX> language for special purposes,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGP</ENAMEX> language for general purposes, lemma,
lexeme , and other words, reflecting the notion, long prevalent
in psychology, sociology, and other social sciences, that
if you can give a problem a name, you have somehow
gone a long way toward solving it.  This book, which consists
of a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> and subchapters, was written
by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>, which immediately tells the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> something
about its likely consistency and continuity.

            It is true that the principles that apply to specialized
dictionaries are not the same as those that apply to general
dictionaries, either monolingual or bilingual.  For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
thing, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> of a specialized dictionary can be assumed
to have a level of sophistication that includes knowledge
of and some understanding of what goes on in general dictionaries.
It takes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of the subject book several
pages to make this point, which, it seems to me, is rather
simple.  Their explanation includes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Venn diagrams</NUMEX> (which,
notwithstanding their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>, I thought had gone out of
fashion <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few decades ago</TIMEX>) and other devices.  It is hard
to imagine that this book would be picked up by anyone
but a lexicographer or someone interested enough in
becoming <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to subject himself to such a turgid presentation;
in the event, one might assume a certain level
of familiarity with the subject.  Yet the treatment is reminiscent
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Irving</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Knickerbocker History of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , whichâ€”facetiously, at leastâ€”starts out with the
creation of the world.  If one doubts the turgidity of the
style of this work, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> the following, which merely says
that entries in a dictionary can be ordered in different ways:



The macrostructure of the word list should be
understood as the arrangement of the lemmata
occurring in the word list.
            

            Is that the writing of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to whom you would want
to give the responsibility for explaining complex or
unknown terms in simple language?  A few sentences farther
on, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> offers:



Knowledge of the alphabet implies that lemmata
may easily be arranged and looked up.
            

            I think I have dwelt on such shortcomings enough.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Writing Systems</ENAMEX>

            This is truly an impressive-looking tome, persuading
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that it is complete and authoritative.  As for completeness,
writing systems are a bit off my beaten track,
and I dare not offer an opinion; as for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peter</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. Daniels</ENAMEX>' name is not familiar to me, the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bright</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emeritus</ENAMEX> of linguistics at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCLA</ENAMEX> and erstwhile
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> (for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-two years</TIMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Language</ENAMEX> , the journal
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linguistics Society of America</ENAMEX>, is well known
to me, chiefly in his latter capacity.  In a preceding number
of VERBATIM [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>], appeared a review article by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Brashear</ENAMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>,
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new books dealing with the alphabet; now we have
this comprehensive work on writing systems.

            Interest in writing systems was dormant for many
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some thirty years ago</TIMEX>, the onlyâ€”and best-knownâ€”
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> working with alphabets was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Diringer</ENAMEX>.
The spark that has ignited so many to look at the subject
is difficult to identify: perhaps it can be put down to television
and its many programs dealing with archaeology.  A
recent program on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Minoan</ENAMEX> civilization mentioned
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Ventris</ENAMEX> was a teenager when he listened to
a lecture by Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Evans</ENAMEX> in which he described his
struggles trying to translate what had become known as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> B, the ancient scripts found at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knossos</ENAMEX>
and elsewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>.  Ventris, the program held,
vowed to be the one who would <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> translate the
script(s), a reflex of ambition rarely associated with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">teenagers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.  In any event, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ventris</ENAMEX> did, finally, decode
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear B</ENAMEX>, but died (at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thirty-four</NUMEX>) before arriving at a
translation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear A.</ENAMEX>  If susceptible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX> watched
that program, perhaps they will be inspired to work on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear A</ENAMEX>, still an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enigma</ENAMEX>, owing largely to the paucity of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corpus</ENAMEX>.

            The subject of writing systems was considered beyond
the pale by structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguists</ENAMEX>, as it was not a reflex of
natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">utterance</ENAMEX> but a secondary representation.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Structural</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguists</ENAMEX> do not like to deal with meaning, either, satisfied
that the meaning of a word is the sum of its
contextsâ€”a perfectly valid argument if one allows context
to include one's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> telling an infant, Here, darling,
eat another spoon of applesauce.  Unless ostensive
objects are thus pointed to and identified, how could anyone
ever learn their names?)  As a consequence, the subject
was infra dig for serious linguists for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>,
and it is refreshing to see it brought to the surface again.
The impact of writing on language cannot be denied: in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, the conservatism of the spelling system has had
an effect on the preservation of linguistic features that
might have otherwise faded; in all languages, the traditions
of literature (to say nothing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">scripture</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX>] ) have
a profound influence, as the fundamentalist effect bears
witness.  To ignore or scorn writing and its influences is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">struthious</ENAMEX> and unscholarly, and this emerging crop of
books, besides their attractive graphicsâ€”excuse the punâ€”
are welcome.

            The relationships between linguistics and writing are
emphasized here and there in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The World's Writing Systems</ENAMEX>
by the short essays, prepared by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX>,
that punctuate the text.  It would be most useful
to provide a list of the thirteen parts of the book:



Part I      Grammatology

            Systems
Part III    Decipherment

Part <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XII    Secondary Notation Systems</ENAMEX>
Part XIII   imprinting and Printing
            

            Each of these parts, introduced by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contributor</ENAMEX> or
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>, has several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>; there are seventyfour
sections in all, and each of those, in turn, has its own
commentary.  The result is not only a comprehensive treatment
of a subject by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> but a detailed description
of the place the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX> has in the general scheme of
representing ideas by squiggles on a page, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX>, or tablet.
Not only are (so-called) standard writing systems described,
but (under Part XII) there are sections on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Numerical</ENAMEX>
Notation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shorthand</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phonetic Notation, Music Notation</ENAMEX>
(by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James D. McCawley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago</ENAMEX>), and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Movement Notation Systems</ENAMEX> (dealing with dance).  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section Adaptations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic Script</ENAMEX> was prepared by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. Kaye</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California State University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fullerton</ENAMEX>), erstwhile

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>) contributed the subsection on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welsh, in Part X.</ENAMEX>

            The word colophon has undergone several metamorphoses
since its earliest appearance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>:
it originally referred to the inscription at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of</TIMEX>
a book identifying its basic bibliographic information, that
is, title, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, subject, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">date</TIMEX> and place of publication,
in other words, the information <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> found on
the title page.  Presumably, because it sounded like a fancy
bibliographic term, it was adapted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX> as
a fancy word for logotype , or trade mark .  For its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> incarnation
we can cite page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">920</NUMEX> of the present book in which
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colophon</ENAMEX> is drawn into service as the title of a section that
lists all the typographic fonts employed in typesetting the
book.  That is a useful and interesting adjunct, and we
must assume that it has been called colophon because
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">typography</ENAMEX> has been subsumed under the original rubric
of bibliographic information.  Although it is not documented
in any dictionary that I checked, this usage is
familiar to me as referring to the modest comments that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alfred A. Knopf</ENAMEX> once included on the last
page of their books, for example (actually from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> title):

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Writing Systems</ENAMEX> is an essential addition
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> of anyone interested in or involved in any
of the myriad aspects of language, both as a fascinating
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">browsing</ENAMEX> book and as an important reference work.  I have
no immediate need for information about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinhalese</ENAMEX>, for
instance, but who knows what sorts of questions may arise
in my mind (or others') that might send me rushing to the
shelf?  My only disappointment was that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniels</ENAMEX>' concluding
essays on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analog</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital Writing</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 74</ENAMEX>)
were not sufficiently detailed and technical for my taste,
but then my appetite for matters technical probably
exceeds that of most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> likely to be concerned with
writing systems.

            Phoneticians, pronunciation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of dictionaries,
linguists, language <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, and others who areâ€”and
ought to beâ€”interested in and knowledgeable about the
sounds of many languages and who haveâ€”and ought to
haveâ€”sufficient background and training to understand
the technical materials on which understanding of the
text relies will be amply rewarded by this valuable book.
The writing is concise and specific, allowing little room
for idle chatter; the information is sometimes revelatory:



<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Nearly 90 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>
produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> as in think...with the tip of the tongue
protruded between the teeth so that the turbulence is
produced between the blade of the tongue and the
upper incisors.  <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 10 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>
made this sound in this way; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> of them used
an articulation with the tip of the tongue behind the
upper front teeth.  [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p. 143</ENAMEX>]
            

            One is moved to enquire how the sound is articulated by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> dialects or in other regions
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX>, for example), but the book does not go
into that much detail.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is by sound types: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stops</ENAMEX>, Nasals

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Rose</ENAMEX> writes a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> column about language
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Canberra Times</ENAMEX> , and this book is a collection of
those essays, fleshed out in full in those instances where
they might have been cut by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> for economy
of space.  The essays are brief and interesting and range
throughout the entire spectrum of the subject, including
literature.  There is, for example, a piece on spoofs in
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX> cites several that are well known, omits others
(like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poe</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">The Great Balloon Hoax</ENAMEX>), and includes
at least one that is a satire, which is a different sort of animal:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulliver's Travels</ENAMEX> is not, to my mind, a spoof.  I am
all in favor of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> columns on language, but one must
be careful.

            Rose is now seventy-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> and, evidently, going strong.
The book is informative and entertaining, but the reader
should check the validity of some of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX>'s comments
before incorporating it into a doctoral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissertation</ENAMEX> or other
important work.  That admonition applies also to the blurb
on the back cover, which, presumably, was composed by
somebody at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kangaroo Press</ENAMEX> but not submitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rose</ENAMEX>
for approval.  It refers to His vulgar vocabulary and facility
in slang, butâ€”more importantâ€”it offers oddities like
a reference to learning by rote on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX> and to Pidgin
on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>: upon looking both up, I found nothing
about rote learning on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX> and nothing about Pidgin
on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>; nor was either listed in the sparse index.
The cover copy also refers to his endlessly entertaining
analyses of literary terms such hypocorism [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">palindrome</ENAMEX>,
clerihew, idiom, [and] acronym: of these, acronym
and hypocorism are as absent from the index as the as
between such and hypocorism.  Perhaps such curiosities
will make the book a collector's item, but whoever
wrote the text for it at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kangaroo</ENAMEX> ought to be relegated
to the outback.

            I am prejudiced, I know, but while I find the use of
impact as a verb an interesting linguistic development, I
consider it execrable style for literate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> and (especially)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>; yet it appears in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preface</ENAMEX>, where one
can also find a transitive use for coruscate ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OED2e</ENAMEX> please
note).  It is not <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">de rigueur</TIMEX> for linguists or lexicographers
to utter judgments about language, just as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> are not
supposed to react with revulsion should a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> reveal
a particularly revolting affliction.  But it seems to me (occasionallyâ€”like
now) that it is just such prejudices that I
am being paid to express.  Otherwise, why bother reading
a review?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Davidson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Philosophy of Language</ENAMEX>

            From the cover: The guiding intuition is that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davidson</ENAMEX>'s work is best understood as an ongoing attempt
to purge semantics of theoretical reifications.  Seen in this
light the recent attack on the notion of language itself
emerges as a natural development of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quinian</ENAMEX> scepticism
towards meanings and his rejection of referencebased
semantic theories.
         
         
            Statistics in Dialectology
            From the cover: [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">P</ENAMEX>]rovides a clear, easily understood
course in statistics for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguist</ENAMEX> who works with real
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linguistic</ENAMEX> data from real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and converts those finding
into numbers.
         
         
            Bilingualism
            From the cover: This book is a general introduction
to the study of bilingualism from a combined
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sociolinguistic</ENAMEX> and psycholinguistic perspective....
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romaine</ENAMEX> explores bilingualism as both a societal
and cognitive phenomenon....  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> also
assesses the positive and negative claims made for the
effects of bilingualism on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s cognitive, social and
academic development, and examines the assumptions
behind various language policies and programs for bilingual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Autosegmental & Metrical Phonology</ENAMEX>
            From the cover: This is the first complete introduction
to the current generative theoretical phonology,
presenting a general introduction to the two theories of
phonological representation that lie at the center of current
research.  In addition, the central issues and tenets
of lexical phonology are set out and critically evaluated.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gender Voices</ENAMEX>
            From the cover: Does the language we speak create
and sustain a sexist culture?...  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>...explore
...the idea that language shapes individual livesâ€”that
through our speech we all help recreate gender divisions
in society.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sociolinguistics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Language Acquisition</ENAMEX>
            From the cover: In this book, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston</ENAMEX>
assesses the relationship between second <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> acquisition
and sociolinguistics, focusing in particular on the
findings of quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociolinguists</ENAMEX>.
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethnography of Communication</ENAMEX>, An Introduction
            From the cover: [This book] is concerned with how
and why language is used and how its use varies in different
cultures....  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saville-Troike</ENAMEX> presents the essential
terms and concepts introduced and developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dell</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hymes</ENAMEX> and others and surveys the most important findings
and applications of their work.  Drawing on insights
from social anthropology and psycholinguistics and using
examples from a great many languages and cultures, she
builds up a model which includes communications within
the overall framework of cultural competence.
         
         
            An Introduction to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Phonetics &</ENAMEX> Phonology
            From the cover: Assuming no prior knowledge of
the subject, this book offers a thorough account of topics
covered in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> in phonetics and phonology.
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford English Grammar</ENAMEX>
            Undertaking a description of a language may be
regarded as a curious occupation.  Writing reviews of them
is no less odd an experience.  For various reasons, I have
chosen to comment on only certain aspects of this book,
chiefly because a thorough review would occupy far more
space in VERBATIM than many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> might willingly tolerate.
Suffice it to say that the grammar is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chomskyan</ENAMEX> and,
though a bit thin on the ground, is quite adequate.  I have
found other things to criticize, however, that may be more
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">germane</ENAMEX> to books in general, especially reference books
and, particularly, to reference books on language.

            First, I want to vent my spleen on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>' book
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> who haven't the slightest idea of what they are
doing.  As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case in point, I cite The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Edition</ENAMEX> , in which,
possibly in order to mimic other dictionaries but probably
because there are few things that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> can get their
grubby little fingers into, the main entry words were reset
in sans-serif type, presumably just to make them harder to
read.  Those who are not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> but typographers
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">steeped</ENAMEX> in statistics of readability and other scientific applications
to typography are fully aware that because of the
redundancy built into its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, almost any serif font
is more (readily) legible than any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sans-serif</ENAMEX> face, and trying
to make a book look modern by using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sans-serif</ENAMEX> makes
no sense at all.  Besides, there is nothing modern about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sans</ENAMEX>-serif type: if anything, it is moderne â€”that is, in the
tradition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Deco</ENAMEX>.  Turning to the illustrations (including
the black-and-white maps) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the RHD2e</TIMEX> , it must be
said that the originals were a model of clarity and detail:
I know, for as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managing Editor</ENAMEX>, it was among my responsibilities
to commission them and to accept or reject completed
artwork or to have it modified.  That was a laborious
and time-consuming task, amply rewarded by the high
quality of the drawings as published in the original edition.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Edition</ENAMEX> , however, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> took it upon
themselvesâ€”merely for the sake of change, I believeâ€”to
lay a fine screen over every illustration (except the maps),
thus losing much of the finical detail originally produced.
The result is a dull, grayish blob on the page.

            As if to confirm that the various afflictions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX>
have infected the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> operations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford University</ENAMEX>
Press, we are now faced with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenbaum's Grammar</ENAMEX> ,
which can only be said to have suffered.  Worse, their
incredibly unimaginative work has resulted in a book that
ought to have been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 400</NUMEX> pages shorter than the present
work, which I shall explain.

            In his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Preface</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenbaum</ENAMEX> suggests that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grammar</ENAMEX> can be used as a work of reference.  The
structure of the bookâ€”through no fault of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s,
I am sureâ€”militates against such use, for the Index refers
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to numbered sections: each chapter is numbered
from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1</NUMEX> (The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX>) through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spelling</ENAMEX>), with
subsections numbered sequentially (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> Internationally
through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good English</ENAMEX>).  A typical question
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> faces is a choice between may and might , so I
looked up might in the Index and found


might <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.25</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.29</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.17</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
            

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> problem, inherent in the poor design of the
book, is that there is no clue in the running <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> as to
which chapter and section one has turned to (unless he
has chanced on the beginning of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> or section:
only the page number appears).  The section titles and numbers
frequently appear at the gutter column, making it
almost impossible to thumb through the book to find a
reference quickly.  As it happens, both the title of subsections
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.25</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.29</NUMEX> happen to be in the gutters of
the pages where they begin, making it inconvenient to find
them.  Had these numerals been set at the foredge of the
pages (instead of the page numbers, which serve no discernible
useful purpose), finding the proper chapter and
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">subsection</ENAMEX> numbers would have been greatly facilitated.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> problem is the (unexplained) style <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>,
which should properly be designated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.24</NUMEX>: there are
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX>, so it is confusing to see a reference,
apparently to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, that is really a reference to a subsection.
(Under the Index entry for dictionaries are
listed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.28</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 8</ENAMEX> contains no subsections
beyond <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.21</NUMEX>, clearly a mistake.)

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, excluding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Glossary</ENAMEX>, the
book contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 600</NUMEX> pages, and, presumably to bulk
up its page count (probably at the instigation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>,
so that more money could be charged for it), the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">designer</ENAMEX> has employed a hanging indention of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about ten</NUMEX>
picas, and wide interlinear spaces.  The result, had the
book been set to full measure, is that it would have been
less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> pages long.

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, relating specifically to the entries looked up,
while may and might are both mentioned, except for the
following passing remark [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p. 154</ENAMEX>] no comment appears:



<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.  Their past forms are often used to refer to present
or future time:

He might be there now.

She could drive my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>.
            

            That is not inaccurate, but it scarcely tells the full story,
nor is it particularly helpful in explaining the use of may ,
which is the present of which might is the past, in constructions
like She may have said that vs.  She might have
said that .  There is no internal cross reference to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.24</NUMEX> B,
where the notions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Permission</ENAMEX> and Possibility are given
peremptory coverage (though there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> citations), and
no helpful comment is offered about their interchangeability
in contemporary usage or what was, formerly, their
distinction in formal contexts.

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fifth</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glossary</ENAMEX> (pp. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">615-35</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> itself largely
with the terminology of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chomskyan</ENAMEX> grammar, but the
treatment is unsatisfactory.  For instance,



rhotic accent Non-rhotic accents drop the /r/ when it
is followed by a consonant sound, as in part.

They also drop the /r/ at the end of a word when it
comes before a pause.  Rhotic accents retain the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/r/.</ENAMEX>
            

            It is poor style to find the headword term defined virtually
as an afterthought.  The entry at mass noun is a cross
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reference</ENAMEX>, See count noun.; but the definition at count
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noun</ENAMEX> makes no mention of mass noun .  Although the definition
for common noun consists of a cross reference to
proper noun , there is no proper definition for it at proper
noun , only a contrastive comment from which one is supposed
to derive a definition by default.  As only Chomskyan
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grammar</ENAMEX> is covered in the book, entries are lacking for
such common grammatical conceptsâ€”albeit from other
disciplines, like traditional grammarâ€” substantive,
dependent clause, independent clause, conjunctive adverb,
adverbial conjunction, misplaced (or dangling) modifier ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.â€”all</ENAMEX> terms well established in discussions of nonChomskyan
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grammar</ENAMEX>.  Many of the definitions use terms
that are not themselves defined and are not always transparently
clear, e.g., postmodify, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linguistic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> , etc.

            Some of these shortcomings can be laid at the door
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, some at the door of the book <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX>, most
in the lap of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> (if there was one).

            It is undeniable that the word-stock of a language can
be derived from a vast corpus of its writing and speech
to produce a dictionary; a grammar can be likewise derived,
but such exercises are rare and are usually confined to work
on dead languages.  Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champollion</ENAMEX> had little enough
to go on to decipher the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosetta Stone</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ventris</ENAMEX> would
have been hard put to find a native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> of Minoan
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> B (or A).  But for modern languages, the situation
is different.  Preparing a monolingual <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">English dictionary</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lexicographers</ENAMEX> who are native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> may often
turn to citations of usage in context to derive or verify senses
of some words; but for words whose meanings they already
know, they can rely on their own knowledge and use citations
for confirmation.  Relying solely on one's own knowledge
can be dangerousâ€”witness <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s definition of
pastern â€”so one must always check and double-check;
but that is not a difficult matter if citation material is
available, and there are usually other books or specialists
one can consult.

            (Let me say parenthetically that not only is there
nothing wrong with looking at others' work but that those
who studiously avoid doing so for any reason are extremely
foolish: how can one know how the competition has handled
something without checking?  Aside from the
unavoidable fact that competition is a driving force in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> of such works, one can scarcely expect
to improve on the competitive works without knowing
what they are up to.)

            Writing a grammar entails many judgements, but the
most relevant for my purposes here is to wonder about
the amount of information brought to the task by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grammarian</ENAMEX>.  It is highly unlikely that the subject will be
approached with a feigned tabula rasa , relying solely on
citation materials.  But the question arises whether the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grammar</ENAMEX> is constructed from what is known (or found)
and then verified through the application of suitable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">citations</ENAMEX>, whether the grammar is citation-driven, or
a combination of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> is employed.  In any event,
the requirement for an experienced grammarian is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undiminished</ENAMEX>.

            In principle, one must question the function of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grammar</ENAMEX>.  In essence, such a work cannot be more or less
than a description of how a language works.  But the question
must arise in the mind of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> (if not the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grammarian</ENAMEX>), Who is going to use the book?  That is not
readily answered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>.  There was a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
were required to study the grammar of the language,
but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX> appears to be gone.  Today, then, we
might more logically be looking at a market consisting of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who want a reference grammar, that is, one in
which they can find answers to their questions about how
the language works.

            This raises a question germane to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grammar</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenbaum</ENAMEX> has drawn on the
huge resources of a number of different corpora of English
that have been gathered at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Survey</ENAMEX> of English
Usage and several other research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, all of which
are listed in an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Appendix</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pp</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">601-14</ENAMEX>].  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of the
citations range widely and include telephone conversations,
classroom lessons, broadcast interviews, parliamentary
debates, spontaneous commentaries, business transactions,
news broadcasts, etc.  One could scarcely disagree
with the fact that all of these make up a reasonable crosssection
of what must be categorized as the popular use
of language.  Throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grammar</ENAMEX> are interspersed
quotations from these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, each carefully documented.

            That might well provide a reasonably accurate picture
of contemporary language.  But is that what a user of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grammar</ENAMEX> as a reference grammar might want?  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">beauties of the Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX> (and of, say, A
Grammar of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George O. Curme</ENAMEX>)
is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> are comforted by quotations from sources
that are acknowledged paragons of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> usage, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>
like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX>, etc., even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX>.
Are they likely to be attracted by evidence from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>' conversations with their flatmates?  from recordings
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>-dinner family conversations?  I could
find <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only twenty</TIMEX> books that had been mined for citations
and all were published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>.  (I hasten to say that
although the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curme Grammar</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">VERBATIM Book</ENAMEX>, my
purpose in bringing it up is not to sell books but to contrast
its content with that of the subject Grammar .)

            There is still another aspect to the whole business of
citations.  Some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years ago</TIMEX>, I proposed that the most
relevantly useful attribute of citations was their exposure ,
that is, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who, on the basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readership</ENAMEX>
statistics, could be assumed to be reading and
listening to the manifestations of language presented in
books, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>, and radio and television
broadcasts [ Word , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXVI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>: An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unabridged Word Count</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>].  The exposure of a word would be expressed
as an index number resulting from the normalization of
(unwieldily large) numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX> and
would be likely to provide some meaningful measure of
the frequency for a significantly large percentage of the
lexicon.  Prior to that, frequencies had been calculated on
the basis of raw occurrences in a text selected by a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> at whim, though it must be acknowledged that
the books (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least</NUMEX>) selected for examination were classics
of literature assumed to be widely read, taught, and
used as models of effective expression (if one insists on
avoiding the concept of good <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>).

            In resorting to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> that might be justifiably viewed
as natural language, those who concur with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Professor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenbaum</ENAMEX>'s approach ignore this important aspect of
citational matter.  I am not sure that anyone has attempted
their documentation, but it is well known that an enormous
number of clichÃ©s, idioms, metaphors, and other
expressions used in everyday contemporary speech and
writing derive from the writings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> and other
contributors to the imagery and poetry of the language.
While their manifestations undoubtedly appear in the
snatches of telephone and flatmate conversations recorded
in the numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corpora</ENAMEX> cited in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grammar</ENAMEX> , their exposure is virtually asymptotic to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>.
In other words, there are some who believe that we might
be well advised to attend to what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Donne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dryden</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jefferson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franklin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byron</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Keats</ENAMEX>,
Austen, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alcott</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of others have
contributed to the molding of the language in all its reflexes
and who find it difficult to understand the usefulness to
be derived from an analysis of idle telephone and flatmate
conversations, student essays read by no one other than
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> charged with their marking, business letters
read by no one other than their (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>,
non-printed examination scripts exposed to nobody,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> letters, classroom lessons, business transactions
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between</NUMEX>, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">solicitor</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX>), and so on.  While it is undeniable that
some of the sourcesâ€”news broadcasts, broadcast talks,
press news reports, for instanceâ€”can be said to reach a
relatively wide (though unquantified) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readership</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>,
they are in the minority compared with the large
number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> that seem to reflect language that
occurs, as they say these days, on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-on-one</NUMEX> basis.

            Is that lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> material what people
want or expect from a grammar?  Not I, to be sure.  Given
a choice, I should prefer to model my language on the
writings of acknowledged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> and on the speech of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roosevelts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Churchills</ENAMEX> rather than on what appears in
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> essay.  I can make a clinical observation regarding
the diminution of politeness in the language, attributable,
perhaps, to the lowering of the standards of civility
and yielding, typically, constructions <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">like Me</ENAMEX> and her went
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> (as contrasted with Her and me went to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">park</ENAMEX>, I suppose).

            I was unable to find any comment by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> justifying
the use and application of the (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX>-word <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Corpus</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICE-GB</ENAMEX>).

            Also, comments regarding standard and nonstandard
usage are absent.  For example, nothing is offered regarding
the poor style of the reflexive pronouns for I or me as
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> had obviously been very carefully planned
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> and myself in mind [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p. 183</ENAMEX>], though why and
is italicized in the original is hard to understand.  It may
be argued that in a descriptive grammarâ€”how can a grammar
be anything but descriptive?  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€”comment</ENAMEX> about good
and bad <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> are anathema, but weasily little comments
can be inserted (as they are in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dictionary</ENAMEX> usage notes)
referring to careful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>, educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">peers</ENAMEX>, and others whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of a grammar might, conceivable,
wish to emulate.  Thus, rare is the dictionary that
offers infer as a synonym for imply without some sort of
label.  Even the permissive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merriam-Webster III</ENAMEX> , while
remaining tight-lipped about usage, condescends to offer
see IMPLY at definition <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> of infer .  As those who use infer
for imply might be somehow stigmatized in (some) educated
circles, failure to report such a usage leaves the
suspicious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> of a dictionary (or grammar) who has the
wit to look it up facing a serious lacuna in the information
given about the language.  Such information is not prescriptive
or proscriptive, it is descriptive of certain
attitudesâ€”right or wrongâ€”about the language and has
its proper place in a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>.  Comparable grammatical
usages merit mention and appropriate comment.

            In a subsection called <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Good English</ENAMEX> Greenbaum
makes a passing reference to the aesthetic use of language
[<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.10</NUMEX>]; but remarks concerning artistic use of language
are notably absent, presumably lest they constitute
some sort of value judgment.  As we all know, the grammar
has been distorted by political correctness (e.g., in
avoiding the masculine pronoun as a pronoun of reference),
and, in a rare opinion, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> concedes that constructions
like A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Candidate</ENAMEX> who wishes to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School</ENAMEX>
before his or her eighteenth birthday may be asked to
write to state his or her reasons can be clumsy.

            The basic question is, To what use can such a book
be put?  There can be no confuting the fact that the grammar
of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Englishâ</ENAMEX>€”that is, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> in use for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two centuriesâ</TIMEX>€”differs little from that of earlier
stages of the language: after all, languages are sorted and
distinguished by linguists on the basis of their grammars,
not their lexicons.  (Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Germanic</ENAMEX> language
because of the history of its structure, or grammar; were
its lexicon alone to be considered, it might well be classified
as a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Romance language</ENAMEX>, owing to the large percentage
of words of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> origin.)  There is
no gainsaying the advantages in having an up-to-date
grammar of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  Though, personally, I am not enamored
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chomskyan</ENAMEX> grammar, despite its occasional departures
from traditional terminology, nouns and adjectives
are still nouns and adjectives.  The chief aim remains a thorough,
consistent, coherent, preferably understandable
description of the structure of a language.  Indeed, some
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenbaum</ENAMEX>'s presentation amounts to a tacit commentary
on and reflects valid criticism of the inconsistencies
found in traditional grammar.  Unfortunately, the commentary,
being tacit, is a bit too subtle for many of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are likely to refer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grammar</ENAMEX> .

            [It is with the deepest regret that we announce the
sudden death, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 May 1996</TIMEX>, of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend Professor</ENAMEX>
Greenbaum, while on a speaking engagement in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>.]

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Urdang</ENAMEX>
         
         
            The F Word
            At first, the idea that there can be a single word in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> or in any language that merits the creation of a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">232</NUMEX>-page volumeâ€”directory, rather than dictionaryâ€”
devoted to it exclusively must seem preposterous.  But
with the initial riffle through the pages of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">The F Word</ENAMEX>,
noting the different typefaces that designate parts of
speech, definition, date of origin, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, examples, it
becomes evident that this word is the great workhorse,
an old familiar in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Life</ENAMEX>, and indeed deserving.

            
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F Word</ENAMEX> , the work of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar etymologist</ENAMEX> who
is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident editor</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictionary department</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, proves to be a rare item indeed: a comprehensive,
vastly eclectic, tongue-in-cheek serious treatment
that has to be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and last word on this world-class
Word.  For the curious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">layperson</ENAMEX>, it will be a source of
amazement and information, a good deal of it funny,
including many of the anecdote-examples, but some of it
revealing and far from funny.  Funny are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">ingenious hybrids</ENAMEX>,
elaborate euphemisms and novel insult-categories.  Not
funny, I think, are numbers of sex-related terms referring
to actions or practices more traditionally the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> of
reports by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychiatrists</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, and, increasingly,
stories in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>.  That some of the terms, like
the practices, are nearly as old as printing cuts or ought
to cut the ground out from under those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> who
attribute it all to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '60s'</TIMEX> and post-'60s' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>.

            It takes no more than a preliminary skim to suspect
what is soon substantiated in the ample <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and usages
that accompany most entriesâ€”that it is within the military
services of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Great Britain</ENAMEX>, from
the times of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">World Wars</ENAMEX>, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>words have their
truest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>.  Why this is so might provoke some thought.
Is it a kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks clannishness</ENAMEX>?  Certainly it is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">macho</ENAMEX>, masculine kind of thing, with more than a touch
of adolescent snobbery in one's familiarity with a special
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">treasure</ENAMEX>, such as snafu or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.F.D.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">q.</ENAMEX>v. for yourself).

            An instance comes to mind from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941-1946</TIMEX> years
lived in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">infantry division</ENAMEX>.  Crossing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Atlantic</ENAMEX>
in late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX>, one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> of us packed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX> made
for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> read aloud a joke in a letter from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>: A Scotsman
(jokes were openly ethnic then) on discovering his
near-drowned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> being resuscitated yells at the exhausted
rescuer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Well</ENAMEX> and good, mon, but where in 'ell is his
hat?  Overnight it became a staple for expressing ingratitude,
greed or pushiness, properly adapted of course:
Say yr <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chow</ENAMEX>'s not hot enough?  Where's 'is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fxxxin</ENAMEX>' hat, hey?
And there were a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">outfits â€”companies</ENAMEX>, battalions,
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regimentâ€”that</ENAMEX> claimed snafu
was coined solely in-house, to the point that the division
newspaper once actually tried to authenticate the origin,
precipitating a near riot.

            Curious among the many curiosities in this entertaining
work: the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> coinage snafu gets only
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two and a half</NUMEX> pages.  The word or term commanding the
second greatest coverage is an unspeakable that is evidently
spoken a great deal.  Including all its usages, initials, purposeful
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distortions</ENAMEX>, etc., it fills pages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">191 to 214</TIMEX>.  I, at
least, would never have suspected!

            This book will probably find no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> fully conversant
beforehand with even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> its contents.  Who knows
the distinction between a fxxxface and a fxxxhead?
            

            A big bonus is the funny and learned Foreword by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy Blount, Jr. Needed</ENAMEX> is a different term for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humorist</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blount</ENAMEX>.  This one suggests the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> of being funny, and
conveys nothing of the surprise and delight at observations
that cause explosions of laughter.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreword</ENAMEX> is
itself worth the price, which easily makes The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F Word</ENAMEX> a
double bargain.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Musical Punstruments</ENAMEX>
            Salvationist, ex-army <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bugler</ENAMEX>, retired marine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventor</ENAMEX>, paronomasiamaniac, you name it, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zach</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold</ENAMEX> has been or is it.  He cites <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byron</ENAMEX>'s lines from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan</ENAMEX> :  There's music in all things, if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> had ears, and
then sets out with passionate vim to prove the point.  The
genial wheeze was to construct playable instrument
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sculptures</ENAMEX>, and to christen them with music-related puns
(e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuba Toothpaste</ENAMEX>).  Each of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> Heath
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robinsonsâ€”Rube Goldbergs</ENAMEX> to you Americansâ€”here
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> conceals a miniature <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">harmonica</ENAMEX> (diatonic and
with the range of a full octave).

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zach Arnold</ENAMEX> is fully versed in the theory and practice
of punning, and clearly has it in his bones.  He knows
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about LÃ</NUMEX>©vi-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strauss</ENAMEX>'s notion of intellectual do-it-yourself
( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">bricolage</NUMEX> ).  Each of his punstruments creatively cannibalizes
and recycles <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">preexisting materials</ENAMEX>, all that comes
to hand.  He is fully aware, too, of the very ancient tradition
of the rebus, the pictorial pun.  Not letting his own
exuberance run away with him, he prudently issues a
safety warning about the manipulation of tools and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>.
Throughout, rhetoric, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> of speech, music,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">handymanship feed productively</ENAMEX> and voraciously off
each other.

            After all, the pun is, in (typically) more senses than
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, first a mock-up and then, if it works, a working model.
As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freud</ENAMEX> underlined, playing on the multiple meanings
of words is an exercise in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">thrift</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more meanings
for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> word or phrase.  Wit is psychic economy.  In more
technological terms, like the computer, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold</ENAMEX> says, the
pun enables a continuous flip-flop (though flip gags often
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flop</ENAMEX>).  The computer's version of this is a switching between
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> (unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mates</ENAMEX>), but of course any shuttling
begets an element of instability, wobble, neitherone-thing-nor-the-other.

            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arnoldian</ENAMEX> examples: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shoe Horn</ENAMEX> and Soul
Music, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jello Dali</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orange-juice Harp</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knocked Urn</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea</ENAMEX> (did you wince?  That is a clichÃ©ic, kneejerk reaction,
and you should be ashamed of yourself), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valse Teeth</ENAMEX>.
Infected, I cooked up: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baby Sitar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bad Vibes, King Gong</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-saxophone</ENAMEX> (scooped there, I think, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christine</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brooke-Rose</ENAMEX>).  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Punning</ENAMEX> is often, as with the suck-blow
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mouth</ENAMEX>-organ, vamping, i.e., harping, extracting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> out
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX>, or camping around.  The punner like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arnold</ENAMEX>
prolifically spawns neologisms, inkhorn terms, even nonce-words.
As well as being purely verbal, the pun can be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">visual</ENAMEX>, kinetic, gestural.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold</ENAMEX> in fact offers useful tips
(patter, stage-business) for performing his pieces, rather
like the word-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">balloons</ENAMEX> in cartoons.

            As it is the humble, brazen harmonica, he suggests
for the repertoire pop songs of all epochs or popular classics.
As always in any collection of wordplays, manyâ€”
mostâ€”are terrible or toothless (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tuning Fork</ENAMEX> , which
lacks the desirable distance between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> items suddenly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conjoined</ENAMEX>).  He is fully conscious of his own, for which
he coins cacohomonym.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swift</ENAMEX> said that like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fleas</ENAMEX>, puns get everywhere.  The
impulse in this book is macaronic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hybrid</ENAMEX>, adhocist, ecumenical,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">miscegenating</ENAMEX>.  Example: A sabot <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>, although
one could use it on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any day of the week</TIMEX> and not just on
the sabat or shabath , which immediately tempts <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to
throw the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> out with the shabath , probably the best
solution â€”if somewhat murky and not potableâ€”after all.
This has the pseudo-shamefaced but essentially brass-necked
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mark</ENAMEX> of the inveterate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">punner</ENAMEX>.  There is, of course,
method in his madness (it has been claimed that puns introduce
lunacy into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX>, but it was there all along), and
capering wordcaprice in his pedantry.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brigid Brophy</ENAMEX>
pointed out to me the musical puns in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mozart</ENAMEX>, where the
horns sound forth on occasion to intimate cuckoldry.

            Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Onan</ENAMEX>, I am not myself a handyman, nor can
I play anything except <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">cricket</ENAMEX> or hooky.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold</ENAMEX>, like Georges
Perec, provides his own mode <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d'emploi</ENAMEX> , instructions for
use.  All you need, apparently, is a lathe, a sharp knife, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> saw (not to be confused with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawk</ENAMEX>), manual dexterity,
dedication, and the requisite amount of the higher
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lunacy</ENAMEX> (though, like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hamlet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arnold</ENAMEX> is but mad northnorth-west),
and you too could say: I can do that.  Gizza
job.

            This book is highly sophisticated and deeply naive,
just as punning is adult/childish, iuvenis senex ; ingenuity
and ingenuousness rub matey shoulders.  All proceeds go
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salvation Army</ENAMEX>.  So salve your conscience, and save
your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>, by buying it.

            A letter from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. Alan Swanson</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXI,3,21</NUMEX>] claims that
the original name for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX> was The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golden Beatles</ENAMEX>.
This caught my eye right away as it is a well-known
fact among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles fans</ENAMEX> that one of the original names
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> was The Silver <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX>.  This name appeared
after a few changes in line-up of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and in
their name, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Quarrymen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moondogs</ENAMEX>.

            After reading through some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX> literature, it
becomes obvious there are some inconsistencies as to
how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX> chose The Silver <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX> after calling
themselves <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Johnny and the Moondogs</ENAMEX>, though the fact
remains that they never called themselves The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX>.  The best explanation for the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX> can
be traced directly to the music that influenced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lennon</ENAMEX>,
McCartney, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrison</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutcliffe</ENAMEX> at the time and to
their music idol, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddy Holly</ENAMEX>.  The music of the early
1960s in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Liverpool</ENAMEX> area was often referred to as beat
music, and so, modeling themselves after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holly</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>, the
Crickets, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>, who couldn't resist a pun, suggested
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beatles</ENAMEX> as a play on beat music.

            

            Where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX> got Silver from is harder to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trace</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> claims that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> was an obscure
reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Long John Silver</ENAMEX>,  highlighting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lennon</ENAMEX>'s role as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band leader</ENAMEX>.  This proves true when recalling other
band names from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1960s</TIMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerry</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacemakers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rory Storm</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hurricanes</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derry</ENAMEX> and the Seniors, all names that point out that one
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>.  Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have dismissed the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adjective Silver</ENAMEX> as merely an addition to give the name
some flash. 
            

            The language of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX>, what they said, what they
wrote about, and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all what they called themselves,
is an important part of Western culture.




         
         

            Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> in these matters [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cf.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin Ortiz</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Gambling Scams , p. 189</ENAMEX>] agree that the broads tossed or
faked in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-card monte [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXII,3,15</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">item 5</ENAMEX>] are not
specifically the queens; rather, the reference is to pasteboards
that are wider than the standard deck (viz. pokersized
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cards</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>-sized), which makes cheating by
sleight-of-hand easier in that game.




         
         

            I have just read Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William H. Dougherty</ENAMEX>'s EPISTOLA
[XXII<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX>] on the subject of balagan in which he refers
to a previous contribution by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton Horowitz</ENAMEX>.  Surely,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> for carrying the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> word into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli Hebrew</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>!  And in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>, balagan
means mess, bedlam.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uriel Weinreich</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YIVO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>)

            It is not unknown, I think, that meanings change
when words cross language frontiers, and what was a temporary
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booth</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> fair (quite probably a chaotic,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">noisy</ENAMEX> affair) becomes a mess and a bedlam in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>.  As
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>, I hate to see its influence ignored in
such a lengthy etymological review.




         
         

            [Undoubtedly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uriel Weinreich</ENAMEX> would have offered the
same remark himself, as his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Languages</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contact</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1953</TIMEX>)
made the point many times over.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€”Editor</ENAMEX>.]

            In his piece, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Day They Took the Peck</ENAMEX> out of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pecksniffian</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Briggs</ENAMEX> observed, There
is a movement to decriminalize the meanings of words
that once described criminal conduct in unmistakable
terms.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amen</ENAMEX>.  And I have an additional example of what
he means.

            I am a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '20s</TIMEX>, a time when those who were
involved in what was then (I believe) a minuscule drug
problem in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> were called dope <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fiends</ENAMEX>.  The implication
for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> or youth, quite intentional I am sure,
was that anybody who took <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> (dope) was not only to
be avoided, but also feared.  To this day I carry that reaction
to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">narcotics</ENAMEX> is commonly
referred to as doing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> , a phrase that seems to
imply a harmless activity such as doing the samba .  Alternatively,
one perhaps might be into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> , as if he were
dabbling in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more little pastime whose attraction would
ultimately fade as he got into something else.

            These locutions would be of little importance, I think,
if it were not for the fact that they have been adopted by
most of the news media and the entertainment industry.
Nobody uses dope fiend any more, even referring to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addicts</ENAMEX>
who regularly overdose.  And in that word overdose we have
yet another euphemism, don't we, as if there were such
a thing as a beneficent normal dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX> or crack.
As Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briggs</ENAMEX> seems to be saying, ideas have consequences,
and so do the words that express them.

            On another subject in the same issue, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Mansbridge</ENAMEX>'s
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intrusive S</ENAMEX> reminded me of another intrusion,
or rather a transposition, that I seem to be hearing
more and more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>.  It happens when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>
wants to modify the adjective another , and comes up
(turns around?) with That's a whole another subject.

            Words are fun if we keep our tempersâ€”and as long
as we have VERBATIM.




         
         

            An EPISTOLA from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim M. Pols</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXII,4</NUMEX>] refers to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> in XXII<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome Betts</ENAMEX> concerning names that
match their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">possessors</ENAMEX>' professions.  It has triggered an old
memory from my high-school <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost 70 years ago</TIMEX>)
when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> cited, as presumably authentic, the story
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> to a little western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> who noticed a shingle
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reading A. Swindler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at</NUMEX>-Law.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> pointed
out the unfortunate conjunction, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> simply
protested that it was actually his name.  Suggested the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">visitor</ENAMEX>, Why don't you at least substitute your whole first
name for that awful A?  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> sadly replied, It's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam</ENAMEX>.




         
         

            In A Proper Look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verbs</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXII,4,4</NUMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Ross</ENAMEX>
writesâ€”accurately soâ€”of the pervasion and intrusion of
proper verbs into our language alongside proper nouns
and proper adjectives.  Being from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> side of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readership</ENAMEX>, he may not be aware of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>
invasion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Northwest</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californians</ENAMEX> have relocated to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> for
personal or job-related reasons, and many, many Washingtonians
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oregonians</ENAMEX> do not like it at all.

            The bumper sticker in the accompanying photo uses
a proper verb to reflect that prevalent <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Northwest</ENAMEX>
opinion concerning their new, ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>.



         
         

            In response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray Zimmerman</ENAMEX>'s review of
A <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sea of Words</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXII,4</NUMEX>], I enclose a copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Patrick</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O'Brian Newsletter</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1994</TIMEX> containing an explanation
of the word marthambles:

               
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marthambles</ENAMEX> is a very fine word that I found in a
quack's pamphlet of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 17th</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 18th century</TIMEX>
advising a nostrum that would cure not only the strong
fires and a whole variety of more obvious diseases but
the marthambles too.  I have never see it anywhere else
and it has escaped the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX>.

            If my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> townsman Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Loeb</ENAMEX> was
impressed with the licence plate 2THMD [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>], may
I suggest that he stroll over to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bathurst Street</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any weekday</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">rush hour</TIMEX> and wait for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2TH LES</ENAMEX> to drive by.  Primary,
secondary, and (someday, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Apollonia</ENAMEX> forfend, mine own
teeth should fall out) tertiary appropriateness is his for
the viewing.



         
         

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hilary Howard</ENAMEX>'s article [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXII,1</NUMEX>] brings up the song
A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boy Named Sue</ENAMEX>.  I knew a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sue</ENAMEX>, a distinguished
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> in my home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, but he spelled it
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sioux</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sioux Falls</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX>.  He
named his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suzanne</ENAMEX>, but his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> was named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>.

            I also knew a girl named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>.  She was called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billie</ENAMEX>,
but her given name was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Lee</ENAMEX>.  Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s name was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee</ENAMEX>, and she was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> and last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in the
family, so they must have given up on having a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> who
could carry on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s name.

            In a high-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> Shirleys we also
had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shirley</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugee</ENAMEX> from the blitz in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>.
With that name and a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> accent he could well
have become the butt of ridicule, but he quickly became
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> when someone gave him a more appropriate
nickname, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shirts</ENAMEX>.




         
         

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc A. Schindler</ENAMEX>'s potentially important piece, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elementary</ENAMEX>,
My Dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Medeleev</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXII,4</NUMEX>] is unfortunately
marred by some bloopers.

            
               Hydrogen is a name of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> origin, not <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>.  It
is called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wasserstoff</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> (not Wasserstoffe).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kohlenstoff</ENAMEX> (not Kohlstoffe) means carbon, not charcoal
(which is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holzkohle</ENAMEX> ).  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sauerstoff</ENAMEX> (not Sauerstoffe) and for nitrogen Stickstoff
(not Stickstoffe).  English nitrogen comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nitron</ENAMEX> (not natron).  The name of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gallium</ENAMEX> is not only a
pun on the name of its discoverer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lecoq de Boisbaudran</ENAMEX>,
but a patriotic tribute to his native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">countryâ€”Latin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gallia</ENAMEX> ,
Gaul, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>.

            The history of the discovery and naming of the lanthanides
(the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rare-earth elements</ENAMEX> with atomic
numbers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58 to 71</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mendeleev</ENAMEX>'s table) is fascinating.  In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1788</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral ytterbite</ENAMEX> (now gadolinite ) was discovered
near the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> (not town) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ytterby</ENAMEX>.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gadolin</ENAMEX> isolated a new earth (metallic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxide</ENAMEX>) there in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1794</TIMEX> and called it yttria .  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1803</TIMEX> the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swedish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berzelius</ENAMEX> discovered another <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> and
named it cerium , for the asteroid (minor planet) Ceres.

            Take just yttria .  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1843</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemist</ENAMEX>
Mosander analysed this earth into yttrium proper, erbium ,
and terbium , all named for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ytterby</ENAMEX>.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1878</TIMEX> the Swiss
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chemist Marignac</ENAMEX> further isolated ytterbium , and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1879</TIMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cleve</ENAMEX> distinguished holmium (named
for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stockholm</ENAMEX>) and thulium (from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thule</ENAMEX>, the farthest
land known to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX>).  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1886</TIMEX> the aforesaid <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lecoq</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Boisbaudran</ENAMEX> (who had already discovered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gallium</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1875</TIMEX>) isolated dysprosium (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> for difficult to reach).
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1907</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Urbain</ENAMEX> separated lutetium
from ytterbium, naming it for his native <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman</ENAMEX>
name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lutetia</ENAMEX> ).

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cerium</ENAMEX> has its own, similar development, so that by
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 20th century</TIMEX> all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lanthanides</ENAMEX> had been isolated.
(The element with atomic number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> is not found
naturally, and this number was allocated to promethium ,
when proof of its existence was confirmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chemists</ENAMEX>, who named it for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prometheus</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> mythology
the earliest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> and benefactor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX>.)



         
         

            Ex tempore <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>, whether private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> unused
to explaining themselves before large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> or public figures
long used to it, may flounder about when unexpectedly
faced with camera or microphone.  They may
struggle to find the right word and, if they succeed, may
mispronounce it.  Such lapses, surely, may be forgiven.
Charity, however, does have its limits and cannot be
stretched to cover the following:

            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 7, 1996</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maine Public Radio</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcer</ENAMEX>,
reading the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> news report, spoke of a local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">philanthropist</ENAMEX>
who was doughnutting something-or-otherâ€”I
did not learn what because I was straining to understand
that mysterious verb and, too late, realized donating had
been meant.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1996</TIMEX>, a political advertisement on
television used the word <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislator</ENAMEX> when the context made
clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX> was intended.  That ad disappeared
after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX>; I wish I could feel confident that its
removal was caused by concern for the language.  Again
and again one hears local and national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">broadcasters</ENAMEX> according
an extra syllable to past participles as if the words
were back-formed from adverbs, e.g., allegÃ¨d, assurÃ¨d,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">composÃ¨d</ENAMEX>, markÃ¨d, suffusÃ¨d, supposÃ¨d.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anchor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Brokaw</ENAMEX>, who regularly says <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bo`l</ENAMEX> and
Clin`on, recently introduced a report on brust <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
A slip of the tongue, perhaps; but, during one memorable
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-week</TIMEX> period in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving week</TIMEX>
and ending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2</TIMEX>, while reporting on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bihac</ENAMEX>, he came
up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bihar, Bihak</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bihash</ENAMEX> before getting it
right.  Is that acceptable?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> has its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pronunciation Unit</ENAMEX> which advises on

            Turns of Phrase



            How long is it since you turned round and gave someone
a good earful?  And did he or she turn round and give
as good as they got?

            You might turn round to me and say you don't know
what I'm on about.  In which case I am liable to turn round
to you and say, Of course you do.  Open your ears.

            But beware.  You may find this particular speech habit
to be like the creaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> outside the window: it was
always there but you never heard it.  Once you hear it you
scarcely hear anything else.

            Why do we twist and spin before we speak?  Is it a
ritual?  A spell to ward off contradiction?  A dance of selfjustification?
Certainly, it usually carries some hint of
aggression, and, as always, vindication is in the mouth of
the utterer.

            If you turn round and do it to me, it probably means
you are being duplicitous in some wayâ€”switching allegiance;
reversing an opinion.  A turncoat, perhaps.  She
turned round and told me she always knew I had the
dress sense of a bag-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>.

            We might term this <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Turning Round</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Offering</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bare-faced Cheek</ENAMEX>.  The orbiting full moon, perhaps.

            Consumer grievances are particularly rich in these
audacious revolutions.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Retailers</ENAMEX> seem to turn round wholesale
on their hapless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> with outrageous demands.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gas Board</ENAMEX> turned round and said I had to pay for
their cock-up.  This is called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Turning Round and Moving</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goalposts</ENAMEX>.

            If, on the other hand, I turn round and do it to you,
it probably means that I am turning in heroic defiance,
wheeling in righteous indignation, turning on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tormentors</ENAMEX>.
I turned round and told them I wasn't going to
take it lying down.  This is known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turning Round</ENAMEX> and
Standing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">One's Ground</ENAMEX>.

            The average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>'s listening to talk radio will provide
a vertiginous selection of all these categoriesâ€”plus, of
course, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Political Revolution</ENAMEX>.  That is not, as previously
thought, the overthrow of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faction</ENAMEX> by another but
describes those occasions when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> reverses his
position while claiming consistency of stance.

            That is called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Turning Round and Steering a Steady</ENAMEX>
Course and appears on Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spin Doctor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Manual</ENAMEX>.

            The piÃ¨ce-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de-rÃ©sistance</ENAMEX> of the rotating phrase, however,
came when my own step-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> told me of an
aggravated duet (or should that be roundelay?) between
herself and her habitual sparring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>.  After an epic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of personal pirouettes she delivered the knockout
punch with the following:
I told her to her face, [an aberrant piece of straighttalking,
this] Don't you turn round to me and tell me I
turned round and accused you of being <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-faced.

            Thus creating, in the true sense of the term, a circular
argument.  Dizzying stuff, eh?

         
         
            To <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coin</ENAMEX> a Name and Name a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coin</ENAMEX>




            Around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years ago</TIMEX>, not long after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> replaced
its green Queen's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">one-dollar</NUMEX> note with an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX>-sided
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>-coloured coin, a schoolyard ditty made the rounds:



We're tiny, we're tuney
We haven't got a loonie
Because of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Mulroney</ENAMEX>
and the stupid <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.S.T.</ENAMEX>
            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mulroney</ENAMEX> rhymes with loonie .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Mulroney</ENAMEX> was
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> at the time.  The most unpopular
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>'s modem history, he introduced the
Goods and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Tax</ENAMEX>, a VAT-like national sales tax.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loonie</ENAMEX> is the well-nigh universal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> slang term for
the dollar coin.  (Only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Canadian Mint</ENAMEX> refers to
the loonie as a dollar coin.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> almost didn't have a loonie.  The original
design for the reverse side of the coin featured a voyageurâ€”
the same as on the older <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nickel dollarâ</ENAMEX>€”but the dies were
stolen on the way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Canadian Mint</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winnipeg</ENAMEX>,
where the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> coins were due to be minted.  The backup
design was that of a loonâ€”our unofficial national <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>.  Ah,
but that unfortunate name: loon as in loony bin!  Although
the terms loonie , a diminutive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">noun</ENAMEX> from loon , and loony ,
an adjective (ultimately) from lunar are etymologically
distinct, their similarity has encouraged obvious satirical
connections: our economy, which is loony, has as its
fundamental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of currency the loonie; many felt that
the policies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Mulroney</ENAMEX> were loony.  In short,
the slang term sprang up immediately and collectively, and
no one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> could ever claim to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventor</ENAMEX> of it.

            However, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-dollar coin is due to be introduced
soon in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, and the etymological situation here is a
totally different story.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mint</ENAMEX>, as usual, is no helpâ€”they
refer to the new coin unimaginatively as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-dollar
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coin</ENAMEX>, so the letters columns of every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> have been filled with speculation and suggestions
for a slang term for this new coin, which is slightly larger
than the loonie, gold-coloured and polygonal (like the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loonie</ENAMEX>), but with a silver centre with a polar bear pictured
on it.  Once the design was released, the name bruin was
suggested by many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, but the name that appears to
be winning is doubloonie, combining the double loonie
with a reference to a traditional coin said to be favoured
by piratesâ€”again, a not-too-subtle satirical reference to
the appetite for taxation of most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>.

            I may have the dubious distinction of being the first
to propose this name in a letter-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> published
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> of record, The [<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> and
Mail , on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 February 1993</TIMEX>, long before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mint</ENAMEX> announced
the coin.  At that time the idea had occurred to me because
I knew that both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-dollar
and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two-dollar</NUMEX> coins: I had been to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> several
times on business and had seen them.  To me, it
appeared to be just a matter of time before <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> also
introduced a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-dollar coin but it took an article in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe and Mail</ENAMEX> on the need for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-dollar coin to concentrate
a kind of critical mass of public attention onto
the issue.  What actually appears to happen in cases like
this is that neologisms do not appear like a single light bulb
going off in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> but rather like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX> after
spring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rains</ENAMEX>: if the ground is fertile the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> germinates
throughout the field.

         
         
            It Figures



            When it comes to counting, I have always been in awe
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolchildren</ENAMEX>.  How do they manage to do
mental arithmetic with numbers such as quatre-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">vingtdix</NUMEX>-sept
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four twenties</TIMEX> plus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seventeen</ENAMEX> and soixante-quinze
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sixty</NUMEX> plus fifteen, which require mental agility just to
translate them into the figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">97 and 75</TIMEX>?  The comparable
English <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> score <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> is certainly more
poetic than the simpler seventy , but I doubt whether it
was ever used in calculations.

            It is hardly surprising that the French-speaking Swiss
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belgians</ENAMEX> prefer their own system which, like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>,
has separate words for seventy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">and ninety</NUMEX>.  They, along
with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>- and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German-speaking</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, would appear
to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> start over the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> system
of saying numbers in reverse order (like the old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> ) may even make calculations easier,
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are usually taught to start with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> column
before moving on to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the tens</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX>.

            My admiration for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> has, however, paled
into insignificance since I started learning to count money
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mina</ENAMEX>, a language spoken in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Togo</ENAMEX> and parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Benin</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ghana</ENAMEX>.  I was astounded to realize that illiterate market
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Benin</ENAMEX> has an illiteracy rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 75%</NUMEX>) happily
multiply <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> by thirteen and add <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred</NUMEX> while
my brain is still struggling to work out whether this comes
to more or less than 150.

            Counting money in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mina</ENAMEX> involves using multiples of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> as far as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and then using a combination of
multiples of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-five</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five as far as one hundred</NUMEX>.
Even numbers greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> are sometimes expressed
as multiples of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>.  This means that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180</NUMEX> CFA
francs can be expressed as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred</NUMEX> plus <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen fives</TIMEX>,
or as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred</NUMEX> plus <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three twenty-fives</TIMEX> plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>, or yet
again as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-fives</TIMEX> plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>.

            After this humbling experience I am inclined to
review my earlier belief that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> must be at
a disadvantage when it comes to mental arithmetic.  In fact,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who grow up speaking a language such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mina</ENAMEX>, which obliges them to make connections between
numbers and introduces them to multiples at a very early
age, probably take to arithmetic faster than those who plod
along adding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to the previous number ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">infinitum</ENAMEX> .
