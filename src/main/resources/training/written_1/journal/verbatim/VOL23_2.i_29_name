            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Some years ago</TIMEX>, when sportscaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Barber</ENAMEX>
used Southern expressions like sitting in the catbird
seat and tearing up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pea</ENAMEX> patch , there was a degree
of national amusement.  Unfortunately, much of
this colorful speech has been lost as the language has
become homogenized through raido and television.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sigmund Freud</ENAMEX> is not blameless.  Thanks to him, we
are all nowadays more or less selfconscious.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> that came of age in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
decades of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the century</TIMEX> was probably the last of the
unselfconscious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breed</ENAMEX>.  And because there was much
less travel in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX>, the regions retained their
speechways much more completely than they do now.
Later, however, especially during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, there
was considerable mobility from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southerners</ENAMEX> who went up <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North</ENAMEX> were quickly made
aware of curiosities of speech like I'm fixing to do
something or go somewhere.  And there was hilarity
among <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northerners</ENAMEX>, for instance, when a Southerner
asked, Who's carrying you to the dance?  Carry in
Southernese meant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">escort</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Hush puppies</ENAMEX> and hoe
cakes were also terms sure to attact attention fifty
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, but are now in common use.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hoe cakes ,</ENAMEX>
originally baked on hoe, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hush puppies</ENAMEX> , allegedly
so named because pieces of them were fed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> to
keep them quite, are variations of what <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southerners</ENAMEX>
call corn <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Englanders</ENAMEX> call (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">spider</ENAMEX>)
johnnycake: spider because it was baked in a spider , a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">black</ENAMEX>, cast-iron skillet.  And when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Northern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South</ENAMEX> first saw black-eyed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX>, they were puzzled.
We call these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX> , they would say.  When
we say <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX>, we mean what <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southerners</ENAMEX> call English
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX> or green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX>.  Northerners were also amused
at a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> matriarch's saying to a tardy arrival at
the dinner table, We've waited for you the way one
pig waits for another.

            Those were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of the enormous <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX>
meal.  Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> worked close to home, and the paterfamilias
as well as all school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> came home
for dinner.  It was the custom to cook large quantities
of many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> breads for this
meal.  Yeast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> was called light <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> and corn
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> was corn pone, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn dodgers</ENAMEX>, hoecake, or hush
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppies</ENAMEX> .  Even in small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX> were
prepared at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX>.  One could never tell how many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> might drop in.  In big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, the cook customarily
went to her own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX> or to the curb market ,
now called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>' marker , to lay in a big
supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> and fruit.  Usually, enough was
cooked for supper, too.  However, if everything came
out even with nothing left over, the meal came out like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie Ross</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> .  If some foold was particularly tasty,
beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">delicious</ENAMEX>, it was larruping .  If someone ate too
much, he had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hog</ENAMEX>'s bait .  The word bait used as a
noun meaning sufficiency is given in few language
references.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern</ENAMEX> parlance, a bait ment more
than enough.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hog</ENAMEX>'s bait was a gluttonous plenty.
She has more than she can say grace over, was another
expression which seems to have disappeared.
Even though it refers to grace before <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> and thus
means that the materfamilias has more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to feed
than she can manage, the term was used in many situations
of someone whose load was too heavy.

            If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, in early attempts at cookery, made a
mess, it was a mommick or a begarm , both of which
were used as noun and verb.  However, the word bollix ,
meaning to bungle, was used only as a verb.  Bollix
is the only one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> terms listed in most language
references.  It is a safe bet that many who use
the term bollix (informal) do not know that it is a variant
spelling of ballocks (vulgar) testes.

            Before store-bought clothing was available, homemade
was the rule.  During a fitting, if something was
too tight,  it was as tight as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick</ENAMEX>'s hat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> and would
have to be altered.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Girls</ENAMEX> learned to sew at an early
age.  For some it was a slow and tedious business, but
others picked it up fast and sewed with a red hot needle
and a burning thread .  Although it is standard to
use the adverb directly for right away, it is not used as
much now in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX> as formerly.  I'll be
there directly, sometimes contracted to treckly, was
frequently heard as was in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> shakes of a dead
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sheep</ENAMEX>'s tail , a colorful hunorous variant on the usual in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> shakes of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lamb</ENAMEX>'s tail .

            A bossy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> was the old ballyo (bell ewe?),
and of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who put on airs, it was said, She's got
a b-i-g place .  If plans went haywire, they went skywest
and crooked .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> were warned not to go at
some task with main strength and awkwardness or
not to go whalestaving at some job.  When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX>
overdid some subject, they were told not to make
a blowing horn of it .

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early days</TIMEX> of TV, dancing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> blanketed
the air waves.  This early dancing was fairly frenzied
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gyrating which S.J. Perelman</ENAMEX> labeled fire-in-awhorehouse
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">choreography</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oldsters</ENAMEX> called it didapping :
Why are they didapping all over the place like
that, some would ask.

            Few things are as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> as antiquated slang; consider
the terms dandy-funk and hambeaters , circa
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1910</TIMEX>.  Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, it was said, wore dandy-funk on
their hambeaters.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dandy-funk</ENAMEX> is perfume and hambeaters
are the long tails of a swallow-tailed coat,
widely worn during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that period</TIMEX>.  Another relic of that
period, not heard any more, is the call to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> for
household help: Come quick and see old Ringdie!
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> is unknown; perhaps it originated when a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ring</ENAMEX> was in his death throes and the family
were being called.  Ringdie was said as one word,
and the call was made if one wanted quick response.

            Some of the common comparisons were: slow as
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven-year</TIMEX> itch, mad as a biting sow, though as
withleather, fierce as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">boar hog</ENAMEX>, flat as a flitter , and
hot as flugens .  Neither fitter (in this sense) nor flugens
appears in any readily available <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> dialect
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reference</ENAMEX>, nor do they appear to be related to
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> words of similar sound.  Nor does the prized
gold <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> .  If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, an employee, for example,
was highly valued, it was said, His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> wouldn't trade
him of a gold <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX>.

            Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> learned the right way to spell <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>, i, crooked letter, crooked letter, i, crooked letter,
crooked letter, i, humpback, humpback, i .

            The earlier generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> wanted hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biscuits</ENAMEX>
for breakfast and spoke disparagingly of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baker</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wasps</ENAMEX>' nests .  <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Skim milk</ENAMEX> was blue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> , a
widely used term.  Also common was the term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankee</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dime</ENAMEX> , as in not worth a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yankee</ENAMEX> dime.  This regionalism
was used mainly at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>: if a person
wanted to make it clear he had not given a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> (?)
a gift, he would say, I gave him a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yankee</ENAMEX> dime.  The
term means a kiss but was used disparagingly, as in to
kiss off .  Not in any reference work I checked, it is
probably a relic of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil</ENAMEX>
War, as is the term gone to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> .  The latter refers
to property which had been appropriated because the
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home ovwner</ENAMEX> had not paid taxes on it.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> was indeed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bible Belt</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.L.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mencken</ENAMEX> labeled it.  However not only the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>, but
the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> was caught up in religious revivalism
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early decades of the century</TIMEX>.  The best-known
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> revivalists were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Jennings Bryan</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William A.  Billie</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>.  But there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX>
of lesser-known revivalists whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> blanketed
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>.  These revivals usually lasted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> and were also called rotracted meetings .
During the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers</TIMEX>, every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> had
its revival tent where repentant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sinners</ENAMEX> walked down
the aisle, the sawdust trail , to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mourners</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bench</ENAMEX> for
prayer and sometimes emotional repentance.  Ordinary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, genuinely tried to be
good in word and deed.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were probably
damaged beyond repair because they were not allowed
to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord</ENAMEX>'s name in vain, or to swear, i.e., use
words like devil and hell .  Instead of devil , they were to
say the bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> , and instead of hell, the bad place .
Churchgoers were told not to call anyone a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool</ENAMEX> no
matter how justified the label because there was an injuction
against it in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5:22</TIMEX>)

            Keeping the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabbath</ENAMEX> was also important.  Respectable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> never did a washing on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>.  And as
for sewing on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, the old superstition stated that if
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> sewed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, the devil would make the
sinner rip every stitch with his/her nose.  Of course,
no one took this seriously.  However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">superstitions</ENAMEX> were taken seriously.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX>, known also in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, warned against giving knives as gifts: they
would cut the friendship.  The other warned against
watching a parting guest out of sight: bad luick would
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ensue</ENAMEX>.  Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superstition</ENAMEX> warned a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> contemplating
marriage, Change the name and not the letter,
change for worse and not for better.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old days</TIMEX>, a standard farewell was, You
keep out of meanness, hear?  Though it was often
used jokingly, it was the equivalent of the current
Have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a good day</TIMEX>.

            Anti-Language


            If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> use of language is to communicate, it
might come as a surprise to note a few of the
times when language is used specially to confuse
and alienate.

            Anti-languages do just this: their reason for existence
is to ensure secrecy by being understood by
only a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.  Once too many people
have cracked the code â€” most important, when those
who have done so are in some way opposed to the
anti-language's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> â€” the language becomes obsolete
and dies.

            Linguistically speaking, an anti-language is
formed by a process of relexicalization, which is substituting
new words for old.  The grammar of the original
language is kept, but a distinctive vocabulary
develops, quite often when referring to activities or
areas important to the subculture that the creating the
language.  Established society usually has its nose put
slightly out of joint in the process.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John S. Farmer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Its Analogues</ENAMEX> ,
wrote in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1890</TIMEX>, The borderland between slang
and the Queen's <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is an ill-defined territory, the
limits of which have never been clearly mapped out.
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguists</ENAMEX> who have taken on the chalenge of
doing so include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Green</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotten, Grose</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Morris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wentworth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flexner</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Partridge</ENAMEX>, who published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first</TIMEX> edition of
his enormous <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Slag</ENAMEX> and Unconvential
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX>.  Further back, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as long ago as 1792</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedrich Ch. Laukhard</ENAMEX> wrote, It is common knowledge
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> have a language that is quite peculiar
to them and that is not understood very well
outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> society....  But if the code of behaviour
somewhere is particularly lievly, then the language
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> is all the richer for itâ€”and vice
versa.

            Convicts shipped to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> spoke a criminal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">argot</ENAMEX> described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Hardy Vaux</ENAMEX> as flash language
in his <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">New and Comprehensive Vocabulary</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Flash Language</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1812</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vaux</ENAMEX>, in fact, was criminal
himself, but also a linguist; transported to the
colonies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times, he used the journeys as opportunities
for research.  Most of the words he lists (swag
being a notable exception) did not pass into mainstream
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian English</ENAMEX>.  Possibly some exist in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminal underword</ENAMEX> to this day.

            Let us look at the modern underworld.  In a
friendly manner <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are talking in the presence
of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, an impostor â€” a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detective</ENAMEX> or an investigative
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reporter â€”</ENAMEX> who believes he has infiltrated their
ranks.  His problem is that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are aware of
his deception.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> says to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, Shall
we clear up this mess?  No, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> replies,
we'll leave it for the cleaner.  Little does the impostor
know that he has just been sentenced to death,
for what was really said was, Shall we kill him?  No,
we'll leave it to a professional.  A cleaner is a hired
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gun</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assassin</ENAMEX> â€” or at least it was until recently.
Now the definition is too well known, and it will
shortly be dropping away.  Cleaner is a word which
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adheres</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> principle of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX>:
the word employed in the process of relexicalzation
should not itself be conspicuous.

            A great deal of argot appears to be ordinary language
â€” not only in the English-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sunderworld</ENAMEX>.
In india a sentence that translates into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as Go
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clean</ENAMEX> the bowl is used by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">murderer</ENAMEX> to an associate in
front of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX>.  It means Prepare a grave.  (Note
the similar links between murder and hygiene.) Few
studies, however, have been made into the language
of underground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, not least because of the dangers
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>.  We know that the language of the
Calcuttan underworld contains <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than forty</NUMEX> words
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> and more than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> .  Often,
the meanings of such code words are detected and
then they promptly go out of use; sometimes, they
are not detected at all.

            The same is true of the anti-language of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>.
Considerably more is known about grypserka â€”
the anti-language of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> â€” than about any
English-speaking system, but even that knowledge is
incomplete and out-of-date.

            The alternative, second life inside <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prisons</ENAMEX>
involves a complex caste system of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suckers</ENAMEX> ,
categories determined by the type of offence involved
and the length of incarceration.  Movement within
the hierarchy depends on sticking to the rules of a
game in which grypserka figures prominently.  An inmate
is downgraded to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sucker</ENAMEX> by breaking the rules,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of which is never, ever, to reveal the secrets of the
anti-language, no matter what pardon or privilege is
offered.  It is a concept well known in all prison systems.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX> would be grassing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> slang is readily enough available in any
prison drama or comedy: screw is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX>, snout is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tobacco</ENAMEX>, nonce is a child molester or other sex offender,
and nick or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porridge</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> itself.  This is
not anti-language, for we all understand it.  This outdated
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison slang</ENAMEX> is used almost nostalgically, in the
same way that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> still employ Cockney
rhyming slag (which was once itself an anti-language).

            Anti-language is not easy to define as it does not
have rigid rules to which a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subculture</ENAMEX>'s inventions
must conform.  Nor is it easy to determine its origins,
although historically an argot known as pelting speech
was employed by bands of ne'er-do-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> in Elizabethan
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX>.  There were over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> terms for
varying types of vagabond: rogue, prigger of prancers
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thief</ENAMEX>, counterfeit crank , and bawdy basket are
but a few.

            Both then and now, new vocabulary in key areas
lead to finer distinctions in meaning than are found
in the parent language.  There are many synonyms,
and for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> there is the comfort that comes
with the freedom to discuss illegal acts in public
places.

            While slang is not itself anti-language, it exhibits
some of its tendencies.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slag</ENAMEX> has as many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language has dialects.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Youth slag</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX>
slang, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> slang, gay slang, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CB</ENAMEX> slang â€” the list is
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">endless</TIMEX>.  And every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX> wants its own argot, a test by
which a potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruit</ENAMEX> can be measured: if you don't
know the language, very often you cannot get in; or, if
you are already in, not knowing the latest key words
can be disastrous for your credibility.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slang</ENAMEX> is a means of unification; for those who use
it, it is fun, unconventional, and sassy.  What is more,
it can be witty, picturesque, metaphoric.  How it differs
from anti-language is that while it often intends to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subvert</ENAMEX>, it does so by being understood (at least in
part) by the world at large.  Where the purpose of
anti-language is to be secretive, slang is often offensive.
It is used by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those4</TIMEX> who want it to be known that
they are a clique â€” not dangerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX>,
row.

            It is important to remember, however, that what
survives of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>'s slang may bacome the
next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>'s standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>.  Bus was the slang
term for omnibus, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> for zoological gardens , and
piano for pianoforte .

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> slang once used on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citizens</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Band</ENAMEX>
radio has similarities with anti-language, although
even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> more often regarded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> as eccentric
nuisances than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, however,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">revelled</ENAMEX> in their outlawed status; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> were well
represented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CB</ENAMEX> lexis.  They were bears or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">smokeys</ENAMEX> ; police <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, a bear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> or cave ; a police
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">helicopter</ENAMEX>, a bear in the air .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Police</ENAMEX> using radar were
kojaks with kadaks .  More confusingly, a police car
was a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">jam sandwich</ENAMEX> or a bubble<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-gum</ENAMEX> machine .  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CB</ENAMEX> expressions run along metaphorical pathways
is reminiscent of pelting speech.  <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood wagon</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon ambulance</ENAMEX> and dragging wagon tow
truck are like the much earlier crashing cheats teeth,
smelling-cheat nose, and belly cheat apron, where
cheat means thing to do with.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Teenage</ENAMEX> slang in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this decade</TIMEX> has been
strongly influenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> cultures,
by immigration, and by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX>.  Wrongly accused of
being a lazy language, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> slag is, in fact, as complex
and rhythmic as any dialect.  The words <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>,
well hard, wicked , and swear-words are not simply
idle padding for a sentence, they are an
intrinsic part of the language.  That so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>
disapprove of the way the youth communicate is precisely
what keeps this variety of slang going.

            This leads to the issue of talking Black.  Linguistically,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black English</ENAMEX> has origins in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>
(mainly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jamaican</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole</ENAMEX>.  Black <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, a patois,
does not vary much from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> and belongs
to an ethnically defined social <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX>
sittings its use ensures soldarity between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>; in
White or mixed sittings the use of the patois symbolizes
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> distance from mainstream society and an
assertion of ethnic identity.  The more linguistically
distinct the sounds of a patois, the more it can come
to symbolize social distance.  Here is approaches the
status of anti-language.  For some Black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>,
talking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX> provides a system of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> on a linguistic
level to a powerful social order.

            It has long since been noted that when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> people
who come from different social backgrounds
meet, there is often a tendency for their speech to
alter, so that they become more alike, a process known
as accommodation or convergence.  Its opposite â€” divergence
â€” occurs when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> wish to stress their
personal, social, religious, or sexual identity; divergence
takes on a position of confrontation, though is
often said to be a result of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>'s pride.  Anti-language
is divergence on a grand scale, and most varieties
of slang are at least sympathetic to the
philosophy and purposes of anti-language.

            Are we faced with the paradox in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> effectively use different languages?
Very unlikely.  But perhaps there will be a rethinking
of the word communication and an instinctive scintilla
of caution when communicating outside one's social
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>.
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grockles</ENAMEX> of Goodrington



            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 25th</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1995</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> in The
Archers , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC Radio</ENAMEX>'s long-running country
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">soap</ENAMEX>, mentioned spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> preparing
Lower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Loxley</ENAMEX> for an influx of grockles on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archers</ENAMEX> is set in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midlands</ENAMEX>, but it seems the
word grockle has trqanscended its southwestern connections
and become a widely distributed informal
term for tourist, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX>, or holidaymaker.
By extension, it can mean nonresident, nonlocal, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsider</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Thorne</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bloomsbury Dictionary of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Contemporary Slang</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>) claims that it has been
adopted by non-native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hippies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travellers</ENAMEX> living in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">West Country</ENAMEX> to refer to anyone who is not approved
of.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">OED2e</NUMEX> labels grockle as dialect and slang, of
uncertain origin , and mildly disparaging , as well as associating
it especially with southwest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>.  It provides
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> citations from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964 to 1986</TIMEX>, including
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Fowels</ENAMEX>' novel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Martin</ENAMEX> , and another referring
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Isle of Weight</ENAMEX>.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cornwall</ENAMEX> the word
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emmet</ENAMEX> is used with exactly the same meaning and is
likewise labelled mildly disparaging by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> ,
which gives <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> citations, both of which include
grockle , from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975 and 1984</TIMEX>.  Its meaning is presumably
transferred from the basic sense <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ant</ENAMEX>.  Indeed, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> quoted in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX> citation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Listener 20</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept.</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">23/1</ENAMEX>] regarded it, in comparison with grockle , as less
difficult and more vivid because its true meaning is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ant</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bloomsbury Dictionary</ENAMEX> claims it has been
used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cornwall</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>.

            There have been various attempts to illuminate
the uncertain origin of grockle , from the fanciful to
the plausible.  An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exeter University</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academic</ENAMEX> once
speculated, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, that it might come
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> graeculus , translated as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greekling</ENAMEX> with
a derogatory flavour.  It has often been derives from the
name of the clown <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grock</ENAMEX>, an allusion to the red sunburnt
noses of seaside holidaymakers.  That is the version
given in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Dictionary of Contemporary Slang</ENAMEX> , by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jonathon Green</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Books</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rev. ed</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>):



The term originated in the West Country, specifically
Torbay, where a local remarked that the stream of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> resembled little <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grocks</ENAMEX>, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clowns</ENAMEX>...
            

            A most detailed and circumstantial account of its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">genesis</ENAMEX>, which more than a little impresses me, also
traces its origin to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Torbay</ENAMEX> area and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comic</ENAMEX>, but
not of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grock</ENAMEX> variety.  This version claims that
grockle was the spontaneous coinage of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> in
the southwest holiday trade, prompted by an early
memory of a picture story in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s comic.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1952 and 1960</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Rivers</ENAMEX>, then in his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">twenties</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Londoner</ENAMEX> by birth, was in charge of
the boating-lake at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodrington</ENAMEX>, a district of Paignton
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Devon</ENAMEX>, now part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torbay</ENAMEX>.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 1955</TIMEX>
or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</TIMEX>, Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rivers</ENAMEX> saw among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> a tiny
old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> with beady eyes, a pointed nose and a ruddy,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">weatherbeaten</ENAMEX>, pinched-up face.  He was so struck by
her appearance that he observed to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> that
the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> was like a little grockle.  His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX>,
not surprisingly, replied, What the hell's a grockle?
Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rivers</ENAMEX> explained that he had been reminded of a
figure from a picture serial he had once read, called
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grockle</ENAMEX> .  The grockle was a small dragonlike
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX> with magic powers.  Mr rivers tells
me that he could not recall the name of the comic,
when he had seen it, and even whether it was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
or an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> import.

            The old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> equally diminutive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Country</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> regularly visited the boating-lake during their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">holiday</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> took a fancy to the expression Mr
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rivers</ENAMEX> had used and would say things like Your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grockle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>'s here and so on.  The term survived
the departure of the originals and was soon consciously
adopted for all the holidaying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons</ENAMEX>, mainly
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midlands</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX>, by the large number of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonal</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> at the lake.  Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rivers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie Fly</ENAMEX>, wrote an Ode to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grockle</ENAMEX> and the
coaches bringing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> were christened grockle
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wagons</ENAMEX> .  Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rivers</ENAMEX> has emphasized to me that the
word was not then used in a disparaging way, but
more as a kind of professional in-joke, with about the
same force as the now universal punter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX>,
part of the verbal comaraderie of a lively band
of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>.

            The word became current among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of
the boating-lake's local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and outlasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX>
to be acquired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> by other holiday trade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in
the area, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paignton</ENAMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> and local
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Carter</ENAMEX>.  In an article in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Torbay</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herald Express</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1993</TIMEX>), he remembered hearing
grockle for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1950s</TIMEX> when working
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodrington</ENAMEX> promenade.  From there it
would inevitably spread to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paignton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torquay</ENAMEX>, the
towns which, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brixham</ENAMEX>, now make up Torbay.

            By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1960s</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie Fly</ENAMEX> had become a
barman at a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brixham</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pub</ENAMEX> and there met a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Draper</ENAMEX>, who was working on a screenplay for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flim</ENAMEX> based on the adventures of seasonal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in
the holiday industry.  He picked up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie Fly</ENAMEX>'s use
of grockle to add authenticity to his script.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flim</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">starring Oliver Reed</ENAMEX>, was released in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX>
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">The System â</ENAMEX>€” the system being one to pull
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds â€”</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">The Girl-Getters</ENAMEX> , a more
explicit rendering of the same idea.  This was the first
national publicity for the hitherto local expression,
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> citation of grockle is, in fact, from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flims & Fliming</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31 October 1964</TIMEX>, extracted from a
review of what is presumably <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The System</ENAMEX> .

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Books</ENAMEX> published a halfcrown
paperback novelization by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Burke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peter</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Draper</ENAMEX>'s screenplay.  The text contained the film's extended
dialogue explanation of grockle (including
grockle-comforter for transistor raido and grocklebox
for cheap camera) as well as its other passing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">references</ENAMEX>, but added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about fifteen</NUMEX> more in the narrative,
with an example between quotation marks in
the back-cover blurb.  It may be that in pre-video
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days these</TIMEX> appearances in print, after the film had
ended its run in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX>, played a part in the
spread of the expression during the res of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>.

            The word was certainly hard to escape in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Torbay</ENAMEX> area in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1970s</TIMEX>, and by then often had
a derisive flavour, as friction increased between young
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> and young <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.  Hence Look at
those bloody grockles! from some trawlerman was
my own first encounter with it as I took a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> round <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brixham</ENAMEX>.  Stickers reading Nongrockle
could sometimes be seen in the rear windows
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> as an assertion of local identity.  The word had
also spawned more extensions, like grock-trap shop
selling tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sovenirs</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily Telegraph</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1986</TIMEX> (the last of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX>'s citations) also gives
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">grockle fodder fish</ENAMEX> and chips, grockle bait tourist
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">souvenirs</ENAMEX>, and grockle nests <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp sites</ENAMEX>.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Rivers</ENAMEX>, who had become the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX>
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Paignton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pub</ENAMEX>, took part in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radio Four</ENAMEX> programme
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Draper</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Carter</ENAMEX>, and an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>.  At the end, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presenter</ENAMEX>
handed Mr Rivers a photocopy from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX> issue of
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dandy</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">weekly</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s comic.  The
page heading was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">His Grockle</ENAMEX> , so Mr
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rivers</ENAMEX> was able to validate and localize the memory
that had floated to the surface of his mind in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid</TIMEX>
1950s.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grockle</ENAMEX> turned out to be onomatopoeic, being
all the little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dragon</ENAMEX> ever said.

            The first number of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Dandy</ENAMEX> , published by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Thomson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dundee</ENAMEX>, was dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 December 1937</TIMEX>,
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Rivers</ENAMEX> would have been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six or seven</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX>.  However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grockle</ENAMEX> had
started in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1932</TIMEX> as a conventional serial story in another
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Rover</ENAMEX> , before
being tracslated into picture strip form in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX>.
It ran again in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.C. Thomson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sparky</ENAMEX> from
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966 to 1976</TIMEX>.

            Perhaps it was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The System</ENAMEX> that helped grockle
to beome so far-flung and win out over the allegedly
more vivid but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> still <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cornwall</ENAMEX>-confined emmet .
But I personally would speculate that the unknown
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">creator</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Jimmy</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grockle</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1930s</TIMEX>
keew the sort of word that resonates in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">memories</ENAMEX>.  Could a further reason for the word's success
be that it rhymes with the name of a kind of edible
molluse that is a traditional feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
seaside <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holidays</TIMEX>?  It clearly seems to have appealed to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> of some verses in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shooting Times</ENAMEX> &
Country Magazine for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 August 1975</TIMEX> â€” not spotted
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> â€” which ran in part:



There are the like in other lands,
But here they call them grockles
And feed them on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> sands
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ice-cream</ENAMEX> and rock and cockles.
            
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latter-day English</ENAMEX>



            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Smith</ENAMEX> announced to the world in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 19th century</TIMEX> that he had seen God, and gave
to the world his <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Golden Bible</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Book of Mormon</ENAMEX>) , he
certainly introduced some radical new theologh.  However,
as his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX>, presecuted and harried out of the estern
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> to the godforsaken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX> of what is now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>, then
proceeded in build <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zion</ENAMEX> as they made the desert bloom,
they and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> have also contributed some
unique words to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language (or, in some cases,
some unique twists on existing words).

            A full exposition of strictly doctrinal terms is beyond
the scope of this article because such a listing would entail
a detailed examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mormon</ENAMEX> doctrine.  Speaking of
Mormon doctrine, the term, used as a general-purpose
noun, adjective, and adverb, as an unofficial designation for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</ENAMEX> and its adherents,
and comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Book of Mormon</ENAMEX> , a book
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Smith</ENAMEX> claims to have translated from gold
plates goven to him by an angle.  The book claims to be a
parallel to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>, but pertaining to the New World, and
relates the religious history of several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
Talking about the book in a scholarly way in somewhat
like discussing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tolkien</ENAMEX>'s works, which also contain a richly
developed cultural world.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tolkien</ENAMEX>'s case it is self-evident
that his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rings</ENAMEX> trilogy is a work of fiction, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-Moromons</ENAMEX> would probably assign the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Book of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mormon</ENAMEX> to the same category; but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mormons</ENAMEX> take
its truth seriously (whether strictly historical on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one end of</TIMEX>
a spectrum to mythologically symbolic on the other end),
albeit of faith.  This is by way of pointing out that Mormon
was the name of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the book, and it was
named after him, although he did not write the whole
book.

            Whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mormon</ENAMEX> was historical figure or a fictional
Character is a matter of faith, but many of the
names in the book do have roots in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Near Estern</ENAMEX> languages,
for whatever reason.  Several of the personal
names in the book are popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>' names amongst
Mormon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>; especially popular are Jared
(which is also the name of an obscure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Biblical personage</ENAMEX>,
but the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Book of Mormon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> has a far
greater profile), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helaman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nephi</ENAMEX> .  Current place
names in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> that come from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Book of Mormon</ENAMEX> include:
Bountiful, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lehi, Nephi, Manti, Moroni</ENAMEX> , and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deseret</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, not the territory).  There are numerous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biblical</ENAMEX> names as well: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paradise</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan River</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Goshen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ephraim</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Zion National Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount Carmel</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moab</ENAMEX> , as well as places named after
early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brigham</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grantsville</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Heber City</ENAMEX> and others.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jordan River</ENAMEX> is so called
because the geography of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> resembles that of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Utah</ENAMEX> drains via the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jordan River</ENAMEX> into the
Great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake</ENAMEX>, just as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sea of Galilee</ENAMEX> drains via the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan River</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">salty Dead Sea</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old World</ENAMEX> Zion
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World Zion</ENAMEX> are thus mirror images of each
other.  The names of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Fork</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish Fork</ENAMEX> bear special mention because of a peculiarity
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> pronunciation especially rural pronunciation:
locally these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> are known as American Fark
and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish Fark</ENAMEX>, respectively.

            An intriguing example of a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Book of Mormon</ENAMEX> place
name is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desert</ENAMEX> , which was a very popular name in Mormondom
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> was not allowed to
enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> until long after it had achieved the minimum
requirements for statehood (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1896</TIMEX>) because
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> at the time abhorred the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mormon</ENAMEX> practice of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polygamy</ENAMEX> (called plural marriage in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latter-day English</ENAMEX>).
Having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> was all right: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gentiles</ENAMEX> (nonMormons)
just disapproved of having them all at the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>!  Speaking of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gentiles</ENAMEX> , there is a story (perhaps apocryphal)
that the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX> and archaeologist,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yigael Yadin</ENAMEX>, once prefaced a speech at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> with the observation, You know, this is probably the
only place I can come and be a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gentile</ENAMEX>!

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> that preceded the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>
(named after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ute Indians</ENAMEX>) was called the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Territory</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Desert</ENAMEX> .  It is a term for the promised land in the
Book of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mormon</ENAMEX> and is supposed to mean land of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">honeybee</ENAMEX>.  It has been speculated that the word is related
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dâ</ENAMEX>€rt , a term for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Crown</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper Egypt</ENAMEX>, whose emblem was the bee.  In the 19th
century these was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deseret Industries</ENAMEX> .  The hive is
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> and appears on its coat-of-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desert</ENAMEX> covered an area much larger
than the modern-day state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>: parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idoho</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>
were all part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desert</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time.  A non-contiguous
part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mormon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mormon Country</ENAMEX> , an
area of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alberta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, which was settled by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mormons</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 19th century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marshals</ENAMEX> looking for polygamists).

            Several doctrinal terms bear mentioning.  Mormons
(<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">or Latter-day Saints</ENAMEX> , as well call ourselves-not out of a
sense of spiritual superiority, it is to be hoped, but because
of a reference of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Paul's</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the ancient
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> being called <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>) have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> basic types of
religious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>: chapels and temples and they are as different
as synogogues and temples are in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judaism</ENAMEX>.  A chapel
is a meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, but the area of assembly for worship
withinthe <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chapel building</ENAMEX> is alson called a chapel .
Traditionally there is also a cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> , which serves as
everything from an overflow for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX>, a basketball
court, an area for dramatic and musical productions, and
a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">wedding receptions</TIMEX>.  The main <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> meeting
â€” the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass â</ENAMEX>€” is called sacrament
meeting , sacrament in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mormon</ENAMEX> sense being
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> specific sacrament only: what other christians called
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eucharist</ENAMEX>.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> where, as a rule, no
meetings are held but where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mormons</ENAMEX> go for certain ceremonies,
including vicarious ordinances (ordinances on be
half of one's ancestors), for celestial marriages (technically,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">celestial</ENAMEX> marriage is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> of marriage that extends
past death, as generally understood, and the wedding
ceremony itself is called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> marriage ), and a
place where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> receives one's endowment .  An endowment
in this case is a ceremony at which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ritualizes
one's place in the universe, both with respect to God and
with respect to one's extended <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.  There are also tabernacles ,
which are large meeting places for special-purpose
meetings-the best-known one is; of course, the tabernacle
where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mormon Tabernacle Choir</ENAMEX> is based, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Square</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake City</ENAMEX>.

            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Smith</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brigham Young</ENAMEX>,
founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desert/Utah</ENAMEX>, he sent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX> out to places as far
away as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colonia Juarez</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cardston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alberta</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Bernardino</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, and all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX>,
Idoho, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>.  All of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were set
up in the same way, with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> wide enough to ensure a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of oxen could turn around.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> were organized
politically in a way presious <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mormon colonies</ENAMEX> in
the estern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kirtland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nauvoo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>)
were, into stakes and words .  The image of the stake comes
from the stakes used to hold up the tabernacle in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old</ENAMEX>
Testament <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it corresponds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly</NUMEX> to a diocese,
and is a collection of words.  The word started out as a political
subdivision, just like wards in most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, but became the equivalent of a parish.  Stakes are
headed by a stake <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> , a volunteer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> (there is no
professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergy</ENAMEX>), and wards are headed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX> .

            All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> from twelve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years of age</TIMEX> are eligible to
hold the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">priesthood ant</ENAMEX> it is this semi-universal priesthood
that governs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> (with participation by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in
some administrative roles, but outside the context of the
priesthood itself) and conducts its rituals.  The priesthood
is divided into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aaronic Priesthood</ENAMEX> , for young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>
from twelve to eighteen, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Melchizedek</ENAMEX> Priesthood
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult males</ENAMEX>.  Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> is divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>:
Decons are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-13</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teachers</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14-15</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Priest</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-17</NUMEX>;
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melchizedek Priesthood</ENAMEX> is divided horizontally
into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elders</ENAMEX> (you might have met some awfully
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yound Elders</ENAMEX> on your doorstep... ), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seventies</ENAMEX> , and
high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Priests</ENAMEX> .  The imagery comes from the time when
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX> went up <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Sinai</ENAMEX>, leaving a group of seventy at
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point and the edlers of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> behind them.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Moses</ENAMEX>
himself was, of course, the high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX>.

            Slang terms, unofficial terms and humour abounds
within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mormondom</ENAMEX>.  The humour column of an unofficial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scholarly</ENAMEX> publication, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sunstone</ENAMEX> , in called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Oxymormons</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> are referred to institutionally as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Relief Society</ENAMEX> ,
after the name of their auxiliary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> (founded by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Smith</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emma</ENAMEX>, it claims to be <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s oldest
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>).  To hold the priesthood is a euphemism
for any sort of physical affection displayed by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women towards men</ENAMEX> (since all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, at least in principle,
are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the priesthood); the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Word of Wisdom</ENAMEX> is a
reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mormons</ENAMEX>' dietary laws (which prohibit smoking,
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, and caffeine-containing hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>);
Primary is a reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> up to the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX>
(as with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Relief Society</ENAMEX>, this is an example of the name
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> being extended generally to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mormonism</ENAMEX> has a relatively well-defined theology,
but even in such a centralized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of thought there is
bound to be a specturm of beliefs and social attitudes.
What <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gentiles</ENAMEX> would call <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> and called liahonas by
Mormons, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> are called iron-rodders ,
both terms coming from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Book of Mormon</ENAMEX> images.

            And finally, what about splinter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, without which
no self-respecting religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> would be complete?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mormons</ENAMEX> who do not practice their religion are called
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Mormons</ENAMEX> , the largest schismatic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, The
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</ENAMEX> ,
(note the difference in spelling of latter-day) who did not
follow what they call the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> Mormons out west, but
stayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>, are called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reorganites</ENAMEX> , and although
Mormons have their share of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fundamentalists</ENAMEX>, to call
someone a fundamentalist in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mormondom</ENAMEX> is to accuse
him of being a closet polygamist.  The practice of polygamy
was outlawed just before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the century</TIMEX>, but
polygamous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> persist down to the present day.  One
has to admit, these terms represent an improvement over
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> term that used to be applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missourians</ENAMEX> during the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of persecution in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-19th century</TIMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>
state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX> still had an official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mormon</ENAMEX> extermination
order on its books until someone discovered it in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archives</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>): they were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">affectionat4ely</NUMEX> known as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pukes</ENAMEX> .
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Meaning of Murder</ENAMEX>



            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1991</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussien</ENAMEX>
cheered when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SCUD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX> fell on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel Aviv</ENAMEX>, calling
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">murderer</ENAMEX> for having bombed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX>.
At the same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX>, who had
cheered when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> bombed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX>, called
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">murderer</ENAMEX> for bombing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel Aviv</ENAMEX>.
Both sides agreed on what they meant by the word
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">murderer</ENAMEX> , mut they made opposite judgments as to
whom it applied and why.  How is that possible and
what does it tell us about how language works?

            
               Murder differs from kill in involving the notion of
justification.  To say that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> kills another is to
say that the first deprives the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> of life; but to say
that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> murders another is to say the depriving is
unjustified.  This raises the questions, What does justified
mean and How does one justify judgments about it?

            
               Justified falls among a class of words that also includes
what linguists call modals ; the most notable of
these are must, should , and can .  Despite their apparent
definiteness, the meanings of such words involve
an element of indeterminacy that someewhat
resembles ambiguity.

            
               Must assets that there are laws and facts that
jointly necessitate some occurrence, either already
completed or yet to be brought about, without specifying
exactly what those laws and facts are.  For example,
the context in which sentence (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) originally
appears makes it clear that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> intends it to express
a historical necessity already in place, based on
the law that time moves forward and on the fact that
a lot of time has passed.



(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)  Although precise figures must remain elusive,
according to the best current estimates a total of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 to 11 million</NUMEX> living slaves crossed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocean</ENAMEX> from the sixteenth through the nineteenth
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>.

[<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kolchin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Slavery</ENAMEX>: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1619-1877</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>.]
            

            However, the sentence could just as well have
appeared in a government report expressing an admonition
to keep the numbers secret, based on the
fact that numbers of such magnitude would anger the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slaves</ENAMEX>' descendents and on an assumed law to the effect
that sufficient provocation caused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebel</ENAMEX>.
Neither must itself nor the sentence as a whole provides
the slightest clue as to which of these inter pretation
is intended.  Only the context makes that clear.

            
               Should means the same as must , except that it
leaves room for loopholes that avoid the asserted necessity
in new or unusual circumstances.  For example,
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) progvide ways around the necessities
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)  asserts, on its reprective historical and admonitory
interpretations.



(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)  Although precise figures should remain elusive
(under normal circumstances), major new discoveries
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave-holders</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> and artifacts
will enable us to compute exact totals.

(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)  Although precise figures should remain elusive
(under normal circumstances), publishing the
figures in the current climate of suspicion will
clear the air, defuse anger, and enable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to
move on.
            

            
               Can is related to must in being what logicians
call its dual .  Whereas must says there are laws and
facts that necessitate some occurrence, can asserts
that whatever laws and facts there are, some occurrence
is permitted (or possible).  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> consequence of
this relation is the fact that though can and must have
very different meanings, cannot and must not are synonymous.
For example, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) has can where (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) has
must , but the meanings of their respective sentences
are the same.



(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>)  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larssen</ENAMEX>, you cannot let it get you down to
the point where it affects your work.  You can
not.

(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>)  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larssen</ENAMEX>, you must not let it get you down
to the point where it affects your work.  You
must not.
            

            Negating a sentence containing must keep the
necessity claim intact, negating only the verb, whereas
negating a sentence containing can keep the verb intact,
negating only the permission (or possibility).  To
say x cannot v is to say x must not-v.  To say x can
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> is to deny x must not-v.

            
               Justified is, in effect, a hybrid of must and can .
Like must , it asserts the existence of laws and facts,
but like can it expresses permission, rather than necessity.
To say that some action is justified is to say
there are laws and facts that permit it, whereas can expresses
permission for whatever laws and facts there
are.  To say that some action is not justified is to say
that the action is prohibited whatever the laws and
facts are.

            So to murder is to kill in a way that is prohibited
whatever the laws and facts are.  To deny that a killing
is murder is to claim there are laws and factsa that permit
it.  Those who cheered for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX>, instead
of calling him <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">murderer</ENAMEX>, based their judgment on
what they took to be a law regarding the sanctity of
national borders and on the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> had
violated such a border by invading a neighboring
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Thoses</ENAMEX> who cheered for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX>,
instead of calling him a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">murderer</ENAMEX>, based their judgment
on a law regarding the sovereignty of national
government and on what they took to be the fact
that the borders his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> had crossed were imposed
by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colonialists</ENAMEX> without the consent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>.

            
Obviously, none of this sheds any light at all on
which of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX>, if either, was correct.  It does help
to explain how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can talk past each other, using
the same words in the same language expressing the
same meanings, but interpreting those meanings in
relation to very different frameworks of concepts, beliefs,
expectations, and values.

of the then <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, he had sought to

(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 13, 1994</TIMEX>), the allegation was repeated and the article
further suggested that he might have had a corrupt connection

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travellers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">teh centuries</TIMEX> have always,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consciously</ENAMEX> or not, emphasized the deep division
existing between townsman and peasant, especially
reflected in the food eaten by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and the other.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasant</ENAMEX>'s fare always consisted basically of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bread â€” V.S. Pritchett</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marching Spain</ENAMEX> , a journey
made in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1928</TIMEX>, seems to have eaten nothing between
towns but hard <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> and the occasional doubtful
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>; although paying for it, little else could be offered
him.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> themselves often had nothing but
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> and coarse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>.  As the faced each
new day, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasant</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> thought was survival for
himself and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">another twenty-four hours</TIMEX>.
For them <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> was life.  Through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> popular
sayings grew up reflecting this obsession with that
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> food, applied to the daily philosophy of life.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singlish</ENAMEX>.  Sort of (but not really) single?  Contemplating
marriage or divorce?  Actually Singlish
has nothing to do with one's marital status.  It is the
system of writing that the victorious <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> wanted
to impose on the defeated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealanders</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> at the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>,
forcing them to abandon <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> letters and use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
logographs as phonetic equivalents of English words
instead.  As a foretaste of things to come to committee
responsible for implementing this innovation proffered
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singlish</ENAMEX> rendition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gettysburg</ENAMEX>
Address: (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">of er si guo er</ENAMEX>) Four score...

            Obviously, this plan never got off the ground.  How
could it?  Historical facts aside, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Singlish Affair</ENAMEX>
is the brain-child of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John DeFrancis</ENAMEX> ( The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
Language, Fact and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fantasy</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Univ</ENAMEX>. of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>), a
parodying bulesque pointing up certain features of languages
in general and of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> in particular.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Languages</ENAMEX>, though glibly spoken and written, often present
formidable problems of perception, both visual
and aural.  Thus fo <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">er si guo er</ENAMEX> , to all appearances
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, is actually pseudo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> nonsense.  Only
when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> realize its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Singlish â€”</ENAMEX> that is, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> masquerading
as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese â€”</ENAMEX> does it become intelligible.

            Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singlish</ENAMEX> is a figment of imagination,
there are many examples of genuine switched writing
systems masquerading as something they are not.  In
fact, trans-alphabetism, to coin an appropriate neolo-
gism, goes hand in hand with the history of writing.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> known graphic system, cuneiform, served as
the common vehicle of expression for not only
Sumerian, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Akkadian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Babylonian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assyrian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ugaritic</ENAMEX>,
but also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elamite</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hurrian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old Persian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hittite</ENAMEX>.
Much later, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> borrowed a foreign alphabet,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenician</ENAMEX> and adapted it to their needs.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> alphabet
was, in turn, used with modifications by the
Lykians, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lydians, Etruscans, Copts</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slavs</ENAMEX>.
Transformed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> alphabet, it
has since become the most widely used writing system
ever in the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX>.

            Alongside these examples of mainstream transalphabetism
are other lesser-known curiosities.  From
antiquity many such chameleonic switchovers are preserved
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">papyrus</TIMEX>, parchment, stone, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> and in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> letters serving to write <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Demotic Egyptian</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Babylonian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aramaic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>.
Conversely, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Demotic Egyptian</ENAMEX> signs and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Armenian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> letters were sometimes used to
write <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>.  Such trans-alphabetic texts are approximate
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">phonetic</ENAMEX> productions written by or for someone
interested in but not capable of reading a particular
language in its proper alphabet.  Thus, numerous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>-alphabetic glossariesâ€”Greek-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LatinGreek</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Coptic</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ArabicGreekâ</ENAMEX>€”once
thought to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolboys</ENAMEX>' exercises, are
probably elementary aids for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, pilgrims, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX>.  Even in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> it was
fashionable to write <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> texts employing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> letters,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> being a far more holy language than mundane
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin</ENAMEX>.  Yet in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> documents, notaries
appended their names and formulaic closing statements
using <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> letters.

            Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magicians</ENAMEX> deliberately wrote such
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>-alphabetic words and texts on amulets in order to
project an aura of mystery and impress a credulous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clientele</ENAMEX>.  Thus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> finds <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aramaic</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greek/Latin</ENAMEX>, and other languages disguised in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> letters.  Likewise, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> was written in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phonetic Coptic</ENAMEX>.

            Alongside these more pragmatic productions,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>-alphabetic texts are even found lurking in literature,
both ancient and modern.  In one of his comedies,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playwright</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plautus</ENAMEX> lets a character
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">declaim</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phoenician</ENAMEX> on stage.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plautus</ENAMEX> wrote the
text in phonetic <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mark 15.34</ENAMEX> records <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX>'s
reproach from the crossâ€” eloi, eloi, lamma sabachthani ?â€”
using <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> letters to transcribe the original
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aramaic</ENAMEX>.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1903</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> papyrus drama fragment
from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oxyrhyncus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>) was published in which an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> appears conversing in his mother tongue.  In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3rd-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCE</ENAMEX> papyrus preserving an unknown
language was found.  Both of these languages,
written in phonetic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, still await elucidation.
Another ancient oddity is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCE</ENAMEX> Aramaic
religious text in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Demotic</ENAMEX> script.

            Modern <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">translingual jeux d'esprit</ENAMEX> are Mots
d'Heures <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gousses Rames</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis d'Antin von Roote</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX>) in which <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> masquerades as
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brigid Brophy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">In Transit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>);
and the ultimate: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ulysses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finnegans Wake</ENAMEX>
with their ostensibly English yet polyvalent, transliteral
letter and word groups which punningly play over
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no fewer than fifty to sixty</NUMEX> languages in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cheshire-catlike</ENAMEX>,
now-you-see-it-now-you-don't trompes l'oeil .

            Apart from these curiosities are the many quite
standard instances of scripts serving to reproduce languages
with which they have no organic relationship
whatsoever.  <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle Persian</ENAMEX> (an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> language)
was written in a form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aramaic</ENAMEX> (a Semitic
language).  Modern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian</ENAMEX> is expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Semitic</ENAMEX>) letters.  Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Maltese</ENAMEX>, a bonafide <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Semitic</ENAMEX> language
is written not in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> but in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> letters.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>, which is neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semitic</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Indo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>,
was written using <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> letters until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1928</TIMEX>, when
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemal Ataturk</ENAMEX> decreed that it thenceforth be written
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> letters.  Other ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Turkic</ENAMEX> languages,
as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malayalam</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, were sometimes
written using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syriac</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Semitic</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle</ENAMEX>
High <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, more commonly known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>, is
written in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> letters, and, when similarly expressed
by means of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> letters, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> is called
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladino</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Asiatic</ENAMEX> languages were sometimes
written using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syriac</ENAMEX> letters.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Copts</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> originally
wrote their language (a derivative of pharaonic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> letters; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> they read their
prayers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> transcription.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> logographs
have been employed for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annamese</ENAMEX>.  However, present-day <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> uses
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> letters, as do many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Polynesian</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Micronesian</ENAMEX> languages around the world.  If the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ancient Romans</ENAMEX> were to meet up with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> letters in
modern central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micro</ENAMEX>- or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> would be
flummoxed for certain!

            That is not to mention the occasional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX> of

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">li</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> xocolatl chocolate).  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and Macau

of all-pervasive linguistic symbiosis on a daily
basis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singlish</ENAMEX> ubiquitous in the former, (e.g. ba shi

            I was saddened by the news of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney Greenbaum</ENAMEX>'s
death [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXIII,1</NUMEX>], and yet made less so somehow
by the thought that he died in the middle of what
he spent his life doing.  May we all be as fortunate.

            With regard to your review of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grammar</ENAMEX> , for me too, the traditional grammarians
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesperson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Curme, et al.</ENAMEX>, do it right.  They present us,
for our pleasure and edification, with the structures of
the language as found in the best of the corpus.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenbaum</ENAMEX>'s latest effort, on the other hand, wraps
an immense corpus of colloquial and formal speech
up in the respectable garb of grammatical explication,
leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> to have learned elsewhere which of
the examples should serve as a model when he invites
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> to dinner.  I take this to be not only silly
but potentially politically pernicious.

            In her delightful study, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Theories of Discourse</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diane Macdonell</ENAMEX> describes how after the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">French revolution</ENAMEX>
the bourgeois came to realize that, if the lower
orders took seriously the slogan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LibertÃ©</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EgalitÃ©</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FraternitÃ©</ENAMEX> , their wealth might fall into the hands of
the wrong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.  The solution to the problem was
straightforward.  Teach everyone <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> as if it were
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin</ENAMEX>.  The results were a working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> who could
read directions but not compose a well-formed composition
in their complicated native tongue, and an
educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> who got to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>, used French
as they had learned it at their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s knee (naturally,
not as they had been taught it in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>), and made
good use of the grammatical rules they had been
taught by applying them to their study of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>, a
nicely dead and therefore reasonably systematizable
language.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, who didn't go through the dislocation
(and revivification) of a revolution, simple allowed the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentry</ENAMEX> to establish the colloquial norm for those who
counted themselves among the educated, and mined
the literature for texts to constitute a canon that would
be taught as a stylistic and, as a by-product, grammatical
model.  The result was a respect for proper
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, that is to say the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> spoken by proper
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX>.  All a bit authoritarian, but reasonable.
The effectiveness of the policy can be seen by making
a quick analysis of the language spoken by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver</ENAMEX>
Twist: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX>, qua social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformer</ENAMEX>, knew perfectly
well that if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver</ENAMEX> hadn't somehow come to speak the
Queen's <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, he wouldn't have made it.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">One</ENAMEX>
might add in passing that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twentieth-century</TIMEX>, establishmentarian
feathers ruffled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D. H. Lawrence</ENAMEX>
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady Chatterley</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lover</ENAMEX> were less the result of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mellors</ENAMEX>' seducing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the aristocracy than
his not addressing her properly.)

            This latest trend, to make use of a vast corpus of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linguistic</ENAMEX> data as a way to democratize the understanding
of language isâ€”and I think here you and I
quite agreeâ€”a gross mistake.  Not only does it throw
out the concept of good <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, but it establishes
the norms of language on what's said.  (This is an expression
frequently used by my <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that in my opinion is as silly as basing a legal system
on what's done.)  Not long ago, when I suggestedâ€”for
a passage chosen for our entrance
examâ€”that an it that referred back to an unstipulated
topic of a previous paragraph, be changed to
this , I was told that there's no need to be so picky because
it's said.  The consequences of this (not it )
have not been such salutary effects as a broadening of
acceptable usage, or a loosening of the traditional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">schoolmaster</ENAMEX>'s authority over what constitutes proper
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, or a diminution of class consciousness.  The
resultsâ€”perhaps totally unforeseenâ€”have rather
been a shift in linguistic authority away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentry</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxbridgians</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>.

            The consequences of all this are fascinating.
We who are in control of the media and therefore
aware of the context in which unclear <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is used,
know what's going on (and therefore the meanings of
the utterances used to describe it), while the vulgar
(to use <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX>'s delightful expression for those with
a shaky grasp of vocabulary and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">syntax</ENAMEX> who are therefore
ill equipped to understand some particular bit
of newspeak) are led to believe, when they fail to
fathom what's going on, that the failure in comprehension
is entirely their fault.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenbaum</ENAMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grammar</ENAMEX> , with its democratic,
what's said, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">corpus</ENAMEX>-based approach to language, unwittingly,
I am quite sure, keeps the really proper use
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in the hands of those who are to the manner
born, while allowing the media moguls to interpret
or misinterpret the topics of public concern as
they will and at the same time disallowing the vulgar
from gaining a firm grasp on the means by which they
might enter the debate.  We have here a delightfully
constructed catch-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>: if you don't study your grammar
you're uneducated; if you do, you've been exposed to
a proper education by your kindly school system; but
when you use one of your grammar book's dreadfully
improper constructions as a model, you place
yourself in the class of the obviously simple-minded,
whose opinions are irrelevant.  And please notice:
when we use the word <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> here, we do so not at all
in a social senseâ€”oh dear me, noâ€”but strictly in an
intellectual one.  If you don't know the difference between
the appropriate contexts in which to use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> examples
placed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> after the other in your grammar
book, it's a consequence of your mind's incapacity to
grasp how things ought to be correctly expressed, not
that you've had the misfortune of being born into the
working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>.  (To what extent this is a conscious
agenda on the part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> and how
much it is simply an ill-conceived educational policy is
a matter for further inquiry.)

            Rather than focusing our attention on the establishment
of universally applicable rules of grammar as
a way to make a more democratic society, we might
better develop a more holistic, semiotically based curriculum
that points our young in the direction of clear
thinking.  I take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peirce</ENAMEX> to be right when he tells us
that meaning (and therefore correct usage in the
broadest sense) is always inseparable from context.
And given that fact, I would argue that as long as the
educational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> teaches dictionary definitions as
giving lexical meaning and grammatically proper
structures as carrying grammatically meaning, we will
have (as we do now) the vast bulk of our population
functionally illiterate.

            The subset of semiosis calledâ€”perhaps misleadinglyâ€” language
comes into being when there is a will
to share.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Searle</ENAMEX> would call it an intention.)  It works
when those involved share a common experience, a
common set of general rules for their communication
game, and a common aim for their dialogue.  It happens
best when the experience has the broadest possible
horizon, the rules are supplemented by good
style, and the aims are the achievement of the best
possible degree of understanding.  To give short shrift
to any of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> facets of communication is to
tear apart the fabric of dialogue.

            Too much buck-passing (usually in the name of
scientific rigor) between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> on language, literature,
and history has resulted in the sad fact that
clear thought, the mortar that serves to create integrated
human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interaction</ENAMEX>, has been quite consistently
assigned to the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>'s bailiwick.

            School systems teach systems.  But that can't be
the end of the matter.  The process that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bakhtin</ENAMEX> calls
Dialogue is ultimately context based and not system
based.  This is why, for example, the expression, The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> has it in for me, falls through the cracks of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lexicon</ENAMEX> and grammar.  The sentence doesn't mean
what the words mean, and if they did, why is the verb
have it in for defective?  I've never heard it used in
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, nor, one might add, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX> as
subject.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX> would learn <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> times more about
words and how they are used if, instead of being asked
to remember what is grammatically or lexically correct,
they were asked in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> to play roles such as
shoe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesmen</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lords</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">manor</ENAMEX> and by doing so
got a feel for what is said by such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in such dialoguesâ€”not
just what is said , but what is said in such
by such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> dialogues .  This kind of contextual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> (a sensitivity that is as yet not sufficiently
well understood) is far more important than that sort
of abstract knowledge of the proper use of language
that prompts certain of us to shiver at someone else's
stumbling over a shibboleth.  Needless to say, the idea
of abstract knowledge isn't all that simple.  How
much of what passes from Knowing grammar is in
fact remembering what was said at home or by an author
one has read?  Are grammatical rules explanations
of what is said by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like us?  If they are,
how does the learning of them help someone who
doesn't speak like us?  Does a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> learn to walk by
having the musculature of the legs explained to her?
(I add in passing a news bite heard between the writing
of this paragraph and its mailing: a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> was recently
given an award for innovative teaching.  He
received it because he has his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> write letters
taking the part, for example, of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Luther King</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jr.</ENAMEX>, and explaining his reasons for encouraging civilrights
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marches</ENAMEX>, a context in which repetition might
well be more frequent than in an essay by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bertrand</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell</ENAMEX>.  A correlate to this observation can be found
in the otherwise wise stylistic advice of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. B. White</ENAMEX>.
What grade would he have given the eloquent civilrights
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>?  And why?)

            I would argue that for survival in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty-first</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> will need an integrated course in
Peircean sem(e)iotics.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> in which an appreciation
of one's cultural context is combined with an
understanding of the suitable styles of dialogue
needed to express one's intentions.  A good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of an award-winning medical journal, received
his education in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> without
benefit of grammar book, but rather through the reading
and discussion, orally and in writing, of such works
as Catch-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> .  My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo Joshi Dai</ENAMEX> have
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">studied English</ENAMEX> grammar and memorized its vocabulary
for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">well over a half-dozen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, and when they
are asked if they can explain how to get to the train
station answer Yes, and stand by with a smile waiting
for the next question.  (And this should not be
construed as a lack of grammatical comprehension,
since, if they don't know the way, they invariably answer
I'm sorry.) Somehow, the proper understanding
of how we function semiotically (I'm trying to
avoid the word language for now) needs to be built
into any educational system by which succeeding generations
are taught the most effective way of sharing
human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">experienceâ</ENAMEX>€”both domestic and foreign.

            To get started on this major project I've been
looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Shapiro</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sense of Grammar:</ENAMEX>
Language as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semeiotic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>), and a rather
more interesting effort, one with which you may be
familiar, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Lord</ENAMEX>'s Words: A Hermeneutical
Approach to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Study of Language</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Press</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>), and would be most appreciative of
any suggestions on the work being done by those who
are having second thoughts about the use of that apparently
promising source of linguistic data known as
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corpus</ENAMEX>.




         
         

            I have immensense pleasure in renewing my subscription
to your wonderful periodical.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Schindler</ENAMEX>'s excellent article [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXIII,1</NUMEX>] probably
had no space to mention <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Polishâ€”a</ENAMEX> language
whose alphabet ends in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three zs</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">z, Åº , and z Polish</ENAMEX> appears
to be a difficult language to learn, but it has the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supreme</ENAMEX> advantage that every combination of letters
is always pronounced the same.  It is therefore possible
when meeting with a group of, say, pharmaceutical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chemists</ENAMEX>, to pick up a copy of their technical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journal</ENAMEX> lying on a table and impress them with your
grasp of their profession by reading an article out
loudâ€”without understanding a word of it.  Some
words you can guess at, of course.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purgative</ENAMEX> is czyszczacy â€”and just by looking at it you
can understand why.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura A. Macaluso</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPISTOLA</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXIII,1</NUMEX>] is not
strictly correct.  Beatles originated from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Silver</ENAMEX> Beetles
[ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ].  Whatever the subsequent connection with beat ,
the insect came first.  And talking about the naming of
things, their most famous song, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> , was originally
released on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LP</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> as an instrumental
with the title <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scrambled Eggs</ENAMEX> .  A Ph. D. thesis there
for some earnest young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academic</ENAMEX>!

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Some years ago</TIMEX>, travelling in luxury to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">train</ENAMEX>, we noticed considerable excitement being generated
by an attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> at the table opposite.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">riper years</TIMEX> asked especially
to be photographed with the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> for a family
album.  I asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waiter</ENAMEX> who he was.  Oh,
he fumbled, he eez <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronnie Modern</ENAMEX> .  I didn't recognise
the name but it told me everything.  A sensitive,
old-fashioned youth, failing to survive in the hurlyburly
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> popular music, eking out a living
crooning sentimental nostalgia to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> matrons on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> night <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club circuit</ENAMEX>.  I wondered how he
had scraped together the fare for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orient Express</ENAMEX>.
Perhaps he was doing the cabaret from the grand
piano after dinner and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> had scrounged him a
free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> in the contract.  Mix with the punters,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronnie</ENAMEX>, you'll get bigger tips that way .

            [Can anyone tell me the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> equivalent of punter?
It's not in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>.  Used disparagingly by
bookmakers of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, especially those placing
small bets.  By transference a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitute</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> or
the unknowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> of a minor confidence trick.]
Later, we shared a quiet bottle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laphroaig</ENAMEX> with this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">well-mannered</ENAMEX> and impeccably spoken paragon and
his beautiful young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>.  We learned that he was trying
to make a career as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> and that in the discipline
of fencing he had nearly made the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX>.
I asked where his name had come from.  His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>
looked puzzled, then light dawned.   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iron Maiden</ENAMEX> ,
she corrected me.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX> is the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX>.  I had an
immediate memory of a bare-chested <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-lout</ENAMEX>
backed by a wall of electronic Armageddon screaming
at me from a television and earning more dollars in an
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening than</TIMEX> there are greenfly on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">roses</ENAMEX>.  If it
ever gets out what he's really like, I remarked, he'll
never sell another record.

            Does anyone remember <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manfred Mann</ENAMEX>?  It is
the only instance I am aware of whereâ€”initially at
leastâ€”a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> was referred to collectively by the name
of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX>.  Compare: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
Lennon are...

            And in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early '60s</TIMEX>, in a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> hall in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Sussex</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, we danced to a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">amateurs</ENAMEX>
called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The High Numbers</ENAMEX> .  The who?  Yes, The
who .




         
         
            [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Punter</ENAMEX> is used to mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX>, chap, geezer,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>, but the most common <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> equivalent is probably
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX>, a deliberately ambiguous choice for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">senses</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>, as in cool <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customer</ENAMEX>, queer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> , etc.  As punt is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Briticism</ENAMEX> for gamble,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">punter</ENAMEX> in the sense of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gambler</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Briticism</ENAMEX>; there
are many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> equivalents, the most common being
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sucker</ENAMEX> .<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€”Editor</ENAMEX>]
         
         

            I read (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dia</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corner</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>] with great
interest but was perplexed by the examples at the top
of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> column on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, as I counted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
misprints at a first reading (Å“ for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ã¦</NUMEX>) and my feeling
was confirmed by checking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers Twentieth</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Century Dictionary</ENAMEX> .  In my memory and dictionary
we would spell the examples quoted as gynÃ¦cology,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hÃ¦matology</ENAMEX>, cÃ¦sium , and pÃ¦diatrics.  However,
in fiddling with my keyboard I discovered that the
italic form of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ã¦</NUMEX> (in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times New Roman</ENAMEX> at least) is almost
indistinguishable from Å“ except with a magnifying
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glassâ€”thus; Å“</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Ã¦ â</ENAMEX>€”so I can only assume you
have been thwarted by a quirk of the computer!

            In the paragraph at the foot of this column, one
might have expected to see diÃ¦resis in place of diaeresis,
but at least the unligated form does not lead

I realized eventually that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welsh</ENAMEX> vowel
and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWY</ENAMEX> should be pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHOOey</ENAMEX>.
Anyone who has travelled on a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> FWY
would probably agree that this is a very appropriate
designation.

            It has long been a source of puzzlement to me

            The phenomenon of names matching professions
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPISTOLAE</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXII,4</NUMEX>] has been the subject of much discussion
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientist</ENAMEX> , where it is termed nominative determinism .
However, my <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two favourite</NUMEX> examples have not appeared
in the pages of that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>: an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Trust</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ornithology</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sue Starling</ENAMEX> ,

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ichinose</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sneeze</ENAMEX> .



         
         

            As a once occasional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>, I am
overpowered by an itch to comment on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emanuel</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Straussâ€s</ENAMEX> review of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Mertvago</ENAMEX>'s Comparative
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Russian-English Dictionary of Russian Proverbs</ENAMEX> &
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sayings</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXIII,3</NUMEX>].  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of observations in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX>, whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strauss</ENAMEX>'s or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mertvago's</ENAMEX>, strike me as
dubious at best and the translation of an example as
misleading.

            I do not agree that the relative brevity of many
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian proverbs</ENAMEX> stems from the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
language has no articles and also resorts idiomatically
to participial condensation by not using oblique
forms of the verb to be.  What about byvshii having
been and budushchii , the future participle of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">verb</ENAMEX> for to be?  No, the form of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
verb for to be that is usually (but not always) omitted
is the present tense, as sometimes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terrific</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guy</ENAMEX>, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX>!  This omission and the absence of articles
does lend a certain pithiness to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proverbs</ENAMEX>.  But I think that the apparent brevity, which
depends in part on whether you count words or syllables,
is due much more to the heavy inflection of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> that compresses meaning in single words.
The best example of this kind of semantic compression
that occurs to me is from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>, a language that
in many respects is grammatically similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>:
Romae romane , which comes to us in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as
When in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, do as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romans</ENAMEX> do.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian I</ENAMEX>
can squeeze this down to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V Ryme-po-</ENAMEX>rymski .  But
then in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> one can come pretty close to both
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> meaning and brevity with, say, In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>,
act (or be) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX>.  Running <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English proverbs</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sayings</ENAMEX> through my mind, I seem to find that although
our language has the resources to be fairly pithy, we
are not as attracted to pithiness as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX>.

            What bothers me more, however, is the translation
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proverb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chemu Vanya nye</ENAMEX> nauchilsya,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tovo Ivan nye</ENAMEX> vyuchit .  Literally, leaving out
the tovo as redundant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, this proverb means
What <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnnie</ENAMEX> hasn't learnt, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> won't learn.  Just as
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> the nickname <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Johnnie</ENAMEX> implies youth, so
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> nickname <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vanya</ENAMEX> implies boyhoodâ€”but
only implies: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Vanya</ENAMEX> was not youngâ€”while the
formal names <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John/Ivan</ENAMEX> imply maturity.  By overloading
the proverb with little and old in What
little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Johnnie</ENAMEX> hasn't learnt, old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> will not learn,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX> (here a traditore, indeed) has killed the
clever implication inherent in the play on names, perhaps
in a fumbled attempt to bear out his claim that
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Russian proverbs</ENAMEX> are relatively brief.

            Maybe I am nitpicking, though.  The statement
that Generally speaking, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> make greater
use of proverbs than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> is
doubtless true, with the consequence that the careful
attention given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mertvago</ENAMEX>'s compilation is quite justified.

            As for me, I hope that my nitpicking through the
articles you publish in VERBATIM demonstrates the
consideration I think due these articles rather than
envy and pedantry.



         
         

            I found the following article by my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter W. Skeat</ENAMEX>, among some of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>.
The justification for reprinting it would be that
although I find his explanation totally convincing, it is
not to be found either in the original edition of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> under the word dear , to which he refers, or in
the revised edition published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>.



         
         

            
               OH!  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DEAR</ENAMEX>!
            

            It must have struck many that the very common phrase
Oh! dear is, after all, a very senseless expression.  When we
come to try to read sense into it, some might think that it
may be contracted from some longer expression, such as
Oh! dear me.  But this is not in accordance with the evidence.
The earliest known example of Dear me is no
older than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1773</TIMEX>, whilst Oh dear occurs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 1694</TIMEX>,
and is the earliest known phrase in which dear occurs at all.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray</ENAMEX> remarks [in Volume <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1897</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">s.</ENAMEX>v. dear] that several phrases occur,
such as dear save us in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1719</TIMEX>, dear knows in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1876</TIMEX>, dear
help you in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1880</TIMEX>, and the like, which suggest that dear
represents or implies a fuller dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lord</ENAMEX> ; thus dear knows
is equivalent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lord</ENAMEX> knows, and so on.  But he adds,
very justly, that a derivation from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ital</ENAMEX>.  Dio , God, resting
upon the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> pronunciation of dear , finds no
support in the history of the word.

            I wish to draw attention to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ascertained facts.  The
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is that the particular phrase Oh dear!  is the earliest of
the set, as has been already remarked; and secondly, that
there is no trace whatever, even in dialects, of a fuller form
like dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lord</ENAMEX>.  If we are to go by the evidence, we must
recognise that the interpretation of dear by dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lord</ENAMEX> or
even by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> at all, is due to the influence of popular etymology,
which could make nothing of dear when it stood
alone.

            I think it is equally clear that we must dismiss all
thoughts of connecting its origin with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> Dio .

            I will now go a step further, and assert that there is no
evidence whatever for connecting it with the adjective dear
at all!  It makes no sense, as we may see by a little thought.
For dear means beloved, affectionate, precious, and the
like; but the exclamation Oh! dear!  is one that denotes
something very different, something that is lamentable or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calamitous</ENAMEX>, and very far from being pleasant.  Thus, in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1694</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congreve</ENAMEX> makes one of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> sayâ€”Oh! dear!
you make me blush!  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1769</TIMEX> we findâ€”Oh dear! oh dear!
how melancholy, has been to me this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>!  And againâ€”
Oh! dear!  I shall die!  And in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldsmith</ENAMEX>'s She <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoops</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conquer</ENAMEX> , Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardcastle</ENAMEX> saysâ€”Dear me!  Dear me!  I'm
sure there's nothing in my behaviour to put me on a level
with one of that stamp.

            If we will only, for a moment, consider this probability,
viz. that there is no good reason for associating this interjectional
phrase with a well-known adjective, this will leave
us free to look around us, and see whether any other source
is possible.

            And if we do this, we have not to look far.  The phrase,
for instance, makes no good sense in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>; and this affords
a presumption that it was borrowed from abroad.
And whenever we consider the possibility of borrowing at
the end of the seventeenth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>, our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> thoughts turn,
as a matter of course, to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>.  Let us see what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
will do for us.

            I now venture to quote some remarkable words from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cotgrave</ENAMEX>'s well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>, and from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old French</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary by Godefroy</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cotgrave</ENAMEX> has:â€” <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DeÃ¢</ENAMEX> , an interjection, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DÃ¢</ENAMEX>, ouy de^
[the circumflex over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">a</ENAMEX> is not mine, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cotgrave</ENAMEX>'s], yes,
truly, verily, without doubt also, a tearme of expostulation
[note this]; as deÃ¢, qui vous mouvoit ?  why, or good God,
what reason had you?  or what, a God's name, moved you?

            It should particularly be remarked that the sense coincides
exactly with that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> phrase.  We can translate
this literally by sayingâ€”Dear, dear! who put you up to
it?  It is a note of expostulation, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cotgrave</ENAMEX> truly says; and
it indicates despair rather than hope.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godefroy</ENAMEX> has:â€” <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dea</ENAMEX>, dia, dya, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da</ENAMEX> , a sort of exclamation
of astonishment.  His examples show that it was sometimes
preceded by the interjection he [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">illegible character</ENAMEX>] as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HÃ©</ENAMEX>,
dia! or HÃ©! <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dea</ENAMEX> , which is suggestive of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> phrase.
It was usually employed, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, to imply lamentation
or disaster, as, e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HÃ©</ENAMEX>, dea! quand <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">je fus nÃ© quelle</ENAMEX> mauditte
estoille presida dessus moy; i.e.  Oh! dear! what an evil star
presided over my birth.   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dea</ENAMEX>! quel desastre <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">est</TIMEX> ce qui
regne en <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>! i.e. Dear! what a disaster prevails in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>!  It served also, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cotgrave</ENAMEX> notes, to enforce an affirmation,
as in  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ouy</ENAMEX> dea , dis je; Yes, forsooth, say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX>

            It is worth while trying to guess whence this expression
came.  We notice that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cotgrave</ENAMEX> writes it with a circumflex
over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a</TIMEX> , as if it were a contracted form.  It is remarkable
that the chief word which in Old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> began with dea- or
dia - is the too common word deable or diable , the use of
which in expressions of lamentation is so prevalent both in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  It really seems as if the true sense of
Oh dear! were Oh! the devil!  The clipping of swearwords
is a common phenomenon.  If this be so, the exclamation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear</ENAMEX> knows may have originated in a phrase which
meant the devil knows.  But as this interpretation was not
at all obvious, or was forgotten, the familiarity of many
Englishmen with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Span</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dios</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ital</ENAMEX>.  Dio may really
have suggested a new interpretation in the eighteenth
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>; indeed, even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cotgrave</ENAMEX> seems to have had such a
notion.  For the earliest example of Dear save us is no
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier than 1719</TIMEX>; whilst, on the other hand, the use of dea
occurs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rabelais</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Godefroy</ENAMEX>, in his supplement, quotes
the phrase  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dya</ENAMEX>, dya , houoih, hau dia, i.e . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear</ENAMEX>, dear!
houoih, Oh dear! from a book dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1561</TIMEX>.

            This <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.F. dea</ENAMEX> , later dia , seems to be modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F. da</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.F. disva</ENAMEX>, diva, i.e. come along, is clearly quite a
different word.

            Finally, we may notice that the double form dea, dia ,
will suit either the old or the modern pronunciation of the
English dear , so that phonetic requirements are fulfilled
either way.

square of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX> = (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.6</NUMEX>)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30.25</NUMEX>.

         
         

            Contradiction in Terms



            Given that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language is the world's
principal form of communication, we can perhaps be
forgiven for tripping ourselves up with it occasionally.
We are particularly good at contradicting ourselvesâ€”
so good, in fact, we do it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>, assuming that other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't beat us to it.

            I can recall the time I bought some terracotta
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX> containing scented candles, which I was instructed
to place on a dining table during a meal, or in
any <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> I wished.  The scent would repel all biting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> in the area.  When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX> arrived, a footnote
on the instructions informed me they were for outdoor
use only.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Newspapers</ENAMEX> are extremely good at bringing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s
contradictions to a wide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>.  Consider the
memorable statement made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Â¥1</NUMEX>.5
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> winning pools <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">syndicate</ENAMEX>.  They had filled in
their coupon while drinking to celebrate a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Â¥20</NUMEX> win.
When they won the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> said, It's great.
We've never won anything before.  Granted, the effects
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> might have been responsible for that
confusing statement.  I have yet to find an excuse for
these next examples.

            I have seen plastic-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">lidded</NUMEX> containers which are
completely safe to use in the microwaveâ€”so long as
you don't use the lid; all manner of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX> instructing
you to take two every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> hoursâ€”but no more than
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> in any <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty-four hour</TIMEX> period; and a notice by
school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bosses</ENAMEX> who were determined to improve the
poor standard of spelling on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isle of White</ENAMEX> .

            So, contradictions are rife.  And I am unanimous
in that.

         
         
            The Internet is quickly becoming a fixtureâ€”however
mobile it might seemâ€”of modern life.  We have

            Future to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Back</ENAMEX>





            Whatever happened to the word back ?  I feel as
if I have been transferred back to the future, or
should I say future to the back?  I look back to yesterday
and ahead to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>, but recently the
meaning of back seems to have reversed behind my
back.  Back is often now used to mean forward.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictionaries</ENAMEX> show no such change.  The adverb back
still means in, to, or toward a past time, and the adjective
back is still defined as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a past date</TIMEX>; not current;
but I continually find examples of backward
writing.

            In an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Press</ENAMEX> story:



The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> put off a major exhibit on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sigmund Freud</ENAMEX> and promptly found itself on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couch</ENAMEX>....  The show was pushed back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1997</TIMEX>
and possibly later.
            

            In a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Providence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> story about a person considering
a new job:



The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> said he would do it only if he
could push back the starting time until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11am</TIMEX> instead
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>.
            

            In one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of articles about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O. J. Simpson</ENAMEX>, in
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ito</ENAMEX> was quoted as saying,
in response to a request that the trial date be moved
ahead, that



[I]t was too late to move the date back.
            

            Reverse news from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> :



<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Weather Service</ENAMEX> renewed its prediction for
a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32.5</NUMEX> foot crest, but put it back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another day</TIMEX>, to
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>.  It just kept coming at us like a bouncing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ball</ENAMEX>.
            

            A backward bouncing ball?

            From <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry McMurtrey</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lonesome Dove :</ENAMEX>



He hurried to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Rosa</ENAMEX>, risking further damage to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon</ENAMEX>, only to discover that the hanging had
been put back a week.
            

            More <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Providence Journal</ENAMEX> back talk:



The hearing had been scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, then
pushed back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawmakers</ENAMEX> pushed back from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 1 to Nov. 1</TIMEX> the
effective date of a law requiring all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motorists</ENAMEX> to carry
liability insurance.
            

            A possible theory for reversing the meaning of
back is that the sense is further [back] in the schedule,
not further back in time; but a usage such as the
following in a published television schedule for 8pm
may negate this argument:



Looking for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Roseanne</ENAMEX>?  You'll have to wait until
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> pushed the program back <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 minutes</TIMEX>.
            

            I sent pages of examples to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Edition</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX> .  They replied that
my evidence



...is filed for the attention of our new words <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>.
If they find that we have accumulated a number
of examples of back in this sense in our files and
on our databases then it will be considered for drafting
as an established usage.
            

         
         

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calendrical Sentence</ENAMEX>




            Many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> I came across a meaningful sentence
attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rabindranath Tagore</ENAMEX>, the only
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> to win the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Prize:</ENAMEX>


Worship God and attain a soul devoid of anger, passion,
and guilt.
            

            Memorize this sentence, because it is not only meaningful
but also useful in that it will enable <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to find
out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of any date except in leap <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.

            The sentence has twelve words.  Each word is
connected with each month, respectively, that is, worship
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>, God for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>, and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>,
and so on.  Here is the method to apply in finding the
day of any date of any year except leap <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leap</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> are easy to identify: they are any year divisible by
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 and centuries</TIMEX> divisible by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>: thus, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> will be a
leap year, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX> was not.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> became independent on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 August 1947</TIMEX>.

            To find <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day of the week</TIMEX> on which that date
fell, first divide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</TIMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>: the answer is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">486</NUMEX> (with a
remainder of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, which should be ignored); add this
number: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1947</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">486</NUMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2433</TIMEX> .  Then find the word
that stands for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX> monthâ€” of â€”and
add the number of its letters: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> + <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2433</TIMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2435</TIMEX>.
Now add the date sought: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2435</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2450</TIMEX>.
Divide this number by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2450 Ã· 7</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> remainder.
            

            
Now, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days of the week</TIMEX> are numbered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6,</ENAMEX>
beginning with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>; 2
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">=</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>;
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6</TIMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>.
            

            Ergo, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Independence Day</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 August 1947</TIMEX>, fell
on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>.

            Take another example: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V-E Day</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1945</TIMEX>:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1945 Ã· 4</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">486</NUMEX> (+ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
            

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">486</NUMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2431</TIMEX>.
            

            
               May = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">A</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> + <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2431</TIMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2432</TIMEX>.
            

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2432</TIMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2440</TIMEX>.
            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2440 Ã· 7</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">348</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
            

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>.
            

            And a final <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> was shot, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1865</TIMEX>:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1865 Ã· 4</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">466</NUMEX> (+ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
            

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1865</TIMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">466</NUMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2331</TIMEX>.
            

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> = attain = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> + <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2331</TIMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2337</TIMEX>.
            

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2337</TIMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2351</TIMEX>.
            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2351 / 7</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">335</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>.
            

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6</TIMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>.
            

         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iffy Sentences</ENAMEX>




            I won't be home till <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later tonight</TIMEX>, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> in the sit-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">com</ENAMEX>.  If you get hungry, there's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ham</ENAMEX> in the fridge.

            I have always wanted to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> in that
scenario so I could snap back, Oh, really?  And
where's the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> if I don't get hungry?

            Similarly: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> is going to leave for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vacation</TIMEX>,
and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last day</TIMEX> at work, a coworker
remarks, If I don't see you again before I
leave, have a great trip!

            Oh, yeah?  I make her reply.  And what kind of
trip should I have if I do see you before I leave?

            I call these situations iffy sentences , whose if-then
logic doesn't quite work.  Syntactically speaking, the
apodosis, or consequence, is not linked to the protasis,
or condition, and this causes semantic confusion.
That is, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> is in the fridge no matter what the
state of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s stomach, and a last possible
meeting has nothing to do with the well-wisher's kind
hope.  In each case, the conclusion should stand
whether or not the premise is fulfilled.  Of course,
someone may note, If you think about them, they
do make sense.  And what if you don't think about
them?  Do they recede into nonsense?

            The truth is that these sentences are really just elliptical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constructions</ENAMEX>.  Fully expanded versions of the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> might read, albeit clunkily, You should know,
if you get hungry, that there's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> in the fridge.
Since I may not see you before I leave, let me wish
you a great trip right now!

            Anyone who keeps an open ear can add to the list
of iffy sentences.  If you don't mind, I have to go is
another example in my growing collection, along with
If you speak to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>, I'm sick <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.  Quibbling
over such syntax may seem trivial, but language is so
often a dormant phenomenon that it is worth tweaking
its tail on occasion.  And those who are alive to
such nuances often get better results from their
queries.  As I once heard a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> asking a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> out
on a date, If you're interested, just let me know.  But
let me know if you're not interested, too.

            She suddenly looked interested.

         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Game</ENAMEX> of the Name



            Being born of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> Midlands
and spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early years</TIMEX> of my life there, having
a name like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Thorpe</ENAMEX> never really gave me any
problems.  The countryside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lincolnshire</ENAMEX> and Leicestershire
abounds with village names that end with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thorpe</ENAMEX> and, apart from being called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thorpy</ENAMEX> by my
school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pals</ENAMEX>, the name never caused any difficulty.
That was before I started travelling.  It was then that
I found out just how tough it is for most nationalities
to get their tongues round the dreaded <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">th</NUMEX> .  Even
when I started working in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> I had to accept a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fair</ENAMEX> number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mista Forps</ENAMEX> in the course of an average
day.

            It is not surprising that my first exposure to non-Brits
was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, where I soon reconciled myself to
a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gallic</ENAMEX> attack on my personal hygiene when they insisted
on addressing me as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miss</ENAMEX> Your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soap</ENAMEX>, subtly
intoned, I always thought, with an interrogatory inflexion.
Later, on many visits to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, I reluctantly
submitted to the title of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hair Torpor</ENAMEX>, an
uncanny prediction of what was to befall my then luxuriant
growth.  Italians mostly managed with a cheerful
Seen <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Your Top</ENAMEX>, which surprised me because I
was taller than most of those I had to deal with.  My
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact</ENAMEX> used to call me simply <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zorrp</ENAMEX>, which
I found pretty much to the point, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungarian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> settled for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trope</ENAMEX>.  Only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX>
did I find someone who truly tried to get it right, but
the effort involved putting his tongue out at me and
concluded with an overly explosive final consonant;
but he got all the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> in there.

            My travels in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> demonstrate a much more sensible
approach by the wily <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX>, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> most of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> have, without
invitation, settled for the easy to deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mister</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>.

            Strange to say, it is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> that one of the really
weird aural hiccups occurs.  It usually happens in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> or any of the other places where
professional name <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">takers</ENAMEX> are found.  The conversation
usually goes something like this:



Good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, sir.  Could I have your name
please?

Yes, I'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Thorpe</ENAMEX>.

OK, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philips</ENAMEX>, I've put your name on the list.

No, no.  My name is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thorpe</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thorpe</ENAMEX>.

Oh!  Sari!  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yewer Jarn Thorwup</ENAMEX>.  Gee, I'm sari.
            

            Now that conversation may sound unbelievable,
but in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> I have been renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX> dozens
of times, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> coast, particularly.  So often, in
fact, that I have been forced to assume the new identity
of the more acceptable <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarn Thorwup</ENAMEX> when
dealing with any of the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">takers</ENAMEX> so deeply entrenched
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> way of doing things.  How
can they hear it that way?  It is not as though Thorpe
is that unusual a name in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>: after all, one of
the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> of all time was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Thorpe</ENAMEX>, and
they even named a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> after him.  To be honest
though, I think I would rather be a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zorrp</ENAMEX> than a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX>.

            The language of the Internet is visual, produced
on a screen and printoutable.  Still, for all their delight
in browsing and surfing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">netizens</ENAMEX> seem to prefer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chatting</ENAMEX>, personal and intimate communication.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatting</ENAMEX> has restraints, of course, in a network of burgeoning
traffic and explosive costs.  If chatting is
friendly and informal, it must also be brief and pungent.
Derived to a large extent from pop culture
comic strips, science fiction, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVâ</ENAMEX>€”the jargon of the superhighway
is larger than life, bold if not simplistic,
and not without a certain intellectual mischievousness.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Highlighting</ENAMEX> is a natural and favored component,
as in the fondness for abbreviations, acronyms,
capital letters, telescoping, emoticons, interjections,
and other striking visual devices, not to mention their
frequently slangy ( plunk I just put you in my killfile)
or vulgar ( RTFM Read the fucking manual) content,
as well as onomatopoeic renditions ( bang common
spoken name for !).

            Although the Internet is international, its jargon
is a subspecies of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX>.  It is a melange,
to be sure, but given the technological nature of the
medium, its roots and contours are clearly definable.
It is a product of the east and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">west</ENAMEX> coasts of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>, its poles being <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berkeley</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>.  A detailed profile is not
necessary here, but one element is of interest as a
further device of highlighting: ethnicity.  In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>,
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jargon File</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Version 2.9.6</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 August 1991</TIMEX>) asserts
(not without a certain telling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">naively</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hacker</ENAMEX>-dom
is predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Caucasian</ENAMEX> with strong
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orientals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast</ENAMEX>).  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> contingent has exerted a particularly
pervasive cultural influence (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food</ENAMEX>, above
[where available, high-quality <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> delicatessen
food is much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">esteemed</ENAMEX>], and note that several common
jargon terms are obviously mutated <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>.
Leaving aside such fully assimilated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> words
as pretzel and strudel (and the fact that new meanings
have been attached to them), the mutated <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>
terms represent, for one thing, the only discernible
ethnic orientation in the vocabulary and are thus by
their very appearance a form of highlighting.  They
stand out.  For another thing, they are generally emotiveâ€”onomatopoeic
expressions communicating dissatisfaction
or disgust.

            Among those listed and defined (albeit not always
accurate in explanations) in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Jargon File are</ENAMEX>



<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bletch</ENAMEX> [from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> brechen to vomit,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poss</ENAMEX>. via comic-strip exclamation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">blech</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">interj</ENAMEX>.
Term of disgust.  Often used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ugh</ENAMEX>, bletch.  (Also
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bletcherous Disgusting</ENAMEX> in design or function; esthetically
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unappealing</ENAMEX>.)

Deliberate distortion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DECNET</ENAMEX>, a networking
protocol used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">{VMS</ENAMEX>} community.  So called
because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEC</ENAMEX> helped write the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethernet</ENAMEX> specification
and then (either stupidly or as a malignant customer-control
tactic) violated that spec in the design
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRECNET</ENAMEX> in a way that made it incompatible.

foo interj.  Term of disgust... Very probably, hackish
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foo</ENAMEX> had no single origin and derives from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">feh</ENAMEX> and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> fooey.

glitch [from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> glitschen to slip, via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yiddish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glitshen</ENAMEX> to slide or skid] n.  A sudden interruption in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electric</ENAMEX> service, sanity, continuity, or program function.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gonk</ENAMEX> v.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">t.</ENAMEX>, n.  To prevaricate or to embellish the

that in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> the term is (mythically)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gonken</ENAMEX>... You're gonking me.  That story you just

            It would be going too far to suggest an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Semitic</ENAMEX>
stance (despite the implications of not including <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>
among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasians</ENAMEX>).  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Undeniable</ENAMEX> is the grossly comic
intention and effect, doubtless a reflection of pop culture's
infatuation with the sputtering, guttural, goofy
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> (rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>) sounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TV</ENAMEX>'s Stalag

            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Yankee Talk: A Dictionary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Expressions</ENAMEX>
            Dialects are subject of popular interest, especially
quaint ones like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennsylvania Dutch</ENAMEX> or many dialects
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX>.  Treatments of
such dialects appropriate for the popular market cannot
be technical, but neither should they be inaccurate.
It is after all possible to be both informative and
interesting.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankee Talk</ENAMEX> works hard at being both, but
succeeds better at the second aim than the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, giving
out a passel (indefinite number) of entertainment
and a gorm (gooey mess) of misinformation.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">misinformation</ENAMEX> begins in the introduction
[v], where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> acknowledges among his sources
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitford M. Mathews</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The American Dialect Dictionary</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Dictionary of Americanisms</ENAMEX> .  Only
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> of those works is by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mathews</ENAMEX>; the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Wentworth</ENAMEX>.

            The work is also generous in what it considers to
be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX> expressions.  Anything quaint found in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX> is fair game, regardless of where else it
may occur.  For example, each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tub</ENAMEX> must stand on its
own bottom is said to be an old proverb stressing New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX> self-reliance, but <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Dictionary of American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proverbs</ENAMEX> documents its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">distribution</ENAMEX> throughout the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chat</ENAMEX> gets an entry as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX> expression,
with a citation from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman Melville</ENAMEX> boasting, By
our immortal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill of Rights</ENAMEX>, that guarantees to us liberty
of speech, chat we <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankees</ENAMEX> will.  Never mind
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX> documents the
word's use since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifteenth century</TIMEX> or that it is familiar
all over the English-speaking world.

            
               Chock full and church supper also have entries.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is attested in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 1400</TIMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is the sort of free combination that can
and does occur anywhere.  Both are standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>,
neither being a specifically <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX> expression.
Other standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> words mislisted as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX>
words are package store a store selling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> by
the bottle for consumption elsewhere, pshaw! an exclamation
archaic everywhere, sheers sheer curtains,
and verandah .

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verandah</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hindi</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bengali</ENAMEX>,
which got it from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX>.  It is apparently included
here because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edith Wharton</ENAMEX> used it (at least
the entry includes a quotation from her) or because
some <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> have verandahs.  But on
either of the same grounds, window and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX> could
be listed as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX> expressions.

            Folk etymology is favored in this dictionary.  The
entry for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anadama bread</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Englandism</ENAMEX> whose
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">origin</ENAMEX> is unknown, is devoted to variants on the following
tale:



Tradition has it that a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yankee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> or fisherman,
whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna</ENAMEX> was too lazy to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> for him, concocted
the recipe.  On tasting the result of his [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX>]
efforts, a neighbor asked him what he called the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>.  The crusty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankee</ENAMEX> replied, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna</ENAMEX>, damn her!
            

            There are other genuine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX> expressions
in this volumeâ€”and plenty of themâ€”including
dingclicker humdinger, forth-putting bold, forward,
grouty surly, sullen, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hampton</ENAMEX> boat a dory-type of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sailboat</ENAMEX> used for fishing, and harness cask a tub used
on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> for storing salted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>.  All of these can also
be found in the best dictionary of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> dialects:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederic G. Cassidy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Houston Hall</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Regional English</ENAMEX> , including, as it happens,
the same illustrative quotations used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankee</ENAMEX>
Talk plus some additional ones.

            There are also occasional, perhaps disingenuous,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">puzzles</ENAMEX>.  The entry for chism , for instance, which
reads in full, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heard</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gravy</ENAMEX> or cream
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX>.  It would be useful to give a bit more information
for the guidance of the innocent and unwary:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chism</ENAMEX> is a variant of the vulgar slang term jism or gism
for semen, so in the reported use is an indelicate
metaphor.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX> should be
warned that in a Bangor restaurant they ought not
ask for chism with their roast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX>.

            The problem with this book is knowing which entries
are genuine and which spurious.  To make that
discrimination, another more reliable work like the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictionary of American Regional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> needs to be
consulted.  So the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> might as well go to the better
source in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place, thus confirming <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parker</ENAMEX>'s critical recommendation (slightly paraphrased):
This is not a book to be tossed aside lightly.  It should be
thrown with great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robertson Cochrane</ENAMEX>, whose articles on language in

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">persuaded Bob</ENAMEX> to write for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>.  His lively,
friendly, perceptive, well-written column appeared
several times under the heading he chose, VERBUM
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAP</ENAMEX>.  We finally met in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, when we had lunch together
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falls</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, he succumbed shortly
thereafter.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> of the articles reprinted here are from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>, and that speaks for the high esteem I have
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bob</ENAMEX>'s writing.  Moreover, I provided the Foreword
to Wordplay .  Perhaps I may be allowed to quote
from that:



It is... an unalloyed delight to see

...[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>]riting well is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only half</NUMEX> the task; one
must also have something to say.  Owing to the vastness
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language, it is impossible to believe
that one would run out of things to say about its
myriad aspects.  Indeed, the scholarly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> have
been overflowing with turgid prose for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, and
it is particularly refreshing to know that comment on
virtually any aspect of language can still be offered in
language that, glowing with respectability, cleaving to
the well-turned phrase, punctuated by the provocative
pun, can be so engagingly presented.
