            What happens when power <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">users</ENAMEX> dump baudy
language ?  Should they abort, retry, ignore ,
or admit failure?  They might boot up again, but they
could experience a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> crash .  Would Kermit prevent
them from being munged ?  What should a poor
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technoweenie</ENAMEX> do when threatened by thrashing between
disk and memory?  Nerdettes better hope their
motherboards are user-friendly .  If all else fails, they
could hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DWIM</ENAMEX> key.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hackers</ENAMEX> , or just plain droupies , probably have
no trouble translating what I just wrote out of computer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jargon</ENAMEX> and slang into more conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>.
But even if you do not understand the preceding,
you probably feel the tension between words
conveying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, strength, and menace, such as
power <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, abort, dump, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> crash , and munged ,
with words suggesting vulnerability, frailty, and humor
as a defense against such powerlessness, in
words like technoweenie, nerdettes, user-friendly ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DWIM</ENAMEX> (for do what I mean, a mythological key
that would make the computer do what you cannot
figure out yourself).

            Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who use computers feel ambivalent
about them.  It should not, therefore, be surprising
that computer slang conveys divided, and sometimes
radically conflicting feelings.  As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">librarian</ENAMEX> I see evidence
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> of this ambivalence in the slang
used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slang</ENAMEX> is a reliable
gauge of attitudes because it is usually used in an
unguarded way to express unedited feelings.

            I am using the word slang as it is defined on
page xi in the latest scholarly <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary of American</ENAMEX>
slang, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.E. Lighter</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Dictionary of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Slang</ENAMEX> , Volume I, A-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>): an informal,
nonsubstandard, nontechnical vocabulary composed
chiefly of novel-sounding synonyms for standard
words and phrases.  I am assuming, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of
this dictionary argues, that slang is not just colloquial
language, but that it is often aggressively informal,
that it doesn't tolerate pretense, that it is often
crude, blunt, ribald, egalitarian--in short, very unpretentious
and honest language.  [ ibid , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">xii</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slang</ENAMEX> is similar to, but rather different from
computer jargon, which is the specialized language
used by tekkies.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jargon</ENAMEX> is the in language used
by any profession, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, or class.  The word default
is jargon for something automatically carried out
unless you change it.  This term does not qualify as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slang</ENAMEX> because it is a legitimate, formal term, rather
easy to define denotatively, quite fit for use in polite
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, and equally at home in written and spoken
language.  By contrast, the neologism droupie a person
who likes to spend time in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> of programmers
and data processing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>, is slang
because it is very informal language.  In fact, it is so
casual as to suggest an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-grown-up</ENAMEX> rebelliousness
because of its probable derivation from the word
groupie , and it is definitely more frequent in speech
than in writing.

            Because slang is up front and sometimes deliberately
in your face language, we can learn
more about how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> really feel about computers
by examining slang rather than jargon.  A good way
to remember the difference between slang and jargon
is that jargon serves to indicate a referent, usually
with great precision, while slang characterizes
and often makes light of what is referred to, and
nonslang synonyms are almost always readily available.
Technical language develops among specialists
for the purpose of cooperation; slang develops
among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> for purposes of expressiveness,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companionability</ENAMEX> and to some extent exclusivity.
[ ibid . xvi-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">xvii</ENAMEX>]

            We can learn a lot about what is on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s
minds when we analyze jargon, but we can learn
how they feel when we analyze slang.  Thus, it is not
surprising that a great deal of computer jargon is a
quick way to say otherwise complicated things.  For
example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIPS</ENAMEX> is a convenient acronym for millions
of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">instructions per second</NUMEX>, point and click is a quick
and direct way of describing basic mouse techniques,
and run-around , borrowed from typesetting,
is an apt metaphor for the way text flows around the
outside edges of a graphic image.  Jargon like this is
very good at precisely describing actions and things,
but these words do not convey any obvious attitudes
about their referents.

            My analysis of computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">slang</ENAMEX> has revealed a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX> deal of ambivalence about these often mysterious
and seemingly omnipotent machines.  Some
computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">slang</ENAMEX> suggests a love-fear conflict.  One
does not have to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freudian</ENAMEX> to wonder about the
double message implied in some of these terms.

            On the one hand, there are quite a number of
words and phrases suggesting that computers are
powerful and frightening.  We definitely want to do
all we can to avoid causing a computer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> or
crash.  It is true that many computer applications began
in the military but many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are not conscious
of the military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> use expressions like
command language or launch a program.  Because
computers simulate many human activities, it is not
surprising that we should attribute all kinds of human
characteristics to them.  They do seem to possess artificial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX>; some of them create virtual reality;
and they are so efficient that they make us
wonder about why we would want to do anything in
real time any more.  When I am feeling especially
organized at work I like to tell coworkers that I'm in
the batch mode.  Computers are so seemingly lifelike
that we worry when they catch <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">viruses</ENAMEX>; we seek
to debug programs; and we do not have to be right-to-lifers
to worry if a computer application is suddenly
aborted.  Our fears are often suggested when
we say that some repetitious human activity looks
as if it is programmed.  We sometimes want to
deprogram <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who belong to dogmatic cults.

            As if to counteract or reduce the frightening
power suggested by many of these words, other
slang expressions suggest that computers are really
quite harmless.  Some of these terms go to the opposite
extreme, suggesting a warm and fuzzy, childlike
relationship that seems all too naively trusting, as if
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Red Riding Hood</ENAMEX> really could trust the wolf
dressed as her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>.  Surely we must expect
that the normal state of affairs is for computers to be
hostile, or at least unfriendly.  Why else would we so
frequently use the term user-friendly to describe operations
that are not easy to do?  And how did such a
cold and unhuman thing like a telecommunications
protocol for transferring files between a mainframe
and a microcomputer get dubbed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Kermit</ENAMEX>?  It seems
incongruous that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s television
show should be identified with such an impersonal
thing.  At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Michigan University</ENAMEX> two
names for areas within our mainframe are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Piglet</ENAMEX> and
Winnie, suggesting that all the hard, serious data and
big-time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> research is really not daunting at
all.  On the contrary, that world is as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blithe</ENAMEX> and carefree
as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Winnie the Pooh</ENAMEX> stories.  Similar words
for computer services at my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> are grog,
gumby, roo, tigger, kanga, ninny, thumper, mickey
and minnie (for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mickey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minnie Mouse</ENAMEX>), and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laurel and Hardy</ENAMEX>.  Surely the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who coined
these names are of the same mindset as those who
call miniature programs applets or refer to diagonal
or circular lines in a text as jaggies.  Reference librarians
who regularly contribute to the Stumpers
list on the Internet refer to themselves as wombats.
This apparently originated because one of the
reference questions involved these <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> marsupials,
noted for their burrowing qualities.  Surely
the nickname has stuck not only because of the metaphorical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">librarians burrowing</ENAMEX> for
answers, but also because the name sounds cute,
personalizing what otherwise might seem to be the
overly mechanical activity of finding answers to reference
questions.  So many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> use their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX>'
names for passwords that these are among the first
names a decoder would try to learn.

            I want to suggest that there is a very understandable
reason for the apparent conflict between words
like power <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kermit</ENAMEX>.  The soft, warm, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s
words allow us to allay our fears about computers
that crash and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> and abort.  It is as if the
cute words undemonized the scary ones.  I do not
have to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hacker</ENAMEX> or a tekkie in order to manage
efficiently my user-friendly computer, In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> version
of reality, those ubiquitous computers are going to
take over all aspects of life, doing away with my job
or changing it into something a robot should do,
rather than a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human being</ENAMEX>.  Another version of reality
offends <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> and is just as exaggerated, but
it is very useful as a defense mechanism.  In this view
of the world, I can feel very safe indeed--in fact, I
am more than simply safe--I am nurtured in the
warm and cuddly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s world of fun things like
floppy disks, where I can cozy up to my motherboard,
and pretend that I am a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dogcow</ENAMEX> (a trademark symbol
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Computer</ENAMEX>) for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> that can say
words like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moof</ENAMEX> when it is asked to list <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laser-Writer</ENAMEX>
options.  Fortunately, the real world of computers,
notwithstanding slang words to the contrary,
exists somewhere between the opposing fantasies of
the cold impersonality of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brave New World</ENAMEX> and the
carefree innocence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Winnie the Pooh</ENAMEX>.

            Where have you been on your travels lately?
They say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> is her best in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX>, but
you may prefer somewhere warmer, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yadian</ENAMEX>.
Myself, I can't wait to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eluosi</ENAMEX> again, although all
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> traditionally lead to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luoma</ENAMEX>, even if you are
travelling from as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meizhou</ENAMEX>.  They are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
names for, respectively, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> .

            Where in the world are these places, you may
wonder.  Maybe in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>?  Well, yes and no.  They
are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transliterations</ENAMEX> of those names, rather
than translations, and strictly speaking in the Romanization
system known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinyin</ENAMEX> should be written
with tone signs and without <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX>, since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
has pictographs, not letters as we understand
them.  They would then appear as bƒÅlƒ´, yÀòdiÀòn,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">√©lu√≥sƒ´</ENAMEX>, lu√≥mÀò , and mƒõizh≈çu .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> names of places in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> itself are of
course actually meaningful, although many have become
distorted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Westerners</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peking</ENAMEX> ,
now familiar to most in the West in its more accurate
form, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> , has a name meaning northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>,
by contrast with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanking</ENAMEX> , southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canton</ENAMEX> ,
or as it now appears on modern maps, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> ,
means broad region, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shanghai</ENAMEX> means over
the sea.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> names of neighbouring places in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX> are also often similarly meaningful and
may be translated from their language of origin.
Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gu\symbol\ngd\symbol</ENAMEX>\o means broad <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> and translates
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> name of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiroshima</ENAMEX> , while d¬Øngjƒ´ng ,
meaning eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">capital</ENAMEX>, translates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
original of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> itself is ribƒõn , literally sun
root.  (Hence its Western byname, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land of the Rising</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>.)  The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Ocean</ENAMEX> is t√†ip√≠ngy√°ng peaceful
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ocean</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> name of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> itself is
zh≈çnggu√≥ middle <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western</ENAMEX> name
is traditionally associated with that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ts</ENAMEX>'in dynasty
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">221-206</ENAMEX> BC), although actually recorded
much <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>.  (The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> for middle , a rectangular
figure bisected by a vertical line, represents a
square target pierced by an arrow.)

            Places further from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> may also sometimes
have their names translated, assuming they are already
meaningful.  Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port-au-Prince</ENAMEX> , capital of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haiti</ENAMEX>, is t√†iz<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">\isymbol\gƒÉng</ENAMEX> , literally great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> port, but Haiti
itself is hƒÉidi , clearly a transliteration.  However, it so
happens that this name is actually (though coincidentally)
both meaningful and appropriate, since it translates
as sea land.

            Such serendipity sends <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on a voyage of discovery,
to see what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">meanings</ENAMEX> can be aptly found in
other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> transliterated names.  The transliterations
themselves, as instanced above, may at first
seem strange.  However, once one appreciates certain
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conventions</ENAMEX>, the forms of the names fall into
shape.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> do not distinguish l from r in
Western words or names, for example, so that these
letters when transliterated may appear as either.
Hence lu√≥mƒÉ for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> and bƒÅl√≠ for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, but
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">l\isymbol\sƒ´bƒõn</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>, and l√∫nd√πn for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>.  Similarly,
initial b or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> can give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese m</ENAMEX> , so that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX>
(with Western r as well) is mil≈≠ and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX> m√†ng≈≠ .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> r itself is closer to Western sh [\?\] or zh
[<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].  Hence ru√¨diƒÉn for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX> and r√¨n√®iwƒÉ for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Geneva</ENAMEX>.
Generally, too, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> does not have consonant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> or words ending in a vowel (except the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nasal -ng [Œ∑</ENAMEX>] as in bƒõijƒ´ng ).  This means that vowels
appear in transliterations where one does not expect
them.  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> is therefore <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bƒÅg√©d√°</ENAMEX> .  The transliteration
itself is often from the native form of the name.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> is thus xƒ´bƒÅny√° , from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Espa√±a</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">d√©y√¨zh√¨</ENAMEX> , from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Deutschland</ENAMEX> .

            Not all names produce a fortuitous literal meaning
as apt as that for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haiti</ENAMEX> .  But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, as mƒõizh≈çu ,
has a name that happens to mean beautiful
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">continent--America the Beautiful</ENAMEX>, after all--while
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX> is yƒ´nggu√≥ , brave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.  (This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>
never did, nor never shall, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lie</ENAMEX> at the proud foot
of a conqueror, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bard</ENAMEX> penned.)  Even <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>
seems to have a historic reference, since bƒÅl√≠ literally
means clayball multitude: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> name of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lutetia</ENAMEX> , comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaulish</ENAMEX> luto <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mud</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX>.

            In the names of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> the second
element is not part of the transliteration but the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> word for, respectively, continent and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.  Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">continents</ENAMEX> also have names that are
part transliteration, part zh≈çu : <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> is o≈´zh≈çu ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, yƒÅzh≈çu , and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> fƒìizh≈çu .  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of these have names that could literally be interpreted,
hardly flatteringly, as inferior continent
and wrong continent, but the first element of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s
name has no corresponding sense.

            There are some curiosities.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> name
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iceland</ENAMEX> is bƒ´ngdƒÉo .  This is clearly not a transliteration
but a translation: it literally means ice island,
with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> element apparently mistranslating
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Icelandic</ENAMEX> name for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, ƒ™sland ice
land as island.  Nearer home, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> name for
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> is ch√°oxi√§n .  This literally means seatide
fresh, not inappropriately, but is actually a transliteration
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chos√∂n</ENAMEX> , which means land of the
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> name for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocean</ENAMEX>, on the other hand, is quite different: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">d√†xƒ´y√°ng</ENAMEX>
great western ocean.

            It has to be said that if one attempts a literal
translation of many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> placenames one simply
ends up with a sense that is surreal rather than suitable.
Many cannot be meaningfully translated at all.
Of those that yield some sense, the following handful
may be considered poetic coincidences:

Nomenclature




            The names that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> pop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> adopt
would, at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance, appear to be as vacuous
and bland as the worst of the western pop their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers/producers</ENAMEX>/arrangers
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plagiarize</ENAMEX> and instruct/
command them to play.  Not for them the teen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> angst, rebellion and outrage expressed
by such band names as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sex Pistols, The</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nipple Erectors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Slits</ENAMEX> (all-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ho ho Hemingway</ENAMEX>),
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dead Kennedys, The Butthole Surfers, Kid</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kommode</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bidet Boys</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pogue Mahone</ENAMEX> (now
knows as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Pogues</ENAMEX> since being dropped from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX>'s playlist because some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX>
that pogue mahone meant kiss my arse in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Irish</ENAMEX>), and
so on.  What is interesting about some of these purveyors
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> pap--I mean pop--is how their
names appear on CD, cassette, and other labels and
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> pop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX>.

            For this to be appreciated I must first briefly
describe the complex <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> system of writing.  It
consists of borrowed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ideograms</ENAMEX> (characters
known as kanji , the hiragana syllabary used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
words not covered by kanji , the katakana syllabary
used for foreign words, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> alphabet
known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">romanji</ENAMEX> usually used for abbreviations
like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX> and acronyms like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GATT</ENAMEX> .  You can see the
whole consort effortlessly dancing together on the
front page of any <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>.  In the case
of the names of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pop groups</ENAMEX>, this concatenation,
however, assumes truly awesome and bizarre proportions,
surely unknown, indeed not even possible,
in any other <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casanova</ENAMEX>'s English




            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Some years ago</TIMEX> I worked as an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> in
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> not far from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Adriatic Riviera</ENAMEX>,
which is flooded with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>.  Not
surprisingly, some of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> came along primarily
to acquire a smattering of spoken <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> to
help them chat up holidaying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.  For such
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, the somewhat tedious rules of English spelling
were of scant interest, I lav you, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pleas com</ENAMEX> and
leave whit me in my aus was typical of the kind of
useful phrase that they might jot down in their
notebooks.  This devil-may-care attitude to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quaint</ENAMEX> rules of English spelling follows firmly in the
illustrious footsteps (or perhaps penstrokes) of the
greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> of them all, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giacomo Casanova</ENAMEX>.

            Born a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian, Casanova</ENAMEX> led a peripatetic life
which took him through almost every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>
in search of fame, fortune, and female attractions.
In his day <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> was the international language,
spoken by anyone who aspired to a place in
high society in any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, but during his brief visit
to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1763-64</TIMEX> he made an attempt to pick
up a smattering of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  In his autobiography,
written <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years later</TIMEX>, he proudly demonstrates
his knowledge, casually throwing <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words into
the middle of his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> text with an easy confidence
and some bizarre spelling.

            He arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dover</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1763</TIMEX> in a paq-bot
which he shared with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bedfort</ENAMEX>.  His
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteen-hour</TIMEX> coach journey took him through
Cantorberi before reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, where he
called on a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> of his who now lived in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soho Squarre</ENAMEX>.  She did not give him a particularly
warm reception, however, and he was soon on the
lookout for a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> to rent for himself.  With the help
of an English-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, he examined the columns
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advertisser</ENAMEX> and quickly found the ideal
bachelor pad--a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pale</ENAMEX>-Male--which he
moved into at once, making sure that the Auskeper
would take on a French-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maidservant</ENAMEX>.

            He was keen to get to know the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> society soon showed him the
sights.  Being the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX>, he was
naturally interested in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, such as those at
Covengarde, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Drurilaine</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hai</ENAMEX>-marcket.
Casanova was also a fervent card <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> and was
soon invited to play a few robers of visk (or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wisk</ENAMEX>).  Not being accustomed to that particularly
English form of cards, he lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</NUMEX> pounds in his
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> game to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady Covendri</ENAMEX>.  He was also not entirely
familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> money and mistakenly
paid her fifteen <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">guineas</NUMEX>, thus leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady Coventry</ENAMEX>
smiling at her unexpected gain of a further fifteen
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scheling</ENAMEX> (or was it shelin, seling, or even
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chelin</ENAMEX>?).

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Casanova</ENAMEX> enjoyed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>.  He lived near such
attractions as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grim</ENAMEX>-pare and the new royal residence
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bukingan Aus</ENAMEX>.  A brief stroll up WiteAle
took him towards <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chirincras</ENAMEX>.  He could enjoy
lunch at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Staren</ENAMEX>-taverne in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pique</ENAMEX>-Dille
with his good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milord Pimbrock</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pembroke</ENAMEX>],
where the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> might offer him a plate of
traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> Rochebif and a mug of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strombir</ENAMEX>.  Afterwards they might venture out to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boulingrin</ENAMEX> or, if he needed ready money
quickly, to pawn some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">possessions</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pingbros</ENAMEX>.
He could also admire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wren</ENAMEX>'s splendid new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church of St. Pol</ENAMEX> and the wonderfully efficient
Penni-post which delivered letters around the
capital.

            Casanova was a highly intelligent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and a
competent linguist.  Much of his prodigious literary
output, including his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX>-page autobiography, was
written in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, which was a foreign language to
him.  So why was his written <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> so haphazard?
Part of the answer lies in the spell-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as</NUMEX>-you-like
nature of our language at a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s dictionary
was still a novelty, though while some of his
variant spellings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">shilling</NUMEX> , for example, are typical
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casanova</ENAMEX>'s spelling
would look more at home in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaucerian</ENAMEX> text than
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age of Englishtenment</ENAMEX>.  Besides, he did
not write his life story till <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</TIMEX> after his visit to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX>, with no more than his memory to rely on
when writing a language he had spoken but, very
likely, not written before.  But most important of all is
that the situation did not worry him.  He loved to
communicate and was happy to charge headlong at
the language and have a go regardless of the risk of
mistakes--an attitude which many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> today
might do well to learn from.

            Maybe it would bring a smile to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casanova</ENAMEX>'s lips
to know that even now, although the world and the
relative importance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language have
changed so much, those of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">countrymen</ENAMEX> who style
themselves as his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heirs</ENAMEX> retain his enthusiastic disregard
for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> spelling.  As he would doubtless
have observed in his perfectly idiomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>,
Plus ca change, plus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">c'est la m√</ENAMEX>™me chose.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safire's Syndrome</ENAMEX>




            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Safire</ENAMEX>, the political and language columnist
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , has been
concerned about the correct use of the apostrophe
and s with proper nouns ending in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">s</ENAMEX> , particularly
with eponyms, so concerned that he has named a
syndrome for himself: <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Safire's syndrome</ENAMEX> --the urge
to correct.  His compulsion emerged when both
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> were diagnosed as having
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Graves's disease</ENAMEX>, one of several eponyms for hyperthyroidism,
a common condition caused by excessive
secretion of thyroid hormone.

            Which leads to the use of medical eponyms,
proper names, usually of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> or places, to designate
diseases; their signs and symptoms, alone or in
combination; reflexes, and a host of other medical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phenomena</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dorland's Medical Dictionary</ENAMEX> , 26th
edition (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>), devotes more than nineteen columns
to short definitions of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, the vast majority eponymous,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> named for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> who early described
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperthyroidism</ENAMEX>.  Fortunately, only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graves</ENAMEX>'s
name ends in s but his is the overwhelmingly favored
eponym of English-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>.  Dorland
also listed 488 signs, again mostly eponymous,
of different diseases, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> in thyrotoxicosis.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-five</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> commemorated were
western <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> active between
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1860 and 1920</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of intensive correlation of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bedside</ENAMEX> and pathological findings, whose names now
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">linger</ENAMEX> as historical markers.

            But historical background offers little help in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Safire's syndrome</ENAMEX>, because criteria
for correct use of apostrophes and s 's for
proper nouns ending in s are lacking.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fowler</ENAMEX> noted
the problem favoring s 's but made no specific reference
to the conversion of proper possessive nouns to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adjectives; Strunk</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX> affirmed the propriety
of s's , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gowers</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Complete Plain Words</ENAMEX> ,
prefers s's , a choice of some importance because his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologist</ENAMEX> Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Richard</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gowers</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1845-1915</TIMEX>), is remembered for his column,
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, fasciculus, sign, solution, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>,
and tract by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dorland</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> may sensibly ask, Who owns the eponym?
Some processes are named for early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>,
as is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graves</ENAMEX>, and some for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Lou Gehrig</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</ENAMEX>), usually without their
permission or even awareness.  Should the earliest
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>, the most accurate one or the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> most
widely known today be memorialized?  One might
look to modern medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> for guidance but
little is to be had.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annals of Internal Medicine</ENAMEX> ,
organ of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American College of Physicians</ENAMEX>, abandoned
the possessive form totally in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, protesting
that eponyms are inappropriate when a directly
descriptive synonym is available.  Many medical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journals</ENAMEX>, however, have declined to follow its lead
and medical dictionaries are neither particularly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">helpful</ENAMEX> nor consistent.  By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dorland</ENAMEX>'s
28th edition had deleted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> eponymous
entries for hyperthyroidism, retaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graves</ENAMEX> but
now as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Graves disease</ENAMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> s and its possessive
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apostrophe</ENAMEX> banished.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stedman's Medical Dictionary</ENAMEX> ,
26th edition (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>), argues that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graves</ENAMEX> ' is
correct, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Churchill</ENAMEX> lexicon (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>) omits
both apostrophe and s with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graves</ENAMEX> but keeps both
with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parry's disease</ENAMEX> , another eponym for hyperthyroidism.

            Those who prescribe written usage offer no
guide at all as to how to handle the problem posed
by the spoken word.  How can <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Rather</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peter</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennings</ENAMEX> let his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> know when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX> suffers
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eponymously</ENAMEX>?  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scriptwriter</ENAMEX>,
and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> might have thought that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> were ill with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Grave disease</ENAMEX>.
And there is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bright</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> , used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> to
identify chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kidney disease</ENAMEX> of any cause which
might be called <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Bright disease</ENAMEX> by some.  And what of


Best's <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>--congenital macular degeneration
of the eye

Gross<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">'s disease</ENAMEX>--saccular dilatation of the anal
wall with retained inspissated feces (What
is a directly descriptive synonym for this
process?)

His<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">'s disease</ENAMEX>--trench fever

Little<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">'s disease</ENAMEX>--spastic palsy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Little</ENAMEX> disease

<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Tooth's disease</ENAMEX>--progressive personeal muscular

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX>)?

            

            Consider these without 's

            What if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prichard</ENAMEX> were asked to present his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> article, Whatever Happened to Frank
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Beriberi?</ENAMEX>, before an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>?  He reported that
the late, lamented <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney J. Perelman</ENAMEX> confessed that
he had <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson's disease</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson</ENAMEX> had
mine, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eisenberg</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scientific American</ENAMEX>, asserted
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perelman</ENAMEX> said he had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bright</ENAMEX>'s disease
and he has <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Parkinson</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755-1824</TIMEX>,
described paralysis agitans and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Bright</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1789-1858</TIMEX>, chronic glomerulonephritis).  Poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perelman</ENAMEX>
!  Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, however, assert that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bright</ENAMEX>
had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Groucho Marx</ENAMEX> disease and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Groucho</ENAMEX> had his.
Which then is correct, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marx</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marx</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marx</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safire</ENAMEX>'s problem, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>, too, are avoided in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linnaean</ENAMEX> nomenclature for biological classification
in that the names of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> and places are latinized
or otherwise altered, as


<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella typhi</ENAMEX>, the microbial cause of typhoid
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fever</ENAMEX>, recalls the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bacteriologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX>

Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the German <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.L.S. Neisser</ENAMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Safire's syndrome</ENAMEX> would have been of little concern
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>, before eponyms became
fashionable, and, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX>, before the adjective possessive
would modify case.  There, possessive is defined
as having possession and apostrophe as In rhetoric,
a diversion of speech to another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> or In
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grammar</ENAMEX>, the contraction of a word; as, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tho</ENAMEX>', for
though.  Use of the apostrophe to indicate possession
or in combining short words, as, isn't for is not,
is not considered.

            However, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Chicago Manual of Style</ENAMEX>, 14th
edition (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>), does offer comfort and guidance to
the perplexed, proclaiming that Most proper nouns
including most names ending in sibilants take 's as in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kansas's</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burns</ENAMEX>'s poems, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marx</ENAMEX>'s theories, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlioz</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">opera</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX>.  Among the exceptions are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>', <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX>', and names of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> syllable
whose unaccented endings are pronounced eez,
as in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Euripides' or Xerxes'</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Safire's syndrome</ENAMEX> is not limited to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>.  A
recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wine Talk</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> tried to
answer the question <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stags Leap</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stag's Leap</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stags</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leap</ENAMEX>--Which of these spellings is correct in referring

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>?  The answer: All of the
above.  The advice to the consumer, Just keep the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apostrophes</ENAMEX> straight.  Just so.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Way That They Tell 'em</ENAMEX>




            Total absence of humor, remarked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colette</ENAMEX>,
Renders life impossible.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> was correct.  Humor and the ability to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> it have been a fundamental part of human
life from the beginning.  But, as sure as there are
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> that do not travel well, so, too, is there a type
of humor and a form of language that is best appreciated
in the land of its origin.  Or, to be more specific,
in its region of origin.

            My own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>, is a classic example.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish</ENAMEX> humor can be an acquired taste.  It is so distinctly
regional, and it is peculiar to its particular
region as is the language through which it is expressed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> to the region laugh, not so much at
what is said, but at the way in which it is said.  The
listener laughs at the reconteur as much as at the
story itself.

            Listen to the lugubrious drollery of the western
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Highlander</ENAMEX>.  His stories are long and involved, and
they are best heard when you have lots of time on
your hands.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Highlander</ENAMEX> is a consummate storyteller.
Whether he is relating one in his native
Gaelic or in the lilting <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> that he learned at
school, you can almost hear the sough of the sea on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">far-off</ENAMEX>, never-to-be-seen-again Hebridean machairs
as he speaks.  There is an innocent humor to be
found in his stories, to be sure, but they are stories
that are invariably tinged with a brooding sort of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sadness</ENAMEX>.  You are glad that you listened, but you are
left with a louring aura of melancholy around you
long after you have taken your leave of him.

            Over on the east coast the humor is sharp and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incisive</ENAMEX>.  It is a sardonic wit, a wit that can be as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">savage</ENAMEX> and biting as the dry northern winds that sear
this land for a goodly part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>.  It has much of
the pawky vulgarity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Glasgow</ENAMEX> wit, but it is different
somehow, much more personal.  It is wit between
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>.  On the other hand, listening
to the banter between gaggles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glaswegians</ENAMEX> at<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">,</ENAMEX>
say, their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barras</ENAMEX> market on any <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> of the year
is like listening to the discordant yakking of jackdaws
around derelict tenement chimneys in the
nesting season.

            Far away from all those, down at the southernmost
tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>, both humour and dialect have a
decidedly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> flavor.  With the green glens of Antrim
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just a short</TIMEX> hop across the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, this might not,
on the face of it, seem so surprising.  But there is
more to it than that.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wigtownshire</ENAMEX> (as the county
was called until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehall</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> dropped
the ancient name in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX> and decreed that it be
merged with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dumfries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galloway</ENAMEX>) has been relucant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> to many incomers.  The earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>,
the shy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mesolithic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> and the mysterious
Picts, vanished for ever into the moorland mists before
the invaders.  With them, they took their language.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> came and went, leaving not so much
as a place name behind him.  Indeed, had not his
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> been adopted by the scholastic monks of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">day</ENAMEX>, little would have remained to show that he had
ever been there in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VENI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIDI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VICI</ENAMEX>,
he crowed smugly.  And then, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian friend</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> so succinctly put it, He just buggered off.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celt</ENAMEX> brought religion and the Gaelic.  In
fact, the eccelesiastic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ninian</ENAMEX> brought Christianity
here long before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columba</ENAMEX> reached <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iona</ENAMEX> in AD 563.
Unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celt</ENAMEX> left his mark in the many
place names of Gaelic origin scattered around southern
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX> to this day.  Stranraer, the largest town
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wigtownshire</ENAMEX>, is one such.  Its name means, literally,
fat peninsula, from the Gaelic sr√≤n reamhar .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaelic</ENAMEX> was the mother tongue in Wigtownshire
for twelve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, but little trace of it remains
in the spoken language <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.  It was the pervasive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Anglo-Saxon</ENAMEX> who really set the foundation for the
dialect spoken by the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of Wigtown
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Man</ENAMEX>.

            But it was with nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ulster</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>
had the greatest affinity.  Indeed, to this day
they call themselves, and their dialect, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galloway</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX>.
It is as good a name as any.  Although it is
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> that they speak, you would hardly think so
when you first hear them in full flow.  It is a lingo
that has little in common with either the slow, precise
enunciation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Highlander</ENAMEX> or the clipped
phraseology of Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">No√´l Coward</ENAMEX>.  It is a thick macedoine
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broad Scots</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Ulster English</ENAMEX>, and it has a
harsh and uncompromising rasp to it, especially if
you don't understand a word that is being said to
you--which, it might be added, is quite often the
case if you are a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newcomer</ENAMEX> to that part of the world.
Simple phrases like I wish to dismantle it become
Ah'm gaan <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tae tak</ENAMEX>' it sinnery , and even simpler words
like foolish become glaikit , so that by the end of
your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first day</TIMEX> you are desperately searching for
strong <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> of a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interpreter</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galloway</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> are a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of humor.
There can, admittedly, be a bitterly Schadenfreude
quality to some of it, for theirs is a hard life.  But,
more often than not, it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> that surfaces.
Occasionally--and particularly for those not accustomed
to the dialect--their pronunciation of certain
words can lead to embarrassing misunderstandings,
as the following tale from my youth may illustrate:

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aul' Wullie</ENAMEX> was a smallholder.  His only interest
in life was his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX>, and he labored long and hard
among the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> and the whins to wrest a living of
sorts from the reluctant soil.  It was a way of life that
would have crippled many a lesser <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, but Wullie
was a tough old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>: when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of his hundredth
birthday dawned he was still maintaining a keen interest
in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> affairs of his little place.

            The old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> would have been content to allow
the occasion of his centenary to pass unremarked,
but his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> had other ideas.  They arranged a
mighty soiree for the great day, and they invited a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> from the county <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> to be there to
interview him.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>--a demurely austere
product of colonial missionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>--was on her
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> assignment and she was, in fact, completely new
to this area.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wullie</ENAMEX> seemed preoccupied and the interview
was not going well.  In desperation, she asked him if
there was anything she could do to make his day
complete.  A spark of life glimmered at last in the
old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s rheumy eyes.

            Aye, he replied with sudden interest, There
is that, lassie.  Ye cud gie me some sex.

            She recoiled in shock.  When she had recovered
somewhat, her messianic zeal got the better of her
and she reminded him that, at his age, he should be
more concerned with thoughts of the afterlife than
with the prurient temptations of this one.  She would
probably have pursued this subject at some length
had not the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> interrupted her.

            Mebbee ye're richt, lassie, he said, But ah
still need the sex.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ye</ENAMEX> see, ah've got foarty-fower
hunnerwecht o' tatties oot there ahint the byre, an'
ah've nae sex tae pit them in.

            It's the way that they tell'em, as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Carson</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comedian</ENAMEX>, would no doubt remark.

            It is a peaceful place.  There have been no battles
on its soil since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times.  Although many of
its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> have died on foreign shores under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">banner</ENAMEX>, the land itself has slumbered undisturbed.
A single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> jettisoned by a fleeing German
bomber during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1939-45</TIMEX> war plopped into a
remote bog, scaring the living daylights out of a
nesting moorhen, but that was about all.  The horrors
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> blitz belonged to another planet:
things that were read about in newspapers but
which were barely comprehended by the majority in
this tranquil little backwater.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> had entered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> and the European
conflict was drawing to a close.  I was standing
in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wigtownshire</ENAMEX> forest, eavesdropping on a conversation
between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>.  They were cynics,
as most old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">countrymen</ENAMEX> are, and neither could be
convinced that the war just ending would be the war
to end all wars.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of them, an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">campaigner</ENAMEX>
with the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Guard</ENAMEX>, was particularly eloquent.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeest</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tak</ENAMEX>' heed o' whut ah tell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ye</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Erchie</ENAMEX>,
warned the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sage</ENAMEX>, They'll be anither waar yit.  An'
whun it dis stert, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ah wud wadjir ma</ENAMEX> wumman an'
weans <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agin yours</ENAMEX> that it 'ull be a faar waar waar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th'n</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>' last waar wur.

            Indeed it will.  But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">invader</ENAMEX> had better come
prepared if he ventures beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hadrian</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wall</ENAMEX>.  He
is in for a long, long haul in the wind and the rain
and the sleet if he wishes to master the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galloway</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX>.

            More Famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> Etymologies




            A little learning has always been a dangerous
tool in the mind of the amateur etymologizer, and
early acquaintance with one or more of the languages
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> Aborigines not infrequently
proved seductive.  Take that universally popular
caged <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>, the budgerigar , first encountered in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inland of New South Wales</ENAMEX> and known to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from the 1840s</TIMEX>.  Its name was first written
down as betcherrygah , that being a transliteration of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yuwaalaraay</ENAMEX> word gijirrigaa (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yuwaalaraay</ENAMEX> being
a language similar to the better-known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamilaroi</ENAMEX>),
but the temptation to explain the word had triumphed
over the etymologizing process as early as
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1848</TIMEX>, when the spelling budgery garr was preferred,
and the first element explained as meaning in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">black</ENAMEX>'s language--good or handsome.  It is true
enough that budgerry (or bujari as it is more correctly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcribed</ENAMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> language Dharuk
meant good.  But in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> language only, its
familiarity to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> ears being the result of its taking
on in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> pidgin as a term of approbation
from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 1790</TIMEX>.  What more natural than that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX> perception of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> destined to become a
plaything of the western world--as evidenced by
another of its names, the lovebird --should become
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paramount</ENAMEX>.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> now the shortened form
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">budgie</ENAMEX> is in more common use--but that is another
story.

            Another world that exercised the etymological
imagination is billabong , which owes its currency
outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> to the familiarity of the national
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">song</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waltzing Matilda</ENAMEX> , of which it is a crucial part.
Here again a word was broken down into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">billa creek</ENAMEX> and bang or bung dead, and
little thought given to the fact of their independent
origin.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Billabong</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> recorded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1830s</TIMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southeastern New South Wales</ENAMEX> as a name in the
Wiradhuri language for a watercourse which flows
after rain, and hence any backwater, blind creek, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anabranch</ENAMEX> left in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of a river, a pool which is
left when the connecting stream dries up.  It is not
the source of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">billy</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> dialect word for a milk
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pail</ENAMEX>, nor does it have anything to do with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Queensland Aboriginal</ENAMEX> word bung dead, which
passed into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> pidgin in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1840s</TIMEX> and which
developed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1880s</TIMEX> the application bankrupt,
as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>'s gone bung .  Tempting as this suggestion
may be, it is geographically and chronologically
impossible.

            Yet another <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> word, borak , was held by
some to be the etymon of barrack , although the probability
has to be that this is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> regional dialect
word given a new lease of life in fresh circumstances.
Borak was a negative in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> language
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wathawurung</ENAMEX> and was one of a comparatively small
number of words which the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> languages collectively
contributed to an on-the-whole short-lived
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> pidgin.  Borak was borrowed in the late
1830s and, perhaps because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dharuk</ENAMEX> negative
baal was already in use, did not last long in its primary
sense.  But it almost simultaneously developed a
secondary sense as a noun meaning nonsense, rubbish,
a synonym for the more frequently used gammon ,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> cant word for guile or deceit that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">convicts</ENAMEX> brought with them and which also moved in
the direction of nonsense or humbug.  Oddly,
borak was coupled with the verb poke in the phrase to
poke borak at , meaning to deride, and this was close
enough to the transitive use of the verb barrack ridicule,
jeer at, verbally abuse to suggest that the two
might be connected.  And, in the absence of a memory
of its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> use, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aboriginal</ENAMEX>, being to hand,
seemed to some a possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.

            Again, what needs to be taken into account is
the balance of probabilities.  It is unlikely that a borrowed
word would undergo a significant change in
form so quickly and, with hindsight, it is more likely
that an impreciseness of meaning caused by unfamiliarity
should attend the bringing into vogue of a
word amongst those who did not have a dialect
memory of it.  So barrack , attested as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> term for bragging, shifts slightly but not contextually
in meaning to the vociferous denigration of
a sporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> in a fight, and admits
the converse of this in the intransitive verb barrack
for support.  And the less said the better about another
conjectural etymology which would have it
that this partisan practice began in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Melbourne</ENAMEX> and
characterized the behavior of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> at the police
barracks end of the ground.

            Such behavior was often associated with larrikins .
And the etymology of this word has also been
hotly disputed, even if mostly by the lunatic fringe.
The golden rule has to be that, if there is a historically
valid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, it is to be preferred unless the circumstantial
evidence makes a mockery of it.  In this
case the presence of a high proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> regional
dialect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> amongst the convicts and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX>
who emigrated or were transported to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>
argues incontrovertibly in favor of a dialect origin if a
potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">etymon</ENAMEX> can be shown to exist.  One can,
even if there is a perceptible difference between the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">benign OED</ENAMEX> definition a mischievous or frolicsome
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> a young urban rough.
The circumstantial evidence provided by the historical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX>'s quotations documents the shift, and
there is no case for resorting to the fable that the
word derives from the description of such youths
larking about.
         
         
            Some Secrets of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Nicknames</ENAMEX>



            Names are a tricky subject in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as in any
language, but happily a very few facts go a
long way towards explaining the origins of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> nicknames and family names.  Many family
names are patronymics, so called because they
are based on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> name of some long-ago <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> patronymics fall into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> common types:
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)  the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s name alone, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Will</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s
name plus possessive -s , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Williams</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wills</ENAMEX> ,
meaning, in effect, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s
name plus -<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Williamson or Wilson</ENAMEX> .
(Sometimes spelling disguises the clarity of these
forms: for instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davies</ENAMEX> is really <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Davy</ENAMEX>'s
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dixon</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> .)  Not all patronymic-like
names are based on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s name; they might also
recall an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lord</ENAMEX> , or a female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX>,
like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Jillian</ENAMEX> (from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juliana</ENAMEX> ).

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patronymic</ENAMEX> can be based on a full name ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William</ENAMEX>-s )
or a nickname ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX>-s ).  That is important because
many familiar patronymics are based on otherwise
obsolete nicknames, as we shall see.  A lot of
these ancient nicknames had cute diminutive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">suffixes</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> of these remains productive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>,
the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">- y or - ie</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willy or Willie</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle English</ENAMEX>
had several others at hand.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Saxon</ENAMEX> provided
- kin , as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX>-kin and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom-kin</ENAMEX> , whence <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkins</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tompkins</ENAMEX> ; and - cock , as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX>-cock , whence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcox</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> provided - ot , as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>-ot and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip-ot</ENAMEX> ,
whence the surnames <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philpott</ENAMEX> ; and -in
or -on , which could turn <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary to Marion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick to Dickon</ENAMEX> (whence <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX> ), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin</ENAMEX> (whence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robbins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX> ).  All of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suffixes</ENAMEX> show up again and again in surnames, so
they can be quickly recognized.

            Harder to recognize are certain distortions imposed
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> names when they are
clipped down to nicknames.  Usually, to make a first
name into a nickname we just pluck out the most
prominent syllable, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sue from Susan</ENAMEX> , and either
leave it plain or make a diminutive out of it by adding
- ie or - y: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susie</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzy</ENAMEX> .  Some names refuse one or
both of these tricks ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura</ENAMEX> makes only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurie</ENAMEX> , not
* <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laur</ENAMEX> ); but they are about the only ones left to us in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Modern English</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle English</ENAMEX>, however, had
many other ways to play around with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> name to
make new nicknames, including the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> patterns
of consonant substitution discussed below.  Many of
the resulting forms remain current as nicknames (or
indeed as names in their own right), others are preserved
only in patronymics, and still others have
vanished entirely.  Listed below by consonant category
are all the forms I have been able to find, regardless
of their modern currency.  Some of the
stranger ones are from a list in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomas Nugent</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Pocket Dictionary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Languages</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1834</TIMEX>).  Note that a few names
fall into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> category.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)  r becomes d or h.  This affects <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just three</NUMEX>
names: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert</ENAMEX> makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dob</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hob</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger</ENAMEX> makes
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hodge</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX> makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hick</ENAMEX> , or
Hitch --though not * <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ditch</ENAMEX> , apparently!  This is the
origin of the surnames <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hobbes and Hopkins</ENAMEX> (i.e.,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hobs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hobkins</ENAMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Hitchcock</ENAMEX> ,
among other things, including some famous sobriquets.
Yokels, for example, are called hicks in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and hodges in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>; and because workhorses
once often sported the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert</ENAMEX> , we call a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">prototype horse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Old Dobbin</ENAMEX> and our ancestors
called <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rocking horses hobby horses</ENAMEX> .  Pursuing a favorite
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pastime</ENAMEX> was known as riding one's hobby <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> ,
the origin of hobbies .  There are also some similarlooking
names that merit attention.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert</ENAMEX>
seems to have been created by phonological assimilation,
the final b attracting an initial b , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger</ENAMEX> have no corresponding nicknames * <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bick</ENAMEX>
and * Bodgee .  The surname <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dodd</ENAMEX> is rooted in an obsolete
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> name, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dodda</ENAMEX> (though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dodson</ENAMEX> seems to
be a variant of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodgson</ENAMEX> ).  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hud of Hudson</ENAMEX> was a
nickname for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh</ENAMEX> ; another name
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rooted in Hugh</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hutchins</ENAMEX> , via the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> diminutive
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huchon</ENAMEX> .

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)  r becomes <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">l.  Thus Dorothy to Dolly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold</ENAMEX>
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hal</ENAMEX> (and also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry to Hal</ENAMEX> , via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harry</ENAMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mal</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peregrine to Pel , and Sarah to Sally</ENAMEX> .  It
is comforting to find that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dolley Madison</ENAMEX> was christened
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothea</ENAMEX> , and perhaps not so comforting that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molly</ENAMEX> shows up also in gun molls <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangsters girlfriends</ENAMEX>.'

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)  r vanishes.  This was happening long before r-
dropping became common in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> accents: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara</ENAMEX>
to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Babs, Bartholomew to Bat, Bridget to Biddy</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher to Kit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy to Dot</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frances to Fanny</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Harriet to Hat, Herbert to Hab or Hub</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX> to
Judd, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret to Maggie</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meg, Margery</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madge</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mattie</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theresa</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tess</ENAMEX> .


            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>)  I vanishes.  Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice to Assy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gib</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melissa</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Misa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip to Phip</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pip</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wat</ENAMEX> --and perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles to Chaz</ENAMEX> , though I think
that is just a joke pronunciation for the abbreviation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chas</ENAMEX> .  As nicknames, most forms in this set are obsolete,
and perhaps for good reason: I knew a Melissa
who absolutely hated being called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Missy</ENAMEX>.  But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gib</ENAMEX>,
Phip , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wat</ENAMEX> survive in patronymics: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gibbons</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibbs</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phipps; Watson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watkins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Watts</ENAMEX> .  Electrical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">watts</ENAMEX> were named for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> engineer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Watt</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> will recall <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wat Tyler's Rebellion</ENAMEX>
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1381</TIMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>)  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> or h becomes <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">n.  Thus Abigail to Nab</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrose</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nam</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne to Nan</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edward</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ned</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eleanor or Helen to Nell, Humphrey to Nump</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac to Nykin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabel</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nib, Obadiah</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nobs</ENAMEX> , and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver to Noll</ENAMEX> .  These nicknames originated as possessives,
since <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle English</ENAMEX> words beginning with
a vowel or silent h took the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">possessive mine</ENAMEX> instead
of my ; so instead of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX>,  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> said mine
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX>,  which was reinterpreted as my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nan</ENAMEX>,  just
as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> once called an eft or an ewt is
now known as a newt.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of these nicknames
developed notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver Cromwell</ENAMEX>
was known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iron Noll</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s verses of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrose Philips</ENAMEX> ensured the everlasting fame of his
nickname, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Namby Pamby</ENAMEX> .

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>)  m becomes p.  This applies to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only four</NUMEX> names:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meg</ENAMEX> makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Margery</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madge</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">makes Paige</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mattie</ENAMEX> makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patty</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mal</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molly</ENAMEX> makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pal</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polly</ENAMEX> .  All Pattys
nowadays are probably <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patricias</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nugent</ENAMEX> did list
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patty for Martha</ENAMEX> .

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>)  th becomes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">t.  Thus Anthony to Tony</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthur</ENAMEX>
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bartholomew</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bart or Bat</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cat</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Kitty</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy to Dot</ENAMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Dorrit</ENAMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth to Betty</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bet</ENAMEX> (whence
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bessie</ENAMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martie</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mattie</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew</ENAMEX>
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nathaniel to Nat or Nate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodore</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theresa</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tess</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tracy</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas to Tom</ENAMEX> .  In
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1600s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Classical</ENAMEX>
words and names such as these was pronounced
as plain t after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fashion, as is still the case
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> and the other nicknames in this
set are partly just phonetic spellings of the old
sounds of the full names.  Note that the old t-for-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>
sound survives also in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Esther</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Theresa</ENAMEX>, the river
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thames</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> pronunciation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony</ENAMEX> as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antony</ENAMEX>, and the name of the spice thyme , usually
called time.

            In the nicknames <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Babs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nobs</ENAMEX>, the suffix -s is
an old diminutive suffix like - y; in fact, a few nicknames
apparently combine the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patsy</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suffix</ENAMEX> still surfaces occasionally, as for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prince William</ENAMEX>, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wills</ENAMEX>.  (This is
distinct from the patronymic - s of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Wills</ENAMEX> .)  One
last diminutive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">suffix</ENAMEX> is - o , a macho one for boys
only-- <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tommo for Tommy</ENAMEX> .  This has a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring</ENAMEX>,
but it is older than it looks: in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Butler</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudibras</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from the late 1600s</TIMEX>, I find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ralpho</ENAMEX> .
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Badges Redux</ENAMEX>




            Everyone remembers the classic scence from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Treasure</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Madre</ENAMEX> in which the banditos
encounter that dark-minded prospector, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humphrey</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart</ENAMEX>, in the rugged <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains of Mexico</ENAMEX>.

            I found a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dove</ENAMEX> in her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nest</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ha ha ha ha</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ha</ENAMEX>!, reports a subordinate bandito (in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>) to
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>.  She was hidden.

            Bandito Number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonso</ENAMEX>
Bedoya, calls out to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oiga Se√±or</ENAMEX>: We are the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federales</ENAMEX>.  You know, the mounted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>.  (He
pronounces it mohnted.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart</ENAMEX>: If you're the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>, where're your
badges?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bedoya</ENAMEX>'s smooth <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> face contorts into a
sneer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Badges</ENAMEX>?  We ain't got no badges.  We don't
need no badges.  And, shouting angrily, I don't
have to show you any stinking badges!

            This brief soliloquy is notable in several respects.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> and most obvious is its use of repetition,
perhaps the simplest poetic device.  And it
might also be considered an example of pleonasm,
the use of more words than those necessary to denote
mere sense; redundancy, or tautology.

            But most remarkable is that only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> sentence
is grammatically correct.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are
merely slang, but by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bedoya</ENAMEX> has become
so enraged that he resorts to speaking correct
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.

            I submit that he does so because he knows he will
thereby communicate more effectively.  As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joseph</ENAMEX>

must also recall that soon after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bedoya</ENAMEX>'s last assertion
the shooting starts.  Perhaps if he had displayed
some badges, authentic or otherwise, he might
have more easily achieved his objective.)

            Furthermore, in speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">correct English</ENAMEX>, Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bedoya</ENAMEX> also reveals his identity as a relatively learned
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, undoubtedly a major reason that he is the jefe of
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX>.  Emotion will betray character every time,
and education is power.

[XXI<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX>], as I was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with my grandpa
when he said that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> told him to sit
in the front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> for the present; he waited and
waited and she never gave it to him.  Collecting lists
of silliness is a legitimate pastime.  I collect matchbooks
and names that end in - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ford</ENAMEX> .  My collections are
completely without academic merit but they amuse
me.  To compare the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wellerisms</ENAMEX> to
brick-wall comedians is to overlook a generational, if
not historical and unfortunate shift in humor.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> of
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandpa</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> were amused by the

            What's eating you?




            
               What's eating you?  If you are a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the
Mina ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Africa</ENAMEX> it could be almost
anything, even your own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, as the phrase for I
have a headache in its literal translation means My
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> is eating me.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mina</ENAMEX>, a language spoken in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Togo</ENAMEX> and parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Benin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ghana</ENAMEX>, the verb to eat
is used in many phrases that have nothing to do with
food.

            If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mina</ENAMEX> is suffering he will say that
he is eating the wind, if he is comfortable he will
say that he is eating life, if someone lends him
money he will say he has eaten their credit.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Birthdays,</ENAMEX>
religious festivals, and anniversaries are also
eaten.

            Whereas it is easy to explain this by referring to
the cultural importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX>,
the same reasoning can hardly be applied to the case
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, which has its own fair share of food
images.  While our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> eat up the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX>, we chew
over ideas, digest information, devour with our eyes,
make mincemeat of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>, and take what they
say with a pinch of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> .  We are forced to eat our
words and our hats and we occasionally bite off more
than we can chew .  All of which should give us food
for thought.
            

         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">English As She Is</ENAMEX> Minced




            <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is the compulsory <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> language in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>.  For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of the language whose
mother tongue is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> brings an additional
challenge, learning a new alef bet Alphabet
with its accompanying new rules.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hebrew</ENAMEX> has a script generally written without
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vowels</ENAMEX>--except for prayer books and books for little
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.  After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first few years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
do without them.  The vowels are marks above and
mainly below the consonants:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S CN B SN N THS XMPL</ENAMEX>
A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A  E EE I  I   EA  E</ENAMEX>

            

            By the time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> start to learn English they
are fluent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> of vowelless <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>.
Consequently, learners of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> or of any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
script language tend to skip a few vowels here and
there in a cavalier manner, or, if you prefer, with
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chutzpa</ENAMEX>, as if they were saying, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BG DL</ENAMEX>,
they're only stpd vwls, we'll pt a few in fr <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> stpd
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tchr</ENAMEX> who cn't rd <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> without them.

            In addition, several consonants do double duty
by adding a dot within the letter.  Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V.</ENAMEX>=B,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">f.</ENAMEX>=<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">k.h</ENAMEX>=k, .s=s, and S.=<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH</ENAMEX>.  These marks are also
discarded with the vowels, so that often one has to
understand by context.  That is difficult for foreign
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>, but we are not dealing with
these poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souls</ENAMEX> here.  What we are dealing with is
our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolchildren</ENAMEX>, who are writing, Why get ufset
ober a pew consonants?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> shuns initial v, f, kh, and final b, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>, k .  So
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip</ENAMEX> would be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PILIF</ENAMEX> and verb would be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BERV</ENAMEX>.
Are you still with me, dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BRVTM</ENAMEX> ?

            Learners of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> are also troubled by words
like film, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX>, and charm .  Not only is the lack of a
vowel sound between the consonants unacceptable,
but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">l</ENAMEX> and r are pronounced in all their glory:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FILLIM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CORREN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHARREM</ENAMEX>.  The fact that the vowels
are not written does not prove that they are not
there, does it?  The word fillim -- pillim for the
more literate--is very popular. - im being the usual
masculine plural ending, our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> say, I have
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fillim, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> fil in my camera and the other in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reserve</ENAMEX>.  I wonder what the singular of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verbatim</ENAMEX> is.
... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corren Pleckess</ENAMEX> is a popular breakfast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>,
replacing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kvakair Oats</ENAMEX>.

            Of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">learners</ENAMEX> who realize that most
plurals are formed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> by adding - s or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">- es</ENAMEX> have
been known to speak of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ambulance</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ambulan.
However, the singular of rail any metal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pronounced RELLS</ENAMEX>, plural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RELLSIM</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Exhaust</ENAMEX>, a word much loved in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">auto</ENAMEX> repair
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, has become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGGZOZZ</ENAMEX> and is so transliterated
into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>.

            Still, there is yet hope: now that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> has
signed a peace treaty with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX>, the sign at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frontier</ENAMEX> near my home warning approaching persons
of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">DANGER, FRONT BEHIND</ENAMEX>! has been taken down.

            I encountered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Ernest Henley</ENAMEX>'s translation
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villon</ENAMEX> poem and have had a time translating
it.  Finally, after exhausting the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX> ,
I found <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Partridge's Dictionary of Slang and</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unusual Words</ENAMEX> , which has almost all the expressions
in it.  I offer a simple glossary of terms that might be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unfamiliar</ENAMEX>, should anyone else wish to enjoy the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poem</ENAMEX>.

the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pea</ENAMEX> under it; shell game; another cheating
game.

            May I offer a few reflections on various matters
that struck me while browsing through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>?

            The article <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Politicking With Words</ENAMEX> , with its references
to rival definitions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whig</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tory</ENAMEX> , put me
in mind of a cartoon that appeared in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Punch</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1896</TIMEX>
(since republished in a collection--I don't go back
quite that far).  Beneath a drawing of a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> out
walking with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> appeared the following
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exchange</ENAMEX>:


What are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tories</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radicals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grandpapa</ENAMEX>?

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tories</ENAMEX>, my dear, are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who like to have a
queen, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lords</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishops</ENAMEX>, and more or less remain
as they are--whilst <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Radicals</ENAMEX> object to having a
queen and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Lords</ENAMEX>, and are dissatisfied
with everything and everybody, jealous of all who
are better off than themselves, and are always trying
to rob them of their property, and, in fact, they're a
pack of infernal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rogues</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scoundrels</ENAMEX>!

            And which are you, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grandpapa</ENAMEX>--a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tory</ENAMEX> or a
Radical?

            It would be pleasant to think that we could all
ignore prejudiced definition so blithely!

            A few nits to be picked, or addenda to be appended:


‚Ä¢ A rod (also a pole or perch) was indeed a premetric
measure, but it was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five and a half yards</NUMEX>,
not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four and a half</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Proper Words in Proper</ENAMEX>
Places).  When we moved into our present house
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '60s</TIMEX> we were told that the garden measured
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a half rods square</NUMEX> --the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX> is
not a simple piece of mental arithmetic, I found.

‚Ä¢ From the same article, the use of without to mean
outside persists very commonly in cryptic crossword
clues.  But then a great deal or archaic or
arcane usage crops up in that context.

‚Ä¢ The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for a tram was certainly common in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norfolk</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.K.</ENAMEX>) before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>--I can still picture
surviving pre-war signs reading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cars</ENAMEX> stop here
upon request, upon what by then were bus stops,
in my home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gt Yarmouth</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX>.

‚Ä¢ As an aside to that, it intrigues me (mildly) that
whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shortened automobile</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">auto</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scandinavians</ENAMEX> retained the other end, producing
bil for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>.

‚Ä¢ A felicitous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX>'s name that used to be displayed
prominently in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Suffolk</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of Oulton
Broad in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '50s</TIMEX> was that of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.S.D. Rich</ENAMEX>--
with reference to predecimal currency.

‚Ä¢ I would love to see anyone attempt to drink a Suffolk
Punch: this is a particularly huge and beautiful
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breed</ENAMEX> of plough-horse.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norfolk Punch</ENAMEX>, on the
other hand, is a commercial non-alcoholic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX> of
herbal origin and reputedly health-giving.

‚Ä¢ It is not only trousers that are implicitly excluded
by the printed word (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Sansculottery</ENAMEX>): the
current obsession with knowing the ingredients of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">foodstuffs</ENAMEX> has resulted in several notices on items
in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bakers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, saying Our cakes are made with
pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> only, a culinary feat.

‚Ä¢ Could the necessity for dough to be gaumy or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gormy</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">On Good Terms</ENAMEX>) be a precursor of the term
gormless meaning stupid, dull?  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alas</ENAMEX>, despite the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> spelling, gaumless, I believe the
term comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Norse</ENAMEX> gaumr heed).

            Grammatical gender lingers in popular <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
We still say, Fill 'er up of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or She's
been a good old <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>.  But in more formal standard
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English inanimate</ENAMEX> objects are now referred to by the
neuter pronoun it , though in other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>
languages that I know grammatical gender lingers as
a sort of ghost of animistic gender haunting all nouns.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Frenchman</ENAMEX> speaking his native tongue might tell
you, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre</ENAMEX> langue francaise, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elle est tr√©s belle</ENAMEX>.  Or
a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spaniard or Mexican</ENAMEX> might say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquella mesa</ENAMEX>,
puedes meterla en <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la cocina</ENAMEX>.  Only in parody of a
foreign language will a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> say anything
like: The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, she is a beautiful language
or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> as she is spoke.

            In this respect <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> pronouns referring to animals
appear to be marginal.  Although according to
current prescriptive grammar, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, especially of
unknown sex, should be referred to as it , they practically
never are in standard spoken <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  A baby
is often it , but a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> not obviously a tomcat is more
likely to be called she and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> or horse he , while
generally in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> the masculine singular pronoun
comes naturally when one is referring to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>.
Nor is this a new thing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX>
ago the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Longfellow</ENAMEX> wrote:


<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The day</TIMEX> is done, and the darkness
Falls from the wings of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Night</ENAMEX>.
As a feather is wafted downward
From an eagle in his flight.

            

            A noticeable feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as spoken by bilingual
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> is a tendency to
carry over into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> gender of whatever
living creature they are talking about.  For example,
whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglos</ENAMEX> refer to squirrels as he , some
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> will consistently call a squirrel she , presumbly
because in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Spanish the noun</TIMEX> for squirrel
( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ardilla</NUMEX> ) is feminine.

            So I was progressively puzzled to hear a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend</ENAMEX> always refer to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX>'s goldfish
as she/her .  To me the little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX>, which (whom?)
I call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Algernon</ENAMEX>, is a he, though in fact I have not a
clue as to its natural gender.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> word for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> is pez , a masculine noun, or loosely, pescado ,
which is also masculine and properly designates fish
as game or fare.  True, in sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">goldfish</ENAMEX> can be called specifically a carpa dorada ,
which is feminine, but such a term seemed unlikely
to occur in the rustic <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>.  I got
to wondering what the local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> would call a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">goldfish</ENAMEX>.  It would hardly do to ask because when
pressed for a word, a native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> will often come
up with one that he thinks is proper rather than the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in common usage.  Then I remembered that a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plumber</ENAMEX> whose <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> once admired
our truchitas (in standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> little
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trout</ENAMEX>), which he saw in a goldfish bowl we had.
Since for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> about the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> known to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> hillbillies in the mountain valleys of northern
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX>, the word for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX>,
trucha, has become generic, supplanting pez and
pescado for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> in everyday language.  So, I concluded,
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nellie Griego</ENAMEX> subliminally translated
her <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> word for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, in the process
carrying over the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> gender, it was the feminine
gender of trucha or its diminutive truchita
rather than the masculine gender of pez that she attached
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word.

            Spanish gender is not the only element of the
language of bilingual <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> that may affect their
language, whether <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>.  Context may
influence their choice of words.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few days</TIMEX> after I
had solved the gender mystery, I climbed onto the
roof of our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> to inspect the work of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roofers</ENAMEX> who were daubing pitch onto cracks in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parapets</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Hay muchos</ENAMEX> liques?  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workmen</ENAMEX>
asked me. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S√≠</ENAMEX>, I replied, en este techo <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hay</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">goteras</ENAMEX>.  I am too much a purist, not to say pedant,
to utter unnecessarily the loan word liques (from the
English leak ).  Indeed, I was slightly bothered by
having had the bastard word thrust upon me.  So
later I asked the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> who feminized the goldfish
why the roofer used liques when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> has the
common word gotera meaning the same thing.  She
was not sure; gotera sounded better to her.  But later
she consulted her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> about the matter and
passed along his analysis to me.  Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> had
said that one should speak of goteras in a roof, as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">roofers</ENAMEX> had not, but of liques in machinery, for example
in a car engine.  From this pronouncement I
extrapolated that when things are introduced into
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> culture from another, the words for and about
those things tend to come attached to the things.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Automobiles</ENAMEX> (locally called trocas ) have been introduced
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">comparatively</ENAMEX> recently into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> culture
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> from an industrialized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>
culture.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX> words such as troca (from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> ) and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lique</ENAMEX> (from leak in a troca) have entered with the
Anglo things, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> with their goteras in
flat roofs have been a part of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> culture for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">millennia</ENAMEX>.  So a car motor springs a leak, but properly
speaking, a roof or an old human body develops
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">goteras</ENAMEX> .

            Languages influence one another most conspicuously
in phonology.  A case in point occurred for
me when I was exchanging some gossip about a local
family squabble over property with the same <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> who figures in my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> anecdotes.
She shitted her out of that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> declared.
I was startled, indeed slightly shocked to
hear this from my rather prim and proper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>.  So
out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> was the scatalogical word that I
could not believe that I had heard it right.  I kept
wondering off and on about the matter till I realized
that what I had heard was a case of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">double hypercorrection.</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> lacks the phoneme i as in sit for
which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> ear and tongue tend to substitute
the i of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Francine</ENAMEX> .  And although in some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>
dialects the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> sh sound has replaced ch , in
standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> the phoneme closest to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> sh
is the affricate ch, which therefore tends to replace
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sh</ENAMEX> in the perception of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hispanophones</ENAMEX>.  Subliminally
aware of these tendencies in her speech, my unwitting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">informant</ENAMEX> had compensated for the tendencies
by reverse substitution.  Meaning to say cheated,
she had articulated sh in place of ch and the i of sit in
place of the ea .

            I believe this sort of phonetic hypercorrection is
fairly common in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX>.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Cockney English</ENAMEX>, for
example, where initial h is regularly dropped there
is a tendency to compensate by supplying initial h
where it does not belong.  There is even a trace of
this tendency in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>: Hit hain't like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'im</ENAMEX>.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain Andalusian Gypsies</ENAMEX> sometimes lisp
their s's and pronounce their soft c's and z's as s .

            Though in the short run influences of languages
and dialects on each other may result in distortion
and ridiculous or embarrassing absurdities, the longterm
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fruit of linguistic</ENAMEX> cross-pollination appears to
be enrichment, of which the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language provides
a shining example.
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Comparative Russian-English Dictionary of</ENAMEX>

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Most Important Proverbs Highlighted / English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proverb</ENAMEX> Index
            The title is justified by the comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proverbs</ENAMEX> and sayings with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> counterparts
and, where applicable, references to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>.  This is also a
timely book in light of the wide interest in post-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>.  As tourism and economic relations
develop, so does interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> language.
However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> of a foreign language soon realize
that to master it fully, it is not enough to know
the grammatical structure and basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vocabulary</ENAMEX>: one
must also memorize a fair number of phrases and
idiomatic expressions and, as a further step, proverbs
and sayings.

            Generally speaking, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> make greater
use of proverbs than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX> the late <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paremiologist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. Permiakov</ENAMEX>,
tried to establish a proverb minimum, and he
found that every <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> knew <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 800</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proverbs</ENAMEX> and sayings.

            Pre-revolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> produced a number of
dictionaries of proverbs; a well known one was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dal</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proverbs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sayings</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1862</TIMEX>),
which contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 30,000</NUMEX> entries.  The popularity
of proverbs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Russia</ENAMEX> has been reflected in
scores of dictionaries, printed in practically all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">republics</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, including
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenin</ENAMEX>, recognized early the propaganda value of
conveniently selected entries in the hands of what
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communists</ENAMEX> called agitators, apparatchiks and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">politruks</ENAMEX> political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>.  Most of their publications
excluded religious and capitalist proverbs
and sayings.  They encouraged instead the proliferation
of proletarian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> which were sold at
very low prices.

            Against the large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> of
only <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian proverbs</ENAMEX>, comparative and bilingual dictionaries,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> ones were rarely published
and they contained <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 500 and a couple of</TIMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</NUMEX> entries only.  That is why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Mertvago</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,500</NUMEX> entries is a useful addition to comparative
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">paremiographical</ENAMEX> literature.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">compiler</ENAMEX> starts with a short introduction
dealing with the definition of proverb.  This is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thankless</ENAMEX> and practically insoluble task.  He quotes
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Permiakov</ENAMEX>'s formulation, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Proverbs</ENAMEX> and proverbial
phrases are signs of situations or of a certain type of
relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> --not particularly lucid.
A more down-to-earth definition is given by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Simpson</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Concise Oxford Dictionary of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proverbs</ENAMEX>: A proverb is a traditional saying which
offers advice or presents a moral in a short and pithy
manner; but even this does not entirely satisfy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>.  The Introduction touches on the origin of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proverbs</ENAMEX> and their similarity in other languages.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erasmus' Adagia</ENAMEX> brought
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about</NUMEX> a trend to translate <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> proverbs
and quotations into national languages.  It also
started an inter-borrowing from common historical
and cultural antecedents.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mertvago</ENAMEX> also deals with the difference between
a proverb and a saying.  He quotes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
proverb, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pogovorka-tsvetok</ENAMEX>, poslovitsa--
yagodka a saying is a flower, a proverb is a berry.
The relative brevity of many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> proverbs stems
from the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> language has no articles
and also resorts idiomatically to participial
condensation by not using oblique forms of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">verb</ENAMEX> to be .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alliteration</ENAMEX> and rhyme help to memorize
them.

            The main part of the dictionary is covered in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 380</NUMEX> pages.  Each entry is numbered, which is
useful for cross-references to semantically similar entries.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> text (in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cyrillic</ENAMEX>) is followed by a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">literal</ENAMEX> translation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, unless there is a clear
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> equivalent, by which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mertvago</ENAMEX> means both
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lexical</ENAMEX> and conceptual correspondence.  Equivalents
are printed in bold face.  Where there is no equivalent
the dictionary gives a corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> version,
sometimes a few variants.

            The entries are arranged in alphabetical order by
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> letter.  There are several other methods
for arranging proverbs and sayings.  Mertvago
could have followed the modern trend and used the
key word or thematic arrangements.  However, compilers
of proverb <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> know that there is no
perfect system for arranging proverbs: each has its
advantages and flaws.  Ultimately it comes down to
personal choice and for whom the dictionary is intended.

            In a dictionary of this size, the complier is faced
with the task of including or excluding a certain quotation--not
a very easy decision when one is dealing
with a stock of scores of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Russian proverbs</ENAMEX>.
The fact is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dictionary</ENAMEX> contains popular
versions, used in modern spoken <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>.  The most
important and commonly known proverbs are
marked with an asterisk.  This will be appreciated by
the non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> who is not familiar with the
popularity of a certain proverb or saying.  There are
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX> entries with asterisks.

            There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> appendices.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> deals with more
than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">100 proverbs</TIMEX> and sayings containing personal
and geographic names.  For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chemu Vanya</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nye</ENAMEX> nauchilsya, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tovo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivan nye</ENAMEX> vyuchit What little
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnnie</ENAMEX> hasn't learnt, old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> will not learn; V
Rimye byl i <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papu nye</ENAMEX> vidal Went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, but didn't
see the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX>.  The other appendix deals with the
structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proverb</ENAMEX> and gives separate
sections of analytical proverbs, metaphorical ones,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">similes</ENAMEX>--proverbial comparisons (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 100</NUMEX>), as
well as contrasting couplets and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">negational proverbs</ENAMEX>,
etc.  There is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-page bibliography of main
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.  At the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>, there is a large
(eighty-three-page) index of English proverbs arranged
by key words and cross referenced to the
main part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>.

            To sum up, this is a comparative dictionary with
a number of useful features, as if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mertvago</ENAMEX> wanted
to fill in gaps existing in other dictionaries.  There
are hardly any printing errors and plenty of white
spacing making reading easy.  It is a commendable
publication.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronic Publishing Forum</ENAMEX>
            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX>" diskette containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forum</ENAMEX> arrived
with a friendly note from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Galuszka</ENAMEX> (telephone:
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">805</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">927-5259</TIMEX>; e-mail: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.GALUSZKA</ENAMEX>@genie.geis,<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>)
saying, This will be of interest to your computer-literate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>.  Nothing loath, we loaded it into the
computer for a run.

            Before commenting on the contents of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forum</ENAMEX> ,
I must disburden myself of some prejudices long
held against computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programmers</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>.
First, though, I must say that I have enormous
admiration for their fertile imaginations, ingenuity,
and extraordinarily facile minds: some of the
programs they have developed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> are
truly astonishing in their complexity.  That acknowledgment
having been made, I find myself continually
irritated by their cavalier dismissal of everything that
human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX> developed in the course of history: it
reflects an adolescent mentality that is scornful of
anything that might have taken place before these
parvenu geniuses put finger to keyboard.  Rather
than go into great detail, I shall focus on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> important
feature offered by many word-processing programs,
namely, alphabetization.  If one goes back to
the order in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASCII</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> are arranged
(which was a matter of system and convenience, with
little or no attempt at alphabetization, except that the
lower case and capital letters are in alphabetical order
and the numbers are in sequence), one can see
where later alphabetization programs derive their order.
As most lexicographers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">librarians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">indexers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>,
and other literate and intelligent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> know
(and as those who compile telephone directories in
some parts of the world have learned), there are preferred
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alphabetization</ENAMEX> systems.  These are generally
letter by letter (with some standardized hierarchy established
for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX>, diacritics, punctuation, numerals,
and other anomalies) and word by word (which,
though it is not usually suitable for dictionaries,
works reasonably well for certain kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>.
One has to look hard--I have, and still, without success--to
find a system that places 'tis and 'til within
reach of the letter T, that does not sort <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-238</ENAMEX> at the
end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> listings, and that does not put several
pages <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between √</NUMEX>©clat and eclectic .  I recently wrote to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novell</ENAMEX> to complain about the sorting order in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WordPerfect</ENAMEX> and received a reply, totally unresponsive,
that explained in kindly detail how I could
(mis)sort words in different columns of a database.
Perhaps a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> will rush to my aid in my <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hour</NUMEX> of
need.

            The point is not entirely irrelevant in relation to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forum</ENAMEX> .  <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> of all, neither the wrapper nor the
accompanying descriptive matter tells a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novice</ENAMEX> how
to access the information on the disc.  (The usual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Windows</ENAMEX>, is to click on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Main</ENAMEX>, then twice on
File <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Manager</ENAMEX>; then on the drive, usually A or B,
where the disc has been placed; then, move the cursor
to the listed program that has the suffix .exe,
move it to File, then down the list to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Run</ENAMEX>, and click
twice.)  No instruction is included for accessing the
information via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MS/DOS</ENAMEX>, either.  Once in the file, it is
not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s play to navigate amongst the various categories
of data.  If one goes through sequentially, he
finds this at the end of a given selection:


To read the next article, select ... <<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-2</NUMEX>.<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#</NUMEX>>*
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INDEX ........................</ENAMEX><INDEX0.#>*

            

            I could find no useful index: though there is a list of
file names, they are numerical and offer no clue as to
their contents.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Introduction</ENAMEX> offers a succinct description of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forum</ENAMEX>:

               
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronic Publishing Forum</ENAMEX> is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX>,

information on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>,
and programs related to this subject.  Information
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>'s guidelines from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>,
is also included.  Articles on related subjects
are included.  A database of electronic books ‚Äúin

this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> are the same in the shareware edition
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscriber</ENAMEX> edition, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX>
also get bundled copies of the sample programs
with their copy.  If you found this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> on
the Internet, on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBS</ENAMEX>, or one of the commercial
on-line services as file EPF20.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZIP</ENAMEX>, you have the
whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, but not the sample programs
that go with it.

            

            The foregoing reflects enthusiasm, intelligence,
and resourcefulness but it is badly written, is riddled
with the kind of jargon that frightens away anybody
not privy to the secret language of software, and,
consequently, makes the rest of its content <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspect</ENAMEX>.

            Notwithstanding, the content that was read is
not without interest and merit.  There is, for example,
a longish list of zines, described as follows:


For those of you not acquainted with the zine
world, zine is short for either fanzine or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magazine</ENAMEX>, depending on your point of view.
Zines are generally produced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> or a
small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, done often for fun or personal
reasons, and tend to be irreverent, bizarre,
and/or esoteric.  Zines are not mainstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX>--they
generally do not contain advertisements
(except, sometimes, advertisements for
other zines), do not have a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscriber</ENAMEX> base,
and are generally not produced to make a profit.

            

            There follows information about formats and,
under How Do I Get the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>zines?, a lot of instructions
given mostly in computer jargon.  It is difficult
to describe the content of this catalogue, so here is a
sample:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Hofmann</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Strange Mistake</ENAMEX>

A hypertext 'zine commemorating the 50th
anniversary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">accidental</ENAMEX> discovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSD</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 April, 1943</TIMEX>.  The document contains archives
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Hofmann</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbie</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertext fac</ENAMEX>/tion on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>-sponsored
acid tests, and testimonial solicited from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> all
over the world.

            

            There follow details identifying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, format,
and how to access the zine.  Many of the descriptions
are longer, some are shorter.  They include Armadillo
Culture (Being the excremeditation of a hyperactive
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">armadillo</ENAMEX>'s activities, opinions, and other
stuff ... ), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Athene</ENAMEX> (The online <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> of amateur
creative writing, accompanied by


NOTE: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Athene</ENAMEX> became defunct in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>.  Intertext
is its immediate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>, which I assume
is facetious), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLINK</ENAMEX> (which would like
to be a forum for the issues surrounding the intersection
of consciousness and technology.  This
is our best defense against postmodern angst: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">To</ENAMEX>
critically look at and anticipate the cultural and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> changes spurred by the rapid development
of technology).

            

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> quickly gets the impression that much of this
material comes from the fringes of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, but
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Breakaway</ENAMEX> comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX>, The Bucknellian
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bucknell University</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaos</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode Island</ENAMEX>, and so forth.

            Another file that was examined is called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unclassified</ENAMEX>
Ads, etc.  It contains a listing of a surprising
number of novels and other works (like The
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hypertext Hamlet</ENAMEX> ), none of which is accompanied by
the customary bibliographic information: in most instances,
even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> are not listed.  The prices
range from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6.00</NUMEX> (for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronic Books</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Print</ENAMEX> ) to
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20.00</NUMEX> (for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> novels by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marian Allen</ENAMEX>.  The variety
is enormous, ranging from books of poetry--or,
at least, of poems--to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better Volleyball, Bicycle</ENAMEX>
Tune-up, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">21st Century Almanac, Clowning for Fun</ENAMEX> &
Profit (a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">How-to</ENAMEX> book), and scores of other works on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fiction</ENAMEX>, nonfiction, and reference.  An order form
(which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> prints out from a computer) is provided.
The price is not omitted, but most are available for
very little--<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $5.00</NUMEX> per disc.

            In sum, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forum</ENAMEX> offers a very mixed bag, indeed,
some of it, as can be seen from the quality of
the text, bordering on the semiliterate, yet much of
it rife with ideas, some of which, depending on one's
interests and inclinations, must be said to be stimulating.
For myself, I find it tedious to read lengthy
sections of text from a screen, though that is less
likely to bother computer-philes and -phanatics.

            Not being a prospect for Internet, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Wide</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX>, or any of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> servers (as they
are called), I was relieved to see that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscriber</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forum</ENAMEX> could receive physical diskettes in the mail
and not have to access the information via modem.
Still, a computer of middling sophistication is required,
so those who have not (yet) joined the future
need not apply.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brewer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Quotations: A Phrase and Fable Dictionary</ENAMEX>
            Books of quotations are curious things.  I have
never compiled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, but I understand that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>
like them because they sell well.  As I use such
books mainly as reference books, I am probably the
wrong reviewer for this work by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">estimable</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel</ENAMEX>
Rees, a Londoner well known as the host of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX>
radio program, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Quote ... Unquote</ENAMEX> , who publishes
an amusing, entertaining, informative newsletter
with the same title.  To be brutally frank, I care little
about what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimi Hendrix</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlon Brando</ENAMEX> might
have said (or, in the latter case, mumbled): of far
greater moment are the words of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julius</ENAMEX>
Caesar, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mae West</ENAMEX>.  Whether Greta
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garbo</ENAMEX> actually ever said, I want to be alone (she
did), is of little consequence in the larger scheme of
things; but the world consists of many parts, including
many smaller--even infinitesimal--things, and
we must not turn our noses up at the exact wording
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Armstrong</ENAMEX>'s moon quotation: at least it was
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, and one need not try to explain that in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Et</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tu</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brute</ENAMEX> , the last word is not the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word brute
but the vocative case of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin Brutus</ENAMEX> and then go off
into the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">paroxysmal grammar</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> to explain
what a vocative is.

            In any event, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rees</ENAMEX> sets forth the purpose of his
book with admirable clarity in his Introduction.  (If
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> wants to know why someone wrote or compiled
a book, one should always read the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preface</ENAMEX>,
Foreword, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Introduction</ENAMEX>, or What-have-you).  After a
brief mention of some of the things the book is not,
he continues:


What <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brewer</ENAMEX>'s Quotations does contain is the
most commonly misquoted, misattributed, misascribed,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misremembered</ENAMEX> and most disputed sayings
that there are.  It also contains sayings that
are frequently unattributed, unascribed, misunderstood
and misapprehended, or words whose
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> might wish to reconsider them.

[p. ix]

            

            The reason for putting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brewer</ENAMEX> into the title (according
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rees</ENAMEX>) is that his book follows naturally in the
tradition of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">... Dictionary of Phrase</ENAMEX> and Fable
[which] singled out words and phrases with tales to
tell and did not attempt an unachievable comprehensiveness.
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>]ot attempt an unachievable comprehensiveness
is a marvelous quotation that I must
borrow for my next book, review, article, or comment
on the parlous state of the world, and I shall
now be able to preface it with, In the words of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Rees</ENAMEX> ... I found <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rees</ENAMEX>'s Introduction more
entertaining than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of the book.

            I had to put the book to some sort of test, so I
looked up I'm all right, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX> , which is not in the
fairly comprehensive Index; instead, I found it under
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX>: I'm all right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.</ENAMEX>, and it would be unfair to
complain about that; to learn that it was said to come
from a novel by Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Bone</ENAMEX> is not much of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">revelation</ENAMEX>, nor is it particularly exciting to learn that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Partridge</ENAMEX> thinks it arose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> as a minced
form of some taboo <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victorianism</ENAMEX> (if such things actually
existed).

            Much more entertaining is a slow browse
through the pages, which reveals items like this:


Book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">of Common Prayer, The</ENAMEX>

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1662</TIMEX> version

The quick and the dead.

In the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Apostles' Creed: From</ENAMEX> thence he [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX>]
shall come to judge the quick and the dead,
quick meaning alive.

To <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord Dewar</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1864-1930</TIMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">industrialist</ENAMEX>,
is credited the joke that there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX>
classes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pedestrians</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> of reckless
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor</ENAMEX> traffic--the quick, and the dead.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>
Robey ascribed it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dewar</ENAMEX> in Looking Back on
Life (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX>).  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> that same
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> merely <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ventured</ENAMEX>: The saying that there are
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sorts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pedestrians</ENAMEX>, the quick and the dead,
is well matured.

            

            I begin to cleave to the well-matured story, I'm
afraid; but it does have the advantage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, when
the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> demonstrate a total lack of
respect for tradition, of not being overworked by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comedians</ENAMEX> who rarely say anything funny or
even clever but make up their routines to remind us
of our foibles.  My foibles are very serious, indeed,
and are not anything to joke about.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> should be aware that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rees</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and
that the book has a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> leaning, less in the choice
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, perhaps, than in the inclusion of quotations
that are opaque to those who are not of the
British persuasion and in attributions to obscure <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Englishmen</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
Braham, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> and songwriter
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1774-1856</TIMEX>), for example.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Brewer's Quotations</ENAMEX> is simple:
the main text lists <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> in alphabetical order with
quotations following in alphabetical order by first
word; in a few cases, where several works are cited
from a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX>, the titles are in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alphabetical</ENAMEX> order with the quotations following.
On every page, the quotations are numbered sequentially,
providing a quick reference point for the
Index, which lists quotations by their key words, in
some cases listing them more than once: for example,
By their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits ye</ENAMEX> shall know them is listed in the
Index both under <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> and under know .  One criticism
focuses on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> of the book, over whom
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> (if not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Rees</ENAMEX>) should have
exercised some influence: in a book in which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">page</ENAMEX> numbers are an essential piece of the reference
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">apparatus</ENAMEX>, they should not be set in the center of the
bottom of the page, where they are hard to see
when thumbing through, but at the top, as close to
the foredge as possible.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brewer</ENAMEX>'s Quotations was originally published by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cassell</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>.  Other titles in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Brewer series</ENAMEX>, a

Slavic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s tumultuous history.  Words of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>
Slavonic origin mingle freely with a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> words--a legacy of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five hundred years</TIMEX> of
occupation--along with words from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Romany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanian</ENAMEX>,
Modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tatar</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Macedonian</ENAMEX>.  After <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bulgaria</ENAMEX>'s
close cultural ties with the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> ushered
in a large batch of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neologisms</ENAMEX>.

            Today <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bulgaria</ENAMEX>'s newest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> is opting for
radical new <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>-sounding words--
cool words that are kreizi crazy, fain fine,
bomba <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>, tiptop tiptop, shik chic, vuvelirno
jewellike, dzhust just, absolyutno absolutely, or
sadistichno sadistic.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late-night</TIMEX> bars, euphemistically known in student
slang as biblioteki <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bulgaria</ENAMEX>'s youth
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mixes</ENAMEX> and mingles, rapping in trendy new words.
The heavy-metal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> is the most radical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creator</ENAMEX> of
new terms.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sofia</ENAMEX>'s heavy-metal culture calls itself
metalurgiya metallurgy, and the heavy-metal aficionado
is known as a metalurg metallurgist, or
metal for short.

            As the tough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youths</ENAMEX> sit on bar stools eyeing the
passing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>, sexist labels proliferate.  An attractive
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">woman</ENAMEX> is a beibi <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>, bambina (from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>),
or bonbon (from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>).  Large breasts are
referred to as balkon balcony, or bombi bombs,
and a large bottom, curiously, as a diferenzial differential
(in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>).  (In some of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sofia</ENAMEX>'s slang <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, the
even stranger expression shvester --from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Schwester</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>--is preferred.)  A thin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> is
called an antena .  A rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who buys rounds of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> is known as a mangizlika , from the Romany
word mangis hard cash.

            On a rougher level, kushetka <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couch</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> couchette , is used pejoratively for a woman
who has many sexual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, and avantazhiya
(from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> word for advantage) implies that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> is looking to profit from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> she
attracts.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> always short of cash is known as
an aviatorka aviatrix: instead of being sensible with
her money, she is flying high.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX>, too, are slotted into neat categories.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gardrob</ENAMEX> (as in wardrobe) is the tough muscle<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-man</ENAMEX>.
A smooth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> is called klincher --a clincher.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> without any finesse are called buldozer .  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">droger</ENAMEX> is the male drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addict</ENAMEX>, drogerka the female.
(The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> they take are called vitamini ).

            
               Aborig√©n aborigine is the provincial who has
come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sofia</ENAMEX> for a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.  He is also
known as a kask√©t cap, as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> casquette , a
modern pun on kalp√°k fur cap, an offensive taunt to
out-of-towners that is of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> origin.  (These hat
expressions stem from the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bulgarian</ENAMEX> provincials
traditionally wear large home-made fur
caps.)

            Modern words for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual</ENAMEX> are pedi,
pederuga, and pedal (as in bicycle pedal).  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX>
developed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pede</ENAMEX> , a slangy contraction
of pederast , which was borrowed from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> by way of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coincidentally</ENAMEX>, modern
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">argot</ENAMEX> uses both pede and pedal in the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>.)  If, however, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual</ENAMEX> is particularly aggressive
and masculine-looking, he is called man√°f
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turk</ENAMEX> or its stronger derivative, manafchiya .

            A particularly interesting trait of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Bulgarian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slang</ENAMEX> is the astonishing array of rough words of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>
origin for idiot, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loser</ENAMEX>, asshole, etc.: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">abd√°l,</ENAMEX>
ahmak, b√°lama, balam√∫r, balam√∫rnik, bal√∫k, budal√°,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bun√°k</ENAMEX>, chir√°k, chukundur, dangal√°k, dangul, edepsizl√≠k,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">esn√°f</ENAMEX>, haidam√°k, hairs√∫s, haivan, haivanin, inatchiya,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kakavan√≠n</ENAMEX>, katran√≠k, kepaz√©, kusurl√≠ya, leke,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mand√°</ENAMEX>, maskar√°, pach√°, palamud, perdesis, rend√©,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sers√©m</ENAMEX>, and sersemin .

            Mixed in with this hefty portion of harsh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>
words is an ever-growing batch of newer Western
additions.  What are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bulgaria</ENAMEX>'s most in words in
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">'90s</NUMEX> for idiot and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loser</ENAMEX>?: striptiz uotur striptease
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, a curious reference to maladroit, foolish
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>; kretenozavur cretinosaurus; boiler
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> whose head is full of bubbling hot water; sifon
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">siphon</ENAMEX>, one whose head is like an empty tube;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bush√≥n</ENAMEX> fuse, from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> bouchon cork; diaria
diarrhea; loko from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loco</ENAMEX>; galosh as in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">galoshes</TIMEX>;
kash√≥n crate, from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> cassone; lainer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ocean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">liner</ENAMEX>, a pun on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Bulgarian</ENAMEX> word lain√≥
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scum</ENAMEX>.

         
         
            Up or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Down</ENAMEX> to You




            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robb Wilton</ENAMEX>, that acclaimed and dearly-loved
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comedian</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirties</TIMEX> and forties, introduced
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of his best wartime monologues with the
classic first lines,

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The day</TIMEX> war broke out, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> said to me,
It's up to you!

            I said, What is?

            If he had been writing the sketch <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, he would
probably have quoted his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> as saying, It's down
to you.  Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last forty years or so</TIMEX>, the expression
up to ... has been widely replaced by down to
... in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> usage.  It has been a quite unnecessary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transformation</ENAMEX>, and an unfortunate one because it
brings with it an inferior nuance.  Starting in less literate
circles as part of slipshod mod jargon, this
replacement has gradually been adopted more and
more widely.  It can now be noted in use by school
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">teachers</ENAMEX> (and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> of English at that), by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">university</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dons</ENAMEX>, and even by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> newsreaders and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX>.

            How has this departure come about?  It probably
has some association with social and moral
changes which, over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few decades</TIMEX>, have
brought increasingly churlish and irresponsible attitudes.
Up to ... conveys a sense of duty, of looking
up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> concerned, with confidence
in their integrity.  Down to ... brings a sense
of looking downwards to them, somewhat disparagingly,
and blaming them.  No longer does a difficult
situation arise and the question immediately follow
Who's this up to?--meaning, Who will unquestionably
regard it as his/her responsibility to sort the
matter out?  Rather is it now an immediate question
of Who's this down to?--meaning, Who can be
found to blame, so that the job of correction can be
quickly thrust down to them, leaving others untouched
and unassailable.

            Does it really matter?  Or is it just part of the
continuous evolution of our rich and living language?
Surely, careful consideration leads to the
conclusion that it does matter and that the change
should be deplored.  Why?  Because a perfectly good
phrase suggesting honourable obligation or moral
duty has been replaced by an inferior one implying a
bureaucratic, regulatory responsibility, and even
perhaps litigation and punishment.

            Let us try to retain up to ..., using it whenever
it may be appropriate; then down to ... may once
again be confined to its proper contexts.
         
         
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourth</ENAMEX> Use of the Verb
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rodomontade</ENAMEX> in the Eighteenth
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Century</ENAMEX>




            Under the rubric for the verb rodomantade in
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> edition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> finds a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio</ENAMEX> of
examples from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the eighteenth century</TIMEX>.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is
from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Johnson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755</TIMEX>) which informs
us of its meaning to brag thrasonically; to
boast like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodomonte</ENAMEX>.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> citations
are found in the works of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fanny Burney</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s circle.  In both her Cecilia
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">1782) and Diary</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1787</TIMEX>), we see the verb functioning
as a gerund.  In the former work, we read
there's nothing to be got by rhodomontading,
and in the latter, I think his rhodomontading as innocent
as that of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX>.

            Evidence for the presence of the word on the
other side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> has been limited heretofore
to a single <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> example.  In this particular
instance the verb is employed as a present participle
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Irving</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life & Letters</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1831</TIMEX>)
to describe his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> a rodomontading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Congressman</ENAMEX>
from the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>.  There is, however, another
ocourrence of rodomontade about fifty years
earlier, in the writing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Adams</ENAMEX>. In a letter to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elbridge Gerry</ENAMEX>, written from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Braintree</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 October 1779</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX> described the tactics
he had tried to use in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> to avoid political queries
made by an insistent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Izard</ENAMEX>: At Sometimes
[ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ] I endeavoured to perswade [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ] him to excuse
me, at others I rhodomontaded it, with him, and endeavoured
to divert him from it ...   Exactly how
the word entered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX>'s vocabulary is not known.
The verb probably came to his attention through
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX> , with which both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX> and
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Abigail</ENAMEX>, were familiar.  Nevertheless,
while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> remains obscure, his application
of it does no longer.
            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, the noun rodomontade ,
spelled rhodomontade, appears in the autobiography of Catharine
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Sedgwick</ENAMEX>, whose work dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1853</TIMEX>.  See The
Power of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Her Sympathy , ed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Kelley</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>.  I am

prefer to be called niggers to distinguish themselves
from the despised suburban upwardly mobile
