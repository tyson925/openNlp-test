            The diary that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Pepys</ENAMEX> kept from the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day of 1660</TIMEX> till he thought he was losing his
eyesight <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight and a half years later</TIMEX> can tell us a lot
about how the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language has changed or remained
more or less constant over the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> and a
half <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>.  There may be other sources equally
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX> in examples for comparison, but there can hardly
be another that is at the same time so much fun to read
and accessible.  Moreover, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Restoration</ENAMEX> period
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pepys</ENAMEX> kept his diary is a good time to compare
with ours, because by then the basis of modern English
had been laid down by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elizabethans</ENAMEX>.

            For a mechanical and therefore objective lexical
comparison I did a spelling check with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Q&A</ENAMEX> software
on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> paragraphs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 7</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, cover story on anchor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diane Sawyer</ENAMEX>
and on the slightly longer first entry in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pepys</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diary</ENAMEX> ,
dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 1660</TIMEX>.  Except for proper
names, the spelling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">checker</ENAMEX> stopped on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> paragraphs that were not in its lexicon:
show- biz and credentialed .  Likewise <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepys</ENAMEX>'s entry gave pause to the checker, though
they are not so much lost words as obsolete forms of
words: hath and doth .  I should add that where Pepys
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phonetically</ENAMEX> wrote then he meant than and that he
used the adjective handsome to describe his financial
condition, as we would rarely do today.  Nevertheless,
the spelling-check test provides some indication
that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vocabulary</ENAMEX> has not discarded as
many words over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three centuries</TIMEX> as one
might expect.  Our vocabulary has rather been
swollen by these centuries of technological breakthroughs
and social and political revolutions.

            Though such words as betimes and whither and
such forms as doth and hath have dropped out of
ordinary usage, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s English-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> of
average education can read most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Diary</ENAMEX> without
encountering any word that would send him to
his dictionary.  In fact, so rapidly does our vocabulary
continue to expand by the addition of such technical
neologisms as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> or star wars and such borrowings
as zaftig and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ayatollah</ENAMEX> that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> of our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">day</ENAMEX> could well be more taxed to know the meanings
of all the words in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> than to
understand all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diary</ENAMEX> .

            Besides the lexicon, grammar--especially syntax--has
changed somewhat, too, though again not
so much as to be incomprehensible to the average
modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>.  On the one hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepys</ENAMEX>'s English
may seem slightly stilted or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biblical</ENAMEX> by modern standards,
with frequent absolute constructions and the
use of do as an auxiliary for affirmative verbs where
no emphasis is intended, as, for example, in his entry
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 31, 1662</TIMEX>, where he thanks ‚ÄúAlmighty
God, who doth most manifestly bless me in my endeavors
to do the duty of my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>--I now saving
money, and my expenses being very little.‚Äù  This casual
use of the auxiliary do seems to be creeping back
into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> usage, especially among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waiters</ENAMEX> for
some reason, who are increasingly wont to announce,
‚ÄúAs the catch of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, we do have red
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">snapper</ENAMEX>....<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Ordinarily</ENAMEX>, though, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
speech the auxiliary do is reserved for negative or
interrogative statements as in Don't do it or Do you
do it?  or for emphasis, particularly in rebuttal, as in
But I do do it !  We have gained a handy distinction
here.  On the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepys</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, while familiar
enough to us, may sound slightly nonstandard,
as where past-tense forms and past participles are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coalesced</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pepys</ENAMEX> writes, just as we might say but
ought not write, ‚Äú... running up and down...
with their arses bare... being beat by the watch.‚Äù
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 23, 1668</TIMEX>)

            The progressive tense occurs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pepys</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diary</ENAMEX> ,
as for example in his entry for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 3, 1665</TIMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúShe</ENAMEX> was dressing herself by the fire...and there
took occasion to show me her leg‚Äù; but he uses it
much less than we do.  For us it has practically replaced
the future tense, as when we say, ‚ÄúI'm going
to town <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Contractions</ENAMEX> are even rarer in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Diary</ENAMEX> but do occur, for example in his entry for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 9, 1667</TIMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúSays that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knepp</ENAMEX> won't take
pains enough...‚Äù

            More surprising than evident but relatively insignificant
differences between the language in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepys's Diary</ENAMEX> and our everyday language are the
words and expressions that have persisted in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than three centuries</TIMEX> without having ever
gained full acceptance.  For instance, take I when
compounded with another pronoun or a noun in the
objective case, as in: Between you and I ....  Even
educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> nowadays often use I in combinations
where me is prescribed.  There is an academic
legend that this solecism is a hypercorrection forced
into our <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of
schoolmarms pounded into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of generations
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolchildren</ENAMEX> that they must not say me in such
combinations as me and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny</ENAMEX> done it .  Not so.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel</ENAMEX>
Pepys, never confused by an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolmarm</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">invariably</ENAMEX>, so far as I have found, used I instead
of me when the pronoun was combined with
another pronoun or noun as the object of a verb or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preposition</ENAMEX>.  To cite a few examples: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äú... did take
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and I to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Queenes</ENAMEX> presence-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chamber</ENAMEX>
...<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 22, 1660</TIMEX>); ‚Äú... who pleased my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and I ...‚Äù (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 27, 1660</TIMEX>); ‚Äú... Mrs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah</ENAMEX> talking with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I...‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 20</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1663</TIMEX>); ‚Äú... if God send my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and I to live ...‚Äù
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 8, 1667</TIMEX>); and ‚ÄúThis <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> up, with mighty
kind words between my poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 1668</TIMEX>).  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepys</ENAMEX> does not use they and its inflected
forms as an indefinite singular pronoun
nearly as commonly as we do in such constructions
as ‚ÄúEveryone on their feet!‚Äù, but in his entry for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 20, 1668</TIMEX>, he writes ‚Äú... everybody endeavouring
to excuse themselfs.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  And</ENAMEX> in his entry
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 14, 1667</TIMEX>, we find ‚Äú... till they send
for me‚Äù where the subject is no one in particular.
Similarly, who in the objective case appears to have
been on the threshold of acceptance into standard
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than three hundred years</TIMEX>.  Pepys
repeatedly uses the pronoun so, for instance: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äú...
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burroughs</ENAMEX>, who I took in and drank with‚Äù (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 6</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1667</TIMEX>).  However, in his entry for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 7, 1668</TIMEX>, we
find: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äú... whom I was pleased with all <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>....
‚ÄùAs for lay for lie , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of usage has by now
almost won acceptance into the standard language,
we find in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pepys</ENAMEX>'s entry for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 22, 1667</TIMEX>:
‚Äú... found not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> on board her [a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>] (and her
laying so near them was a main temptation to them
to come on).<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX>  (Compare this with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kipling</ENAMEX>'s ‚ÄúWhere
the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Flotilla lay‚</ENAMEX>Äù where lay is the past tense of
lie .)

            There are also in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pepys</ENAMEX>'s Diary words and
phrases that have been admitted to our standard language
but that still sound a bit colloquial.  This is me,
which we find in his entry for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 31, 1667</TIMEX>, has
finally been accepted into standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, though
it took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three centuries</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston Churchill</ENAMEX>'s fiat
to do it.  When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pepys</ENAMEX> writes mad, usually he means
angry, just as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> do today: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äú... which
makes our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> mad‚Äù (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 9, 1664</TIMEX>).  Telling
of annoyances on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 10, 1667</TIMEX>, he twice
writes: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äú... which did make me mad,‚Äù as well as:
‚ÄúI begun heartily to sweat and be angry <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">...‚Äù Today</ENAMEX>
this meaning of mad is more at home in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
than in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British English</ENAMEX>.  The same can be said of certain
other of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepys</ENAMEX>'s locutions, for example the past
participle gotten instead of got: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äú... who were by
this time gotten most of them drunk‚Äù (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1666</TIMEX>).

            In general, one tends to find confirmed in the
language of the Diary the relative conservatism of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> as contrasted with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>.
So far as dialects are concerned, I know British
dialects too little to say.  But there is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Diary a</ENAMEX>
locution that I have encountered only there, I believe
in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>, and commonly, though less
and less, in the speech of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>: like(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>)
to ... as in ‚ÄúThat ol' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> like to of killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hisself‚</NUMEX>Äù or
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pepys</ENAMEX>'s entry for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 14, 1660</TIMEX>:‚Äú... the purser
... had like to have been drowned had it not been
for a rope.‚Äù

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the three hundred years</TIMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepys</ENAMEX> the general
drift of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> has been towards a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> kind
of grammer with loss and confusion of inflection and
with phrases used as words.  A carelessness about inflection
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pepys</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> is shown above with the examples
of the objective I and who .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rarer</ENAMEX> back then
was the use of whole phrases as single words as, for
instance: to quickly and efficiently do this job, where
the verb and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adverbs</ENAMEX> are treated together as a
so-called split infinitive marked by to, instead of the
prescribed to do this job quickly and efficiently,
where only do is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">infinitive</ENAMEX> marked as such by to
and modified by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> adverbs.  So it comes as something
of a surprise to find a clause in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1662 Diary</ENAMEX>
that sounds like wording in a television commercial:
‚ÄúI saw the so much by me desired picture of my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady Castlemayne</ENAMEX>....<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 20</TIMEX>).  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepys</ENAMEX> also
has a tendency to omit subject pronouns, reminding
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of television commercials: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúHad a bowl of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whamo</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX>.  Feel great!‚Äù a trim, muscular
type in a TV commercial might exclaim, sounding
rather like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pepys</ENAMEX> when he wrote over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three centuries</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>, ‚ÄúDined with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephens...‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 3</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1660</TIMEX>) or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúLay long in bed...‚Äù (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 15, 1660</TIMEX>).

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepys's Diary</ENAMEX> owes its eventual status as a classic
to its candor and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s privileged position
as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Restoration England</ENAMEX>.  But he did
have a style of his own that should be taken into
consideration in any evaluation of the language of
his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Diary</ENAMEX> .  His <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, as suits the dairy of so exuberant
and impatient a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and a stenographer
among other things, strikes us as almost telegraphic
in its compression.  It is doubtful that in conversation
he would ever remark, ‚ÄúUp early ...‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúUp betimes...,‚Äù
the phrases with which he so often begins
his dairy entries.  But allowing that the language
is well adapted to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stenographer</ENAMEX>'s very private diary
and of its particular time and place, we find little
that is obscurely archaic in its style.  Despite such
interesting differences as are noted above, the language
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepys</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>, however dated, is not generically
unlike what we might expect to find in a
secret <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> kept by a yuppie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrat</ENAMEX> of our
times.

‚Äú... <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> is up.  I'm sorry.  You lose.‚Äù

            What happended?  The unfortunate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contestant</ENAMEX>
simply knew his physics and philosophy,
and recall was immediate.  Since there is no logic to
the lengths of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, he had facilitated memory of
them with a mnemonic device.  Before the answer
could be given, he had to summon up a variation on
the venerable theme--


<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thirty days</TIMEX> hath <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April, June</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>;
All the rest have thirty-one,
Excepting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> alone,
And that has <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-eight days</TIMEX> clear
And <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> in each leap year.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stevins MS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c. 1555</ENAMEX>), quoted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Quotations, 3rd, ed.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford Univ</ENAMEX>. Press, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>.
            

            --and time expired while the verse was internally
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recited</ENAMEX>.

            My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, probably to be difficult, points out a
visual mnemonic for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX> lengths--something involving
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">knuckles</ENAMEX>.  Indeed, visual mnemonics were
used by classical orators so they could speak without
notes.  Points to be made were assigned to various
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loci</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> then mentally toured
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> while delivering the speech.  Our use
of ‚Äúin the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, etc.) place‚Äù is an offshoot of
this method.  Because this is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúThe Language Quarterly</ENAMEX>,‚Äù
further discussion will be limited to mnemonics
using language.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mnemonics</ENAMEX> actually are codes for associated,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> facts.  Their techniques of encryption may
be divided into: reduction coding, which minimizes
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> to be stored (e.g., acronyms: reducing words
to single letters); and elaboration coding, which
strengthens weakly linked memory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> by
adding material (e.g., rhymes, and epi-acronyms: in
which initial letters of words in phrases are the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">code</ENAMEX>).  Having a mnemonic is no panacea.  For example,
to recover the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX> one must first remember
a mnemonic (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HOMES</ENAMEX>, or, going west to east,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúSergeant- M ajor H ates E ating O nions‚Äù</ENAMEX> ), and then
decrypt it.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huron</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Erie</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Superior</ENAMEX> are nowhere in the brain, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HOMES</ENAMEX> will
not put them there.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poetry</ENAMEX> is an ancient mnemonic device.  The Biblical
psalmist undoubtedly used the combination of
the verse form and an abecedarius to remember
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Psalm 119</ENAMEX>, each of whose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> octaves begins
with a successive letter of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hebrew</ENAMEX> alphabet.
Though it is no <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iliad</ENAMEX> , all young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spellers</ENAMEX> know the
rhyme mnemonic

            so well that they are destined chronically to misspell
seizure .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogden Nash</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orthographist</ENAMEX>'s mnemonic, of
more limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>, at least has no exceptions--

            Instead, I proceeded to that hotbed of mnemonics,
medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>.  [I wish to assure non-physician
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> do not, as a rule, think of

            It is the consensus of mnemonists that the more

the mnemonic.  How can one forget <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohm</ENAMEX>'s

            Even the best mnemonics are not free of drawbacks.

            Worse is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-recalled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mnemonic</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> may

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finesse</ENAMEX>--against the king, or against the queen--to
which the rule applies.

            Can we ever discard a good, though unnecessary,
mnemonic, or are we forever doomed to have

            We collect and preserve mnemonics, however
redundant, as insurance against embarrassing lapsus
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">memoriae</ENAMEX> .  They are not foolproof.  According to Sir
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Coke</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄúIt is ... necessary that memorable

            Stuff and Nonsense



            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the wonders of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language is
that it contains so many words about words
themselves.  Among the most colorful and intriguing
are those that describe the piffle, prattle, twaddle,
and flapdoodle that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in all talks of life tend to
spew forth.  Here is a small start on a glossary of glossolalia,
a demidictionary of drivel that lists the varieties
of verbal obfuscation and explains the etymologies
of these often playful terms.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applesauce</ENAMEX> (an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> variant is apple <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">sass</ENAMEX> ),
which has come to designate a `camouflage of flattery,'
is excessively sweet, mushy, pulpy and insubstantial,
and thrifty boarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> serve an abundance
of the stuff to divert awareness from the
scarcity of more nourishing fare.  A similar connection
is made between senseless banter and baloney,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eponymously</TIMEX> descended from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bologna</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> turned out a type of sausage
crammed with odds and ends from slaughter, including,
some say, assmeat.  It is but a short step from the
cheapest ground cold cuts to cheap talk, and the
same steps takes up from tripe, the walks of the first
and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> stomachs of ruminants,' to `worthless,
foolish speech.'  Adding to the pile of verbal garbage
is balderdash, which reaches back to the late 16th
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> and originally meant a `hodgepodge of liquors,
such as wine mixed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>,' perfect for
washing down a mishmash of pretentious and frivolous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blather</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosh</ENAMEX> looks as typically <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> as balderdash,
yet it actually descends from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>
adjective bos `empty, useless.'  The word became
popular in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 19th century</TIMEX>
through the oriental romances and memories of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James</ENAMEX>
Morier, who enhanced his exotic tales with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>
terms.

            Spook etymology misinforms us that babble is a
Biblical reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Genesis 11.17</ENAMEX>, in which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Babel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Babylon</ENAMEX>) built a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> reaching to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heaven</ENAMEX> and incited God to confound their language.
The less romantic truth is that babble descends from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle English</ENAMEX> babelon and is probably of imitative
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">origin</ENAMEX>, echoing the ba ba sounds typically made
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> in their repetitive chatter.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blarney</ENAMEX> and
bunk, on the other hand, do hail from the names of
actual places.  Blarney refers to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blarney stone</ENAMEX>,
located in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blarney Castle</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few miles</NUMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cork</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX>.  Those who kiss the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blarney stone</ENAMEX> are reputed
to be able to charm the pants off everyone
ever after.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bunk</ENAMEX> is a shortening of bunkum, itself a
respelling for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buncomber County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>,
whose congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> once remarked
that he was ‚Äúonly talking for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buncombe</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            
               Claptrap turns out to be a show biz metaphor
for high-sounding but empty language.  The word
was originally a theatrical term for a showy trick or
patch of high-flown, grandiose language that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX>
would use to attract (`trap') applause (`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">claps</ENAMEX>') from
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX>.  Another rhyming reduplication,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mumbo</ENAMEX> jumbo, is probably borrowed from a word in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> Mandingo: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mama Dyumbo</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deity</ENAMEX> who
helped <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX> to bewilder <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> whom they suspected
of talking too much.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cowper</ENAMEX> once wrote ‚Äúphilologists
who trace<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">panting</ENAMEX> syllable through time and
space,/Start it at home, and hunt it in the dark/To
Gaul, to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>, and into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noah</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ark.‚Äù  Almost</ENAMEX> always,
an etymological safari into any subject bags at
least a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.  A cock and bull story, for example,
derives from ancient fables and medieval bestiaries
in which cocks moralized, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bulls expostulated</ENAMEX>,
and a menagerie of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> discoursed in human
language.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cockamamie</ENAMEX> has nothing whatever to
do with roosters, talking or otherwise.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, fashionable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> applied increasingly
elaborate beauty spots to their upper cheeks.  This
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">craze</ENAMEX> became known as d√©calcomanie, from d√©calc-
(from d√©calquer `transfer a tracing' + - o - + manie
`mania,' whence we get decalcomania ( decal for
short for the transfers), and the adjective cockamamie
some say echoes the sense of florid but superficial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embellishment</ENAMEX>.  Hogwash, of course, is a designation
for language as `worthless, disgusting, and unfit
for human consumption, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig slops</ENAMEX>.'

            Puffy, bureaucratic verbiage if often called gobbledygook,
a word credited to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maury Maverick</ENAMEX>, who compared the tortuous (and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">torturous</ENAMEX>) prose of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> to the
senseless gobbling of turkeys.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maverick</ENAMEX> made the
word famous with a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> memorandum denouncing
the bloated language found in government
reports: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúBe short and say what you're talking
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX>.  Stop `pointing up' programs.  No more `finalizing,'
`effectuating,' or `dynamics.'  Anyone caught
using the words `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX>' or `implementation' will
be shot.‚Äù  Closely related to gobbledygook, but more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">malicious</ENAMEX>, is doublespeak .  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>, the National
Council of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teachers</ENAMEX> of English established a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX>
on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Doublespeak</ENAMEX> to help identify and
stamp out evasive and obfuscating terminology slithering
out of public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, such as ‚Äúuncontrolled
contact with the ground‚Äù for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúairplane crash‚Äù</ENAMEX> and
‚Äúinoperative statement‚Äù for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúlie</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Doublespeak</ENAMEX> is a
blending of Double-talk and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Newspeak</ENAMEX>, the insidious
language of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Orwell</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nineteen Eighty-Four</ENAMEX> .

            A number of loopily echoic words resonate with
the nonsense of non-sense.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Folderol</ENAMEX> (or falderal ) is
drawn from the meaningless syllables sung in the refrains
of many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">folksongs</ENAMEX>, ‚Äúfol-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de-rol-deray</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
Tommyrot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds tommy</ENAMEX>, `simpleton, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool</ENAMEX>'
(as in tomfoolery ) and rot, `worthless matter.'  In his
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Browser</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Ciardi</ENAMEX> suggests
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">that ‚Äú tommy</ENAMEX> is a variant of tummy, the sense shift
having been from `stomach garbage' to `brain garbage.'
‚Äù  And poppycock comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pappekak</ENAMEX>,
literally `soft poop' or `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby poop</ENAMEX>,' an appropriately
scatological etymology for logorrhea.

            That we have been able to come up with so
many words to describe forked-tongued and muddle-headed
language indicates that we may one day
not just speak but communicate.  That we have been
so intelligent about identifying unintelligible persiflage
gives hope that we may learn not just to talk
but to say something.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communication Ravine</ENAMEX>



            For nearly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years</TIMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and I worked
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Papua New Guinea</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> in a church
school.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Call us ‚Äúmissionaries‚Äù</ENAMEX> to make it simple.)  Of
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">750</NUMEX> different languages in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, we
learned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.  One was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melanesian Pidgin</ENAMEX>, which, besides
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hiri Motu</ENAMEX>, is one of the official
languages of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> language we
learned was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K√¢te</ENAMEX> (pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">kaw-tay</ENAMEX>), an area language
spoken by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only several thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.  Living
and working overseas with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of another
culture and language made us realize how complicated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> can be.

            Speech is the most obvious form of communication.
But using speech to communicate is more than
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúI</ENAMEX> said,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù ‚Äúhe</ENAMEX> said,‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúthey said.‚Äù  Sometimes the
words we use are the sounds of the communicating:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">whispering</ENAMEX>, cackling, prattling, chuckling, chortling,
mumbling, grumbling.  Other words suggest motives
behind the speech: lying, gossiping, negotiating,
plotting.  Speech is certainly more than plugging in
vocabulary words to express a thought.  We had to
learn nuances of meaning which were not found in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionaries</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Pidgin</ENAMEX> word tok by itself means ‚Äútalk‚Äù and
its synonyms, in both verb and noun forms.  Whereas
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> there are totally different words to express
different aspects of speech, the word tok combines
with other words to define various kinds of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>: tokaut `speak out,' tok baksait `gossip,'
toktok `converse,' tok mama `advise,' tok hait
`secret,' tok tru `truth,' tok nogut `foul language,' tok
giaman `lying,' tok pait `argue,' tok ples `local language,'
tok tasol `idea,' tok nating `nonsense,' tok isi
`comfort,' tok pani `joke,' tok strong `emphasize.'

            Voice intonation and body language complicate
the communication process further.  Using no words
at all, you can express joy, sorrow, anger, disgust,
skepticism, ridicule, criticism, fear, and many other
emotions.  Tone of voice, facial expressions, placement
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>, and body stance all contribute to nonverbal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> of feelings.  In practical terms,
we had to learn not only to choose our words very
carefully, but to be aware of what we said in nonverbal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX>.  We occasionally used in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù
language for discussion or making decisions when
there were no <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> around.  We were
aware that they were reading the cues of intonation
and body language to get an idea about how the discussion
was going.  We only hoped they would not
misread the cues.  We, too, tried to read their nonverbal
cues when they spoke too quickly for us to
understand or when they used an uncommon language
with which they alone were familiar.

            There can be, however, a danger in relying on a
language for secrecy.  One missionary told of the
time his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> went home to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> on furlough.
Their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> did not realize others spoke <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>,
but rather thought it was their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>'s personal, private
language.  So one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, standing in a
customs line in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>, shouted, ‚ÄúLook, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX>, see
that great big FAT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>!?‚Äù

            Even if you become skilled at controlling nonverbal
means of communication, there are still other
cultural assumptions and traditions you cannot know
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> without proper briefing.  We had heard from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> ways
of doing things may be insulting to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationals</ENAMEX>.  In
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, for example, it is a great insult to offer your
left hand in any way, even handing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> your
money to pay for something.  The left hand is considered
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúdirty‚Äù hand</ENAMEX>, the right hand the ‚Äúclean‚Äù
hand.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX>, showing the bottom of your foot
is an insult.  This sounds easy enough to avoid until
you consider how many times you cross your legs
when sitting at meetings, on a bus, or in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Papua New Guinea</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">PNG</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> hiss and
boo at other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who step across rows of food
spread on the ground at the marketplace, for women
are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúunclean‚Äù</ENAMEX> and must take proper steps to insure
the purity of the food being handled.  Even symbolic
contamination is taken very seriously.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Boys</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of
the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> refused to eat the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> prepared for
their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX>: because one of them had seen some girls
sitting on the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bales</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> stacked in the school pantry,
they considered the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice unclean</ENAMEX> and therefore
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inedible</ENAMEX>.

            Much of what is appropriate in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is
not in another, and vice versa.  In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> the first
questions we ask small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with whom we are
confronted are: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúWhat</ENAMEX>'s your name<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">?‚Äù</ENAMEX>  and ‚ÄúHow old
are you?‚Äù  In PNG those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> questions are the wrong
questions to ask.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> question is inappropriate
because names are private.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> believe that
evil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spirits</ENAMEX> can control you if they know your name.
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Papua New Guineans</ENAMEX>, therefore, have several
extra names, depending on who needs to know
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>).  But they have one
private, hidden name which remains a family secret.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> question, ‚ÄúHow old are you?‚Äù  is one
which might get you a puzzled look or a blank stare.
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, and nearly all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, neither know
nor care when they were born.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> might be
able to tell you, ‚ÄúNow let's see...she was born the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> we had that big flood.‚Äù  But as a practical consideration,
age in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> has nothing to do with anything.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> go to school when the parents and
village <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elders</ENAMEX> feel they are ready for it.  The passing
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> of one's life is celebrated generally for
everyone as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> finishes and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the New Year</TIMEX>
arrives.  The language even reflects this, for the Pidgin
word for `birthday' is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krismas</ENAMEX>.  Besides, their
concept of time is circular, not linear, so marking the
passage of time is not as important as celebrating the
return of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonal</TIMEX> events.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phrase ‚Äúcommunication gap‚Äù</ENAMEX> takes on new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meanings</ENAMEX> in another culture.  Our views about how
well we are communicating are often misleading; a
better phrase might be <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúcommunication ravine</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
There is a classic case (and true, we are told) of a
misunderstanding between a missionary and his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cook</ENAMEX>.  The missionary told the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> what to prepare
for dinner: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúGo out and catch that old rooster, pluck
it, and put it in the refrigerator.  We'll cook it later.‚Äù
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Several hours later</TIMEX> the missionary opened the refrigerator
door only to find one very angry, naked
rooster staring at him: he hadn't told the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> to kill
it <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>.  Meanwhile, what do you suppose the cook
told his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> when they asked why he
was so tattered and scratched: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúYou'll never guess
what that crazy missionary asked me to do today!‚Äù

            Symbols are still another form of communication.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Drivers</ENAMEX> use symbols all the time to know how
and where to drive.  <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic games</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
must identify symbols in order to find everything
from locker <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telex</ENAMEX> machines.  Despite the
growing use of internationally recognized symbols,
each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> has its own unique cultural and artistic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">symbols</ENAMEX>, which are baffling to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsiders</ENAMEX>.  Many
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Papua New Guineans</ENAMEX> can look at the face of another
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Papua New Guinean</ENAMEX>--on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> or in a picture
book--and tell you which part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is from.  They know by style of face-painting
and headdress where a singsing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX> is from, and
they can look at designs on carvings or woven string
bags and say where the work originated.  Many of
these designs and symbols tell stories of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,
and have meanings which are unknown to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Westerners</ENAMEX>.

            One missionary, who for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> had lived and
worked in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north coast</ENAMEX>, told us of one
enormous mistake made for just that reason.  A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of expatriate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> was called in to design
and build a high school.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> decided that
the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would like the school better if it had
designs with which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were familiar.  So
they chose from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äústory board‚Äù</ENAMEX> (an elaborate carving
showing the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in that area) a
symbol which was--to them--abstract.  This symbol
became the logo for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, and was used on
everything from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> letterhead to the sign in
front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>.  When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> opened, none
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> came.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> were baffled
and asked for advice from this long-time missionary.
He took the problem back to the local village <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elders</ENAMEX>,
who explained why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> was being boycotted:
the logo chosen was from that part of the village
history which described an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> arriving to rape
all the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX>.  That symbol was
the most repugnant part of their whole history, and
it was an embarrassment to have it plastered on signs
and papers all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.  To Westerners, it was a
‚Äúneat‚Äù design; to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, it was a symbol of
great shame.

            Conversely, we saw T-shirts imported, bought,
and worn by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who had no idea what the symbols
or words meant.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> wore a shirt
with ‚ÄúMILK MILK‚Äù printed on it corresponding to
the appropriate part of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">anatomy</ENAMEX> beneath the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shirt</ENAMEX>.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> elder who stood up to read the lesson
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church service</ENAMEX> wore a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shirt</ENAMEX> that read ‚ÄúI do
it <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX>.‚Äù  Even had they known <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, milk
would seem a tame enough word; and it might likely
refer to something as innocent as brushing one's
teeth or going to sleep.

            Being a native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> is still not enough in the
game of communication.  Because of historical, political,
and economic ties between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Papua</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Guinea</ENAMEX>, there are many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australians</ENAMEX> living and
working in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PNG</ENAMEX>, and many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Papua New Guineans</ENAMEX>
who learn <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australians</ENAMEX> speak it.  So in shops
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> we encountered
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, but not as we were accustomed to hearing it
spoken.  What would you buy if your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> gave
you a shopping list asking for ‚Äúcapsicum, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver beet</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mince</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">jelly?‚Äù</ENAMEX>  (She would expect green peppers,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> chard, hamburger, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jell-O</ENAMEX>.)  Or what
if she offered your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúcordial‚Äù</ENAMEX>?  (All she would
be giving him is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kool</ENAMEX>-Aid.)  Or what would you think
if the gentleman down the street said, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúWhat a</ENAMEX>
lovely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>!  May I nurse him?‚Äù  (He would only be
asking to hold the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>.)  If you were invited out for
‚Äúsupper‚Äù your hostess would serve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>,
while an invitation to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äútea‚Äù would be for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>
meal.

            Translating can be a treacherous means of communication,
too.  Although we did not translate more
than our own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> notes or study materials for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, we could sympathize with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> whose
sole job was translation.  Literal translations have
been troublesome to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biblical</ENAMEX> phrase, ‚ÄúYour sins were as <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">scarlet</ENAMEX>;
they shall be white as snow‚Äù simply does not work.
Red is the color for weddings and celebrations;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">white</ENAMEX> is the color of death and mourning.  Interestingly,
the word for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúwhite‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>] and ‚Äúcorpse‚Äù
are nearly identical in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">K√¢te language</ENAMEX>: qangqang
and \?<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">\√¢ng</ENAMEX> \?<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">\√¢ng</ENAMEX>, respectively.

            

            Key words presented some of the worst
problems.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúGrace‚Äù</ENAMEX> is almost impossible to translate
because their cultural assumptions allow no possibility
for a truly free gift.  There is a basic suspicion that
no kind of gift, earthly or heavenly, can possibly
come without strings attached.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K√</ENAMEX>¢te words
mang jaung (literally `care from the heart/belly') are
not too bad a translation for `love.'  However, there
are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> possibilities for translating `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">love' in Pidgin</ENAMEX>,
neither of which is satisfactory.  One is laikim, as
in ‚ÄúI love (i.e., `like') cucumbers.‚Äù  The other is
givim bel, which literally means `give the heart/
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">belly</ENAMEX>,' but which commonly means `to make pregnant.‚Äù
Believe it or not, it is the latter phrase which
has been chosen to translate the word `love' as found
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>.  Those sorts of translation difficulties
leave room for a lot of explaining!

            While we worked in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Papua New Guinea</ENAMEX> the
chances for miscommunication were myriad.  Hard
work, combined with luck, eventually bridged the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ravines</ENAMEX>.  We derived great pleasure from attempting
to unravel the languages and their cultures, and we
found that the desire to understand and to be understood
comes early in life, remains long, and seems to
be universal.
            The difference between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways of writing the ‚Äúq‚Äù
reflects a slight variation in pronunciation: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúq‚</ENAMEX>Äù being an explosive
kp sound, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äú\</ENAMEX>?\‚Äù being a voiced gb sound.
         
         
            Don't <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Get Your Titles In A Twist</ENAMEX>!



            I don't know about you, but I tend to get a touch
irritated by book titles, encountered in the media
and elsewhere, that seem slightly ‚Äúdeviant.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Deviant</ENAMEX>,
that is, from standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, or from what
one is expecting.  Some titles are catchy, and easy to
remember, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.G. Well</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kipps</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1905</TIMEX>), or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paul</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theroux</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Old Patagonian Express</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>), and
some are less memorable, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Moor</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX>'s
Tales of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mystery and Romance</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>), or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carlyle</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic</ENAMEX>
in History (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1841</TIMEX>).  But at least they are reasonably
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">straightforward</ENAMEX> and comprehensible.

            What I am getting at are titles with skew spellings,
rogue punctuation, and ‚Äúweird and wonderful‚Äù
names and words that are difficult to relate to anything
meaningful.

            Why, for example, does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Chatwin</ENAMEX>'s highly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">readable</ENAMEX> collection of anecdotes and aper√ßus, What
Am I doing Here (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>), have no question mark?  Or
come to that, why didn't he call it What I Am Doing
Here?  What is the significance, if any, of this small
deviation from the norm?  And what was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to</TIMEX>, calling his novel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pet Semetary</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>)?
Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garrison Keillor</ENAMEX>'s lovely <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lake Wobegon Days</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>) had me worried.  Why should I make an extra
effort to remember that the name of the ‚Äú1001st
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">lake</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX>,‚Äù as he describes it, is a twisted
version of woebegone?  The trouble with such ‚Äúoff‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spellings</ENAMEX> and punctuations is that you really need to
remember <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> extra things, on top of the little itself:
first, that the title is ‚Äúdeviant,‚Äù and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, how it is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deviant</ENAMEX>.

            However, the fact remains that all through literrary
titles in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> there are such irritants, and I
thought I might as well tackle the issue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> on and
see where the longstanding and popularly perpetrated
snags lay.  I offer my findings in the hopes that
fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> and media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> will be able to
see some light in this particular thicket, as I think I
can myself discern now.

            Let us take the matter of name spellings <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>,
whether personal names or place names, real names
or fictitious ones.  Here are some classics: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smollett</ENAMEX>'s
novel is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphry Clinker</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1771</TIMEX>), not ‚ÄúHumphrey‚Äù;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Richardson's</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarissa Harlowe</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1748</TIMEX>), not ‚ÄúHarlow‚Äù;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defoe's</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson Crusoe</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1719</TIMEX>), not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúCruso‚Äù; Rider Haggard's</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allan Quatermain</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1887</TIMEX>), not ‚ÄúQuartermain‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúQuatermaine.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX>  (A
slap on the wrist here to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Rose Ben√©t</ENAMEX>'s The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reader</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Encyclopedia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth McLeish</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bloomsbury Good Reading Guide</ENAMEX>, which respectively
give the latter misspellings.)  Also in this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>, I would say, are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emily Bront√</ENAMEX>´'s Wuthering
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Heights</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1846</TIMEX>), not ‚ÄúWeathering,<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äù ‚ÄúWithering,‚Äù</ENAMEX> or
any similar fancy, and, admittedly more trickily, Aldous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huxley</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crome Yellow</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1921</TIMEX>), not `<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chrome</ENAMEX>,‚Äù
although of course the pun on this word is intentional.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crome</ENAMEX> is the name of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, just as
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wuthering Heights</ENAMEX> is.)  And we can conveniently
add a couple of pause-causing poetic titles here, too:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Moore</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lalla Rookh</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1817</TIMEX>), and not a jot
otherwise, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tennyson</ENAMEX>'s The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady</ENAMEX> of Shalott
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1832</TIMEX>), not ‚ÄúShallot,‚Äù which makes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> smack
strongly of veganism.

            It is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> small step from such pitfalls to
those holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">punctuational</ENAMEX> and related snares, the
latter often involving the problem of whether a title
is one word or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">apostrophe</ENAMEX> has much to
answer for here, as it does in everyday <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  So
let us note: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Joyce</ENAMEX>'s novel is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finnegans Wake</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</TIMEX>), not ‚ÄúFinnegan's,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù E. M. Forster</ENAMEX>'s is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Howards End</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1910</TIMEX>) (another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> name, by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>), not ‚ÄúHoward's,‚Äù and, a potential double delusion,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s famous play is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Love's Labour</ENAMEX>'s
Lost (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1598</TIMEX>), with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> apostrophes.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of these
is the possessive, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> represents the vowel of
is .  (The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce</ENAMEX> title is typical of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s linguistically
inventive but allusive style, and is actually a
compound of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> proper names: that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finn</ENAMEX>
MaCool, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk-hero</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Finnegan</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> of a music-hall ballad, who sprang to life in the
middle of his own wake.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyphens</ENAMEX> can cause difficulties, too.  So Melville
wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moby-Dick</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1851</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Buchan</ENAMEX>'s autobiography
was called Memory Hold-the-Door (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX>),
but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robertson Davies</ENAMEX> wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tempest Tost</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX>),
with no hyphen.  As for the ‚Äúone-or-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-word‚Äù
problem, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Scott</ENAMEX> wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redgauntlet</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1824</TIMEX>) and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Buchan</ENAMEX> (again) named his novel of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> adventure
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huntingtower</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1922</TIMEX>).

            While we're about it, we should not overlook
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coleridge</ENAMEX>'s poem, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Rime</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancient Mariner</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1798</TIMEX>), not ‚ÄúRhyme,‚Äù or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byron</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Childe Harold</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilgrimage</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1811</TIMEX>), not ‚ÄúChild,‚Äù or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruskin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrows</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chace</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1880</TIMEX>), not ‚ÄúChase.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Both Byron</ENAMEX>'s and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruskin</ENAMEX>'s wayward words are directly related to their
modern equivalents but have essentially historic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spellings</ENAMEX>.

            And there we have another whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river</ENAMEX> to cross,
since some of the best-known literary works have
retained their historic titles, complete with outmoded
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spellings</ENAMEX> and punctuations.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spenser</ENAMEX> is notoriously
troublesome here, with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Shepheardes</ENAMEX> Calender
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1579</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Faerie Queene</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1590</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hubberds Tale</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1591</TIMEX>) among the greatest hazards.
In a sense, it seems illogical that we have retained
the historic spellings for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spenser</ENAMEX>'s works yet use
modern spellings for the titles of plays by his contemporary,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Shakespeare</ENAMEX>.  But perhaps it is
just as well that we have <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Midsummer Night</ENAMEX>'s
Dream (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1600</TIMEX>), not <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Midsommer nights dream</ENAMEX> , as it
originally was when first published, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX> the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fifth</NUMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry V</ENAMEX> ) (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1600</TIMEX>), not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX> the fift .  A later
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title</ENAMEX>, but still with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äúolde-worlde‚</NUMEX>Äù spelling, is Izaak
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Compleat Angler</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1653</TIMEX>), which oddly
enough, seems to present little problem.

            What can cause a bout of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>-scratching is deciding
whether the definite or indefinite article is
involved.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> play that quite often
goes wrong is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Winter's Tale</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1611</TIMEX>)--‚ÄúThe,‚Äù not
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúA,‚Äù</ENAMEX>--while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome K. Jerome</ENAMEX>, giving no trouble at
all with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Three Men in a Boat</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1889</TIMEX>), followed it up
by taking the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> on a tour of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germany</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Three Men on the Bummel</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX>).  The last word
of this is the name of a river, so ‚ÄúA‚Äù is quite out of
order.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth McLeish</ENAMEX>, once again hold your
hand out!)

            A sort of juvenile <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-off here, spellingwise, is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daisy Ashford</ENAMEX>'s charming novel, written when she
was only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young Visiters</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1919</TIMEX>).  The authoress
may be excused her youthful slip, but once
she has made it, we are obliged to preserve it!
Among the true deviants, the titles that are neither
immediately nor even sometimes ever really meaningful
(although they may become so during the
reading of the book), are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-minefields</ENAMEX> of such
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Alther</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kinflicks</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mervyn Peake</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gormenghast</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Carey</ENAMEX>'s Illywhacker
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>).

            Of course, similar titular problems occur in areas
outside literature, too.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vaughan Williams</ENAMEX>'s chilly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symphony</ENAMEX> that developed out of his music for the
‚ÄúBritish hero‚Äù movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antarctic</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX>)
was actually entitled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinfonia Antartica</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1953</TIMEX>),
which seems rather perverse.  And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Gay</ENAMEX>'s greatest
but much more light-hearted work was called
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beggar's Opera</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1728</TIMEX>), singular, not plural.
Even more obviously in the world of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">musical</ENAMEX> (and
visual) entertainment, it is worth noting that the Folies
Berg√® are spelled with the first word plural,
but the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> singular.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Everyman</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Encyclopxdia</ENAMEX> ,

            Well, I'm off to bed now, for good re-read of

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Literacy</ENAMEX> and numeracy have come to the fore in
recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> as major issues, not only (or even so
much) in the Third World as in the industrialized
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nations</ENAMEX>.  Leaving numeracy aside for the moment,
those of us who have studied linguistics have usually
been told that as language is essentially spoken, its
written form is of lesser (or no) importance for the
analysis of language.  That is patent rubbish, of
course, for it can easily be demonstrated that written
language cannot be ignored for a variety of reasons:
the more formalized versions of language that are
reflected there, the relatively complex constructions
that are accepted as normal to writing but would be
difficult to construct viva voce and difficult to assimilate
unless read, the preservation of fossilized
forms--both words and grammar--made possible
by written records, and so on.  These and other features
of writing have an undeniable effect on language,
and it would be foolish to ignore them just
because language is, at bottom, an oral means of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>.  That is not to say that writing and
speech should be measured by the same yardsticks,
only that writing cannot be ignored in a proper
treatment of language.

            Writing has not been ignored entirely by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>
on language, but its role has been consistently
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underplayed</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coulmas</ENAMEX>'s clear exposition of the history
of writing systems traces the development of
various kinds of writing systems--ideographic, pictographic,
morphemic, syllabic, phonemic, and phonetic--through
history, discussing them individually,
describing how certain ancient scripts were
deciphered, and presenting his cogent arguments for
regarding at least some aspects of language through
the analysis of writing.  It is only through their written
forms that we know anything at all about certain
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">languages</ENAMEX>, and the written forms of others serve to
confirm the findings of diachronic linguistics in positing
the pronunciation and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of long-dead
tongues.

            It is generally conceded that writing was invented
because of the need to keep records as civilizations
became more complex.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scholars</ENAMEX> generally
agree that the use of a numerical marking system
preceded attempts at developing methods for transcribing
language per se ; I find in accepting that fact
some interesting implications for theories about how
the mind works and, in particular, its capacity for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abstracting</ENAMEX>.  It must be emphasized, of course, that
language preceded numeracy, but it is interesting to
see how very early in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s acculturation the ability
to deal with the abstract notion of counting manifested
itself and was then transferred into an encodable
form.  In its most primitive form, a record might
consist of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> of clay similar in shape to those of the
items being counted (for identification), the quantity
of bits being equal to the number of items counted.
Subsequently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay bits</ENAMEX> were replaced by marks
(even as we make them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">\?\</ENAMEX>) with a picture of
what was being counted (pots or sheaves of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incised</ENAMEX> alongside the count.  Much later, to save
space, the `<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">\?\</ENAMEX>' was to be replaced by a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>,
say, `<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>.'  Meanwhile, the picture of the grain sheaf
was itself to be replaced by a shorthand version, and
that is where things begin to get complicated.  I have
already simplified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coulmas</ENAMEX>'s description out of all
sensible recognition for the sake of brevity, but,
while the time compression has been severe, I do
not think I have distorted the facts.

            For us who can read and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">count</ENAMEX> and take such matters
so much for granted, it seems impossible to believe
that it took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 500 years</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2500-2000</TIMEX> BC)
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sumerians</ENAMEX> to reduce their cuneiform character
inventory from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 500</NUMEX>.  As they were overrun
and absorbed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akkadians</ENAMEX> by 1900 BC, even
that might be viewed as a bootless economy.  While it
must be noted that the cuneiform system, based on a
pattern of wedge-like signs impressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX> by a specially
cut <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">reed stylus</ENAMEX>, served several Mesopotamian
cultures for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 3000 years</TIMEX>, it was used for writing
several languages of diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sumerian</ENAMEX> was
an agglutinative language, in structure of the type of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American Indian</ENAMEX> languages, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX>, etc.; Akkadian
was a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Semitic</ENAMEX> language, similar in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>;
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elamites</ENAMEX> spoke a language of which we
know little, but it is interesting to note that about
1500 BC they changed from the script writing system
they had been using to cuneiform, and in the ‚Äúshort‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than 500 years</TIMEX> had reduced the number of
symbols to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113</NUMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hittites</ENAMEX>, who spoke a language
with some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> characteristics, also wrote
in cuneiform, as did the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old Persian</ENAMEX>, a true
Indo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> language.  Indeed, it was the trilingual
(<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old Persian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elamite</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Neo-Baby</ENAMEX> lonian)
inscription of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darius</ENAMEX> that provided the key for the
decipherment of several ancient writings.  Ugaritic, another
Semitic language, was also written in cuneiform.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuneiform</ENAMEX> writing thus served different functions;
that is, from its original use for pictograms, it
became stylized to the point where the images were
unrecognizable without decoding.  As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>
of various languages applied it to their needs, it became
somewhat more sophisticated; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elamites</ENAMEX>,
for example, were able to economize on the number
of symbols by assigning to most of them syllabic
identity, a major step toward the development of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alphabetic</ENAMEX> writing.  In his description of writing systems
Coulmas adopts the designations applied by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">W.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haas</ENAMEX>, namely, pleremic to describe the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lexemic</ENAMEX>/morphemic
level and cenemic to describe the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">syllabic/</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">phonetic/phonemic</ENAMEX> level.  Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> is
quick to point out that these classifications are not
mutually exclusive, even in the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extant</ENAMEX> writing
that has been interpreted, they provide a convenient
point of departure for descriptions of what is going
on in a writing system.  Thus, we might conclude that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian</ENAMEX> hieroglyphics are largely pleremic, while
our modern alphabetic system is largely cenemic,
though neither is exclusively so.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the more fascinating subjects dealt with
in this book is the decipherment of written languages.
Those who have read the books by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leonard</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cottrell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Ventris</ENAMEX> and know about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champollion</ENAMEX>'s
decipherment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosetta Stone</ENAMEX> will find
this chapter extremely interesting.  It is worth noting
that decipherment of such archaeological materials
differs from modern code decipherment because for
the latter we can assume that a modern language was
encoded, while in the former there are often no
clues to the nature of the language, to what extent it
is pleremic or cenemic, where ‚Äúword breaks‚Äù occur
(if, indeed, the language had words as we know
them in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>), and, in many instances, even the
order in which the symbols were recorded.

            There is much in this book to inspire the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>.
Those who advocate spelling reform are referred to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> on the alphabet, from which the following
is quoted:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etymological Spelling</ENAMEX>

In many orthographies purely phonemic representations
of words are corrupted for the sake of
graphically preserving their etymologies.  For example,
breakfast continues to be spelled with
<ea> although the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> vowel of the word is [\?\],
because it is etymologically related to the verb to
break.  The <w> in acknowledge points to its etymological
relation with to know.  ‚ÄúSilent‚Äù letters
such as <l> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX>, <k> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">knife</ENAMEX>, or <w> in wrestle
are etymological remnants rather than representations
of phonological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.  Silent <e> in
English occurs in many affixes of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> origin such as<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">, for instance, -able</ENAMEX>, -age,
-ance, -ate and -ative, and is therefore statistically
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with words originating from these languages.

Etymological spelling is common in learned
words, especially words of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> origin.  Sign- in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> and paradigm- in paradigmatic are spelled
phonemically, but as isolated words they contain
a letter, <g>, which has no counterpart in the
phonemic representation.  Medicine-medical and
righteous-right are similar pairs where the rationale
for the spelling of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> lies in the relation
with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>.  In this way, the spelling of a
word often relates to that of other words belonging
to the same paradigm, or to its own history.
The h-muet in many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> words such as
honeur, humeur, h√¥pital, humide, hiver, etc., is
etymological, testifying to their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> origin.  In
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, too, the spelling of the corresponding
words can be regarded as etymological with the
added peculiarity that they also exemplify the
mechanism of spelling pronunciation, because
they were borrowed for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
rather than from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> at a time when the
<h> was no longer pronounced in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.

[pp. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">170-71</ENAMEX>]

            

            There are other arguments for preserving spelling
mentioned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coulmas</ENAMEX>, among them: paradigmatic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">similarity</ENAMEX> (e.g., for preserving the relationship
between anxious and, anxiety and, in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, between
Tag [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tak</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tage</ENAMEX> [tag\?\]); word representation
(e.g., liaison in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>); homograph avoidance
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bear</ENAMEX>/bare, hair/hare ) and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">German</ENAMEX>
(e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wagen</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>'/ wagen `dare,' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arm</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>'/ arm
`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX>'); loanword identification (e.g., writing of
words of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> origin with <ch>, as in chronology,
psychology , rather than <k> and with <ph>, as in
philosophy, sophisticate , rather than <f>.  If spelling
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformers</ENAMEX> had their way, and spelling matched pronunciation,
then the spelling would have to be different
for each dialect of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  Such a situation
did prevail in the earliest beginnings of the writing
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, in which can be seen the truest forerunner
of the modern alphabet: as an artifact it is valuable
to us as a key to studying ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> dialects;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> it would contribute nothing
more than utter confusion.  Moreover, if such an
approach were adopted, could we expect to see
spellings change, periodically, as pronunciations
changed?

            Today, albeit with certain adjustments, we can
read the writings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> and, with somewhat
more sophisticated adaptation, those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaucer</ENAMEX>,
though they are, respectively, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400 and 550</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX>.  (We cannot always be sure we understand
what we are reading, but that is another matter.)  If
we were to adopt a phonetic system of spelling, it is
unlikely that our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">great-grandchildren</ENAMEX> would be able
to read anything written in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>.  It
might be argued that the writing should be phonemic,
not phonetic, but phonemes change, too,
though more slowly.  As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coulmas</ENAMEX> points out, the alphabet
is far from perfect; but were we to institute a
‚Äúsimplified‚Äù spelling system we would be destroying
the very unity that the written language accords
to the many <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> around the globe who can read
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.

            Purists always seem bent on the preservation of
an older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> of the language.  Were that undertaken,
we should soon find that the traditional form
would become frozen in writing (and on the tongues
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purists</ENAMEX> and pedants), while the continuously
changing language of the marketplace moved onward.
The term applied to this rather unhealthy situation
is diglossia , which does exist in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sinhalese</ENAMEX>, spoken
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sri Lanka</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coulmas</ENAMEX>:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Literary Sinhalese</ENAMEX> obtained its standard in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fourteenth century AD</ENAMEX>, and this standard is respected
by the whole speech community.  `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The</ENAMEX>
belief that [the] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Literary</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX>] is superior,
more beautiful, more logical and more correct
prevails at every level of the society.'...  This attitude
is typical of diglossia.  It implies that in a
speech <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> where illiteracy is widespread
a large part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> has very little esteem
for the only variety they speak....  [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p. 195</ENAMEX>]
[The quotation is from one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coulmas</ENAMEX>'s many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.]
            

            There is, of course, no final word on this subject,
but I should like to add <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more brief quotation
that strikes at the heart of the matter:


[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">riting</ENAMEX> is not, and never was, a means of
transcribing speech sounds, but is rather an instrument
of visually representing language by
means of relating visual signs in various different
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> which are more or less faithful to the
speech sounds of a given language at a given
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.
            

            This review is not the place to take up the cudgel
against purism or spelling reform, but I could not
resist adducing such apt comments as can be found
in this work.

            I have seldom seen so clear an exposition of any
complex subject as that presented by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coulmas</ENAMEX>.  The
text is punctuated here and there by tables showing
the progressive development of selected symbols
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as</NUMEX>, for example, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sumerian</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Devanagari</ENAMEX> syllabary
(in which several modern and ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX>
languages are written), the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>, and
other alphabets, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> writing, and
attractive drawings showing the hieroglyphic (with
sound values in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> orthography).  This is not to
say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> will be come away from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Writing</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systems</ENAMEX> of the World with the ability to read the

the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Talmud , or the Book of the Dead</ENAMEX> , but they will
certainly have a much better understanding of what
it is they do not know, and pursuit of the available
material cited in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</NUMEX>-page <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bibliography</ENAMEX> could
prove very worthwhile.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tolstoy</ENAMEX> had something when he said that all
happy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are alike, while every unhappy
family is unhappy in its own way.  It seems to me that
every happy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, like every pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>, has a
language all its own.

            Little do some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">acquaintances</ENAMEX> who have
had walk-on parts in the little dramas of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>'s
life and mine know that their names are a permanent
part of our language.  I was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gullible child</ENAMEX>, and so I
was often befriended by major league <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liars</ENAMEX>.  Try as
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> might to reason with me, I steadfastly
believed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty Kurlinski</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four million dollars</NUMEX>
to spend on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> presents.  She also told me
that each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> drank directly from
his or her own half-gallon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> carton at meals, each
personalized with a name in crayon.  Thus, we call a
whopper a kurlinski , which can also be used as a
verb, as in, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúHe</ENAMEX> told me he had to work late--
again--but I think he kurlinskied.‚Äù

            I come by my gullibility naturally.  My maternal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grandmother</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dovey</ENAMEX> and

a chant I now use with my own credulous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúTis</ENAMEX> so if 'tain't so, if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dovey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lena</ENAMEX> say so.‚Äù

            From the neighborhood we grew up in comes
the term a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy Groves</ENAMEX> , used to describe a glutton,
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">remembrance</TIMEX> of a fat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> who could be heard
squealing for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> hamburger or another scoop

were open.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro Purvis</ENAMEX> is a libidinous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergyman</ENAMEX>, named
after an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evangelist</ENAMEX> who once whipped both of our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX> into a frenzy of desire when we were visiting
a fundamentalist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Brother</ENAMEX>
Purvis strained the buttons on his vest as his face
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purpled</ENAMEX> and he growled (as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samson</ENAMEX> vainly resisting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delilah</ENAMEX>), ‚ÄúShe tempts me, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lord</ENAMEX>!  Oh, how she tempts

            We call a rah-rah sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, stirred by maniacal
devotion to a trivial cause, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawkeye Toilet</ENAMEX>
Seat , a term that requires considerable explanation.
My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> once dated a strapping young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who
was a diehard booster of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Iowa</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sports</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> of which are called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawkeyes</ENAMEX>.  He
picked her up clad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> to toe in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> colors of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">black</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, looking like a giant bumblebee.  Such
a rabid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> was he that his car horn played the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hawkeye Fight Song</ENAMEX>.  When my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>
heard this tale, he speculated that the old beau's toilet
seat played the same tune when he lifted it.  You
see, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother-in-law</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill ‚Äúgets it,‚</ENAMEX>Äù my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>'s
words for the litmus test one uses for prospective
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who gets it has humor, purpose, a
sense of the absurd, and a strong world view.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of
the gems <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> has added to our language is the
phrase, ‚ÄúI wonder what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharps</ENAMEX> and the Ushkrats
are doing tonight.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  One</ENAMEX> rares back and uses this
phrase when one finds himself in surroundings of unaccustomed
elegance, such as sipping an aperitif in
an elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> with a bevy of tuxedoed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waiters</ENAMEX>
dancing attendance.  When my brother-in-law
was a newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> in a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, there were
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, feuding but frequently intermarrying,
who often turned up in the police news.
They were the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharps</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ushkrats</ENAMEX>, and once, a
Sharp hanged himself in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">county</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>--a
young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> torn between taste and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sensation</ENAMEX>--decided
to run a photo of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, complete with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharp</ENAMEX>'s dangling noose and a kicked-over chair.  He
thought the better of his decision when the papers
hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, and a contingent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharps</ENAMEX> marched
into the newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>.  Turned out they weren't
angry but proud, and had come in to buy out the rest
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>'s papers.

            My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>'s marriage to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill has ‚Äútaken</ENAMEX>,‚Äù as she
puts it; her first never did.  I sensed that when I stood
beside her in the receiving line at her first wedding,
and she muttered under her breath, ‚ÄúThis is a bluebird
fly-up.‚Äù  When my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> was a bluebird , about
to fly up to become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Campfire Girl</ENAMEX>, she was beside
herself with anticipation.  Of course, the ceremony
was not the transfiguring experience she had hoped.
Thus arose the term bluebird fly-up for a disappointing
experience.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vikki Carr</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">song, ‚ÄúIs That All</ENAMEX>
There <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Is?</ENAMEX>,‚Äù  pretty much dismisses all of life as a
bluebird fly-up .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sissy</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> never got it, but he did
leave her with a useful term, the big bubble , which
he used--rather bitterly--to describe our sheltered
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upbringing</ENAMEX>.  Now, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holiday</TIMEX> family gatherings, my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> greet us gaily at the door with shouts of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúWelcome</ENAMEX> back to the big bubble!‚Äù

            Clotheshorses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>, and I
often use these occasions as an opportunity for a
shopping spree.  We refer to a garment that is both
distinctive and frequently worn as a uni , short for
both unique and uniform .  Rare is the uni that can be
bought off the rack; most are created from a mix of
patterns by my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s clever needle.  ‚ÄúI have vision,‚Äù
she admits modestly as she selects sleeves
from one pattern envelope and cuffs from another.
Sometimes she'll whip up a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bront√</ENAMEX>´ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> , which is an
essentially somber dress with some feminine furbelow--a
row of tiny covered buttons, perhaps--to
hint that the wearer has hidden fires <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">banked</ENAMEX> beneath
her peplum.  A slinky garment, on the other hand--
the kind one might wear to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX>
party--is called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satan</ENAMEX> bow-dice .  This colorful
phrase we picked up at a fashion show narrated by a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentleman</ENAMEX> who was obviously unfamiliar with the
pronunciation of satin bodice .

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quasi Modo</ENAMEX> is a dress with the big shoulder
pads that are currently ultra chic, but have an unfortunate
tendency to slip, giving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> a hunchbacked
appearance.  When we try a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quasi Modo</ENAMEX> on, we can't
resist drooling a little in the dressing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, and calling
out ‚ÄúSanctuary!‚Äù

            Since my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> and I share a poor sense of direction
as well as an intense interest in fashion, we have
a tendency to get lost on the way <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> from our
treasure hunts.  We grew up west-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siders</ENAMEX> who might
as well have been in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> when we crossed over to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east</ENAMEX> side of our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.

            ‚ÄúWhat am I doing wrong?‚Äù  I asked once when
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sissy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX> were chattering obliviously in the
back seat on the way <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> from a shopping expedition.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Sissy</ENAMEX> answered with a certain irrefutable
logic, ‚Äúyou're coming the going way.‚Äù

            I knew she meant I was headed away from our
side of town.  We still refer to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who is lost,
either literally or spiritually, as coming the going
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> .  As one might suspect, this tendency to lose
one's bearings at the wheel can have unhappy results.
Much to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>'s consternation, the word collision
isn't part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sissy</ENAMEX>'s vocabulary.  Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> didn't
really hit that nasty old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cadillac</ENAMEX>, it just ‚Äúnudged‚Äù it
a little.  Thus, dents are called nudgies , and major
dents--the ones that require <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $500</NUMEX> to repair--
are owies .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> would feel as if he were coming the going
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> on our shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">expeditions</ENAMEX>, but he manages to
put a flair all his own in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> lingo.  He loves
having his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> fetch for him.  ‚ÄúWould ye bring
me a cup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cubes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>?‚Äù  he'll
ask.  Or, ‚ÄúWould ye bring me a toothpick?‚Äù  Since all
his requests begin that way, we've come to call people
who work in the service sector--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waiters</ENAMEX>, hotel
bellmen, maids-- wouldyes .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dad</ENAMEX>'s also responsible for making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Custer</ENAMEX>
a synonym for a transvestite.  Once on a family
vacation, he insisted on driving through a thunderstorm
for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 miles</NUMEX> to reach a wax <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Deadwood</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX>.  Apparently there was a shortage
of male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dummies</ENAMEX>, because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Custer</ENAMEX> had
red lips, boobs, and a luxurious, long blonde wig.

            Much to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX>'s dismay, we got the giggles as a guide
provided highlights of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Custer's Last Stand</ENAMEX>.

            When we started dating, a whole new jargon
arose.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dad</ENAMEX>, who often dismissed our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriends</ENAMEX> as
immature, called a good many of them pot-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX>,
because in his estimation, they still had pot rings on
their behinds.  When a pot-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringer</ENAMEX> got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of us upset
enough to weep and gnash our teeth, the storm that
betook us was called a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>-banger, from the unforgettable
episode when I was stood up on prom
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and banged my carefully coiffed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> against
the wall.

            Now my own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are providing me with
new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linguistic seeds</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>.  My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> make up
for all the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of avoiding dental bills by putting
dishes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candy</ENAMEX> on every available surface in their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> when I bring my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> back to the big bubble.
Round, hard <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candies</ENAMEX> that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> could choke on
are called choke <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>, because when they were
toddlers, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> admonished my <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
that those could choke the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>.  My <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six-year-old</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas</ENAMEX>, recently gave a choke <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> to baby
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>, watched him for a moment, and reported in
some disgruntlement that choke <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> don't work.

            Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas</ENAMEX> collects everything from spent
batteries to flattened <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX>, his nickname is junk
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Man</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> is called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wee Geordie</ENAMEX> after
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Welsh</ENAMEX> novel my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> read.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate</ENAMEX>,
because of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">la-di-da</ENAMEX> air, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss Fine Thing</ENAMEX> .  Once
we took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss Fine Thing</ENAMEX> on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> outing to the
historic little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mantorville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX>.  We
didn't know until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> that during the entire drive
up, she trembled in fear of the unfamiliar destination.
So now, an experience one regards with foreboding
is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mantorville</ENAMEX> .  Not certain which direction
I'll be heading, I think of the afterlife as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mantorville</ENAMEX> .

            We always call <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cedar Rapids</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>, See the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rabbits</ENAMEX>,
because once, on my return from a business trip
there, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Junk Man</ENAMEX> asked with great excitement, ‚ÄúDid
you see the rabbits?‚Äù

            As we leave our little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> to visit the city my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> live in, we pass a big green <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>.  Since the
drive gives just enough time for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to get a
good nap and for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX>, and me to talk or
just think our own thoughts for a change, we always
have the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> play silence when we get to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>.
Thus it is known not as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wellman Dynamics</ENAMEX>, but
as the shut-up place .

            And what a fertile field for new jargon potty
training has been!  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX>'s term for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in the awkward
stage between needing diapers and being reliable
in big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> or big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> (real underpants) is a time
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bomb</ENAMEX> .  When accidents happen, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> never admits
being soaking wet, but will concede to feeling
the ‚Äúleast little bit dampish.‚Äù  Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couch</ENAMEX>, fortunately
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upholstered</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, has been the scene of
many such accidents and is thus called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Forever Amber</ENAMEX> .
A deep reclining chair we bought at an estate
sale his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> held after an elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gent</ENAMEX>'s death is
called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dead Man's Gulch</ENAMEX> .  The dead part has a double
meaning as the chair has unpredictable springs,
and the mere shift of a haunch can project like a
missile the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> we have forgotten to warn.

            In our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, scatalogical humor seems to
bridge the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>.  Perhaps the best time had
by all was on an outing to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota Zoo</ENAMEX>, where
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gorilla</ENAMEX> was eating vast handfuls of his own bright
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yellow feces</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúLook</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>!‚Äù  called an excited
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúThat gorilla</ENAMEX>'s eating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mustard!‚</ENAMEX>Äù  When the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> refer to the results of a new recipe I've tried as
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gorilla mustard</ENAMEX>, I know it's best to retire it.  One
mealtime chant the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are seldom allowed to
make is ‚ÄúEat every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bean</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pea</ENAMEX> on your plate.‚Äù
This comes from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> whose innocent grandma
made that declaration every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, not knowing
what occasioned the sniggering from her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX>.

            Discipline gives rise to even more lexicon.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebel</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixties</TIMEX>, calls <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> who go limp in public
by way of passive resistance war <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protestors</ENAMEX> .  He also
warns darkly that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> who does what another
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> has already been reprimanded for is in double
trouble .

            Though our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> language is like a little tribal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dialect</ENAMEX>--useless outside of its narrow confines--its
value is inestimable to us.  Every happy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>'s language
is different, but they all translate into love.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Concise Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
            This is an abridgment of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX> edition of A
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English</ENAMEX>, by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Partridge</ENAMEX>, edited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Beale</ENAMEX> and published
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>.  Born in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1884</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Partridge</ENAMEX> died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paul</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beale</ENAMEX> has picked up the reins in an able manner and
continues to charge ahead.  This edition, though
abridged, is said to contain much material not included
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1984</TIMEX> edition, published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macmillan</ENAMEX>.  Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúit</ENAMEX> contains only terms
known to have arisen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twentieth Century</ENAMEX>,‚Äù
according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preface</ENAMEX>, but omits the military
slang of the earlier <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th century</TIMEX>.  I am inclined to
question the accuracy about the terms known to
have arisen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>, for I found quite a
few of much earlier date, but that can scarcely be an
adverse criticism.

            As in the case of most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Partridge</ENAMEX>'s books, the
exception being Catch <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Phrases</ENAMEX>, which I didn't think
much of, this dictionary [ CDS ] makes good browsing
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fodder</ENAMEX> and resembles the earlier books in style sufficiently
to satisfy those familiar with the format.  Personally,
I find it irritating to find entries with several
definitions in which numbers are given to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and onward
but not to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I</ENAMEX>, a practice I simply cannot understand.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> ought not be put off by the number
of pages, for this is a large-format book with a fair
amount of text.

            The CDS, however, will not fill the needs of
those looking for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slang</ENAMEX>, unless they are interested
in those <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> slang terms that were borrowed
from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> (and elsewhere).  With experience,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> becomes accustomed to the arrogance of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> who consider the term <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> to be proprietary,
with the understood meaning `<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British English</ENAMEX>,'
presumably implying that all other Englishes
should carry a label, the only place where ( real )
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is spoken being <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>.  As it happens, of
course, there are more distinctive dialects of English
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, and anyone who
has spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">any time</TIMEX> listening to them knows that
some are mutually unintelligible.  Linguistic chauvinism
might be understandable were we discussing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> (that is, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Received Pronunciation</ENAMEX> of the prestige
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southern British dialect</ENAMEX>), but, if that is the case,
in the present instance we must then be looking at a
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary of ‚ÄúRP Slang</ENAMEX>,‚Äù whatever that might be.
The value of the book is not diminished by its being
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> slang, but, considering the percentage
of the content that is attributable to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> slang (mostly), that part of native
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> slang that does not emerge as derivative
has an old-fashioned ring to it.  It is, at worst, cruelly
deceptive not to make it clear from the title (or a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subtitle</ENAMEX>) that the book's focus is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> slang.

            That having been said, let us turn to the content,
at which point prudish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> might wish to
turn to another page.

            Without laboring the point (nudge! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nudge</ENAMEX>!), the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> entry one turns to is fuck, which, in keeping
with the length and depth of the CDS , is what one
might call a quickie entry (nudge! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nudge</ENAMEX>!, though
that sense appears under the entry quick <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ).  I cannot
claim proficiency in slang, but I do know that in
addition to the `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Scram</ENAMEX>!' sense of fuck off , a common
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>) sense is `gold-brick,' which is missing (though
covered here under fucking the dog ).  Is it missing
because it is not used in that sense in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> or because
it was cut, and, if the latter, because it went
the way of earlier <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th-century</TIMEX> military slang?  Unfortunately,
there is no way one can determine the
answer without having the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX> edition to hand.  If
one had the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX> edition, he might well resent having
to buy this book rather than a briefer (and less
expensive) Supplement.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> gets the strong impression that for those
entries that are acknowledged as being of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX>,
or other origin the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> has very few, if any,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">citations</ENAMEX>, for most of the words and expressions are
not traced back very far.  For example, puddle-jumper
is defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAF</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1942</TIMEX>) slang for a small
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>; that might be coincidence,
but it surely is of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> origin, traceable back to
the gear in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Don</ENAMEX> was wont to arrive for
his radio program on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rainy days in the early 1930s</TIMEX>.
On the cuff and off the cuff are in, with no American
provenance mentioned and dated far too late (‚Äúsince
1920s‚Äù): the term arose well before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX>, from
the time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> wore (detachable) Celluloid
shirtcuffs on which memos were conveniently penciled
because they could be wiped off with a damp
cloth.  Without this explanation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beale</ENAMEX>'s cryptic ‚ÄúEx
note scribbled on stiff shirtcuff‚Äù would give a laundryman
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nightmares</ENAMEX>.

            Expressions like blow it out your ear (inaccurately
described as ‚Äúwidespread in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West N. Am</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>)
ought to be marked as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúminced oaths‚Äù</ENAMEX> (for ear read
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ass</ENAMEX> ).  Disregard or ignorance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slang</ENAMEX> has led to
the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honkie as ‚Äúsince</ENAMEX> (?) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1960s</TIMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which tells little.  Although the modern slang
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hickey</ENAMEX> means a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">` ‚Äúsuction‚Äù kiss</ENAMEX> that leaves a mark,'
and not, thank God, as CDS has it, ‚Äúraises a blister,‚Äù
its original meaning was `skin blemish,' and cosmetic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> regularly used the
word in their advertising (often with the implied
sense `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pimple</ENAMEX>').  And the expression gone with the
wind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antedated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Mitchell</ENAMEX>'s book--indeed,
she so named the book because of the clich√©, not the
other way round; a cursory check of my Bloomsbury

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lyric poet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Dowson</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1867-1900</TIMEX>).

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gofer</ENAMEX> is said to have been current in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>

held accountable for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barnhart</ENAMEX>'s scholarship, but I
can say that I personally know the term to have been
used in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1950s</TIMEX>, and I did not then get the
impression that it had been coined for my benefit.

            I was pleased to see that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beale</ENAMEX> accepts the etymology
of (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>) po-faced as coming from po
`chamber pot,' disagreeing with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Collins English Dictionary</ENAMEX>
[Editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. Urdang</ENAMEX>] which traces
it to a modification of poor-faced .  I never cared for
that, on the grounds that I know of no <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> dialect
that pronounces poor as [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pou</ENAMEX>].

            I had never noticed it before, but the reason
that the old-fashioned bicycle was named the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">penny</NUMEX>-farthing
was that the large front wheel bore the
same proportion to the tiny <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at the rear as a (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>)
penny bore to a farthing.  Apparently, everyone
knew that but me.

            Rhyming slang, of course, provides some of the
best fun: it is a mystery to me how anyone who is
unfamiliar with the origin of a given bit of rhyming
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slang</ENAMEX> can ever divine what it means.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bexley Heath</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hounslow Heath</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hampstead Heath</ENAMEX> are all rhyming
slang for `teeth,' with the last often shortened to
just <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hampsteads</ENAMEX> .  I suppose it has to be in your
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorites</ENAMEX> (till I find another) is

strengthened by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> verb in the predominant
construction and usage, `Get down on your

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">‚ÄúRN‚Äù stands</ENAMEX> for `<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Navy</ENAMEX>,' <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the ‚Äús</ENAMEX>.‚Äù for
`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slang</ENAMEX>' (but perhaps everyone knew that already).
After such an exposition it is small wonder to me
when I occasionally see, beneath The [<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>] Times
crossword puzzle, ‚ÄúThis puzzle was completed by
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 per cent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contestants</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> minutes‚Äù in a

dismaying when one is able to fill in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> or two
words after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX>.

            I suggest only that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beale</ENAMEX> stop at the point where
he has identified the origin of a given expression as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> and eschew the information found in some
of the secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> he resorted to, for they are
inconsistent in their accuracy.  Despite my criticism
of the inaccuracies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> slang source material, if
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> focuses on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> and takes the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> with a pinch of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>, this book is very engaging
and can provide anyone with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">many hours</TIMEX> of
happy, entertaining, and informative browsing.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cassell Concise English Dictionary</ENAMEX>
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September, 1989</TIMEX>, preceding what has come
to be known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Waterloo Conference</ENAMEX> on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> (because its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four annual</TIMEX> meetings were
held at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waterloo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>), members
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Association for Lexicography</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EURALEX</ENAMEX>) held a symposium on dictionary reviewing.
By the time I decided to attend, the meeting
was overbooked, and I could not get in.  Besides <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX>
McArthur, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English Today</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Ilson</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Oxford Journal of Lexicography</ENAMEX>, I am
not sure who of those attending were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> of
dictionaries, but I think that I can probably say,
without fear of contradiction, that I have probably
written and continue to write more reviews of English
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionaries</ENAMEX> (and of other reference books and
books on language) than most other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Quantity,</ENAMEX>
of course, does not make up for quality; yet,
something might be said for experience.  I am sure
that I would have learnt something and regret having
been turned away.

            As I did not attend, I cannot say exactly what
went on at the symposium, but I got the impression
that one of its results was to be the issuance of
guidelines for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ha</ENAMEX>! --Well, maybe not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúHa!‚Äù</ENAMEX> I think that what the symposiasts might have
discussed were criteria for assessing a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>,
which they would like to see adopted by the media
and given to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> assigned or invited to write
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> such books.  There is no doubt that the quality
of such reviews varies enormously.  When assigning a
book for review in other subjects, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> are usually
rather careful to try to find someone who knows
something about the subject of the book: it would be
unusual to find a book on, say, archaeology reviewed
by a rock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musician</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on rock music reviewed
by an archaeologist.  But when it comes to dictionaries,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> appear to consider them fair game for
almost anyone, and they often assign novelists to
write the review.

            There are novelists and there are novelists.  I, for
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, would not object to a dictionary review being
written by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Burgess</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Vonnegut</ENAMEX>.
On the other hand, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> is, presumably, `anyone
who has had a novel published'; as we know,
some of the most prolific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelists</ENAMEX> write as if they
know little about the language, and it would be ridiculously
unfair to have such a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> review a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictionaries</ENAMEX> ought to be reviewed by professional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lexicographers</ENAMEX>.  Today, many professional
lexicographers are seen to have axes to grind (because
they work for competing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>
are reluctant to select them as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> because,
for obvious reasons, they are seeking to
publish unbiased reviews.  Some of the dictionary reviews
that have been published in the popular press
have been bad--not unfavourable, just reflective of a
lack of sufficient linguistic sophistication.  It may be
assumed that the reason for giving such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> dictionaries
to review is that they are regarded as end
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>.  But the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> do not select ordinary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> to review novels, they pick other novelists
or professional literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>, in other words, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>
who are competent to assess the work because
they have a broad background in the literature
and are recognized as knowledgeable about the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">genre</ENAMEX>.

            On the same grounds, it is incumbent on editors
to engage as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> of dictionaries lexicographers
who are knowledgeable about the genre, not amateurs
who occasionally look up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> word to see how
it is spelt or another to find out what it means.  Because
anyone writing a review of any book ought to
be required to delineate the reasons for his approval
or disapproval of its style and content, so any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>
worth his <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> should be able to detect in a properly
written, professional review of a dictionary by a lexicographer
any untoward bias and to reject such a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX> (or parts of it) out of hand.

            There are many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> fields represented in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionary</ENAMEX>--phonetics, semantics, morphology,
phonemics, diachronic and comparative linguistics,
symbology, typography, etc.--and the average dictionary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>, whether he be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> or not is ill
equipped academically to pass judgment on how a
given dictionary has dealt with such areas.  As I was
not at the symposium, I can only assume that the
symposiasts concerned themselves less (if at all) with
the problem of trying to urge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> to engage professional
lexicographers as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> than with the
effort of trying to ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> be provided
with certain guidelines on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">How To Review A Dictionary</ENAMEX>,
which they fondly expect would be passed
on to the selected amateur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> thereby making
them competent, professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>, a forlorn
hope at best.

            The foregoing is not entirely irrelevant to my
comments on the book at hand, for it would be unfair
to review it as a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>, comparing it with
other dictionaries.  Rather, it constitutes what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>
call a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúpackage</ENAMEX>,‚Äù that is, it contains a fair
amount of lexicographic material but little or nothing
that is original.  Such books are derivatives of
larger dictionaries in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>'s line, pared down
to make them smaller and not directly competitive
and priced lower.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> publishes a slightly smaller
version which they call their <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pocket English Dictionary</ENAMEX>,
though one is likely to find himself in deep disagreement
with his tailor if he wanted a pocket large
enough to hold the book.  Most major dictionary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publishers</ENAMEX> put out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concise</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Compact</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pocket, Vest</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pocket</ENAMEX>, and other editions, grabbing for markets
that are price-more than content-oriented.  Generally
speaking, the smallest general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionary</ENAMEX> in
which one can expect to find fairly thorough treatment
of etymology, pronunciation, definitions, and a
good coverage of the language in a wide assortment
of entires is the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">College or Desk dictionary</ENAMEX>.
A bigger book usually needs a stand or its own
spot on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">desk</ENAMEX> or table, for it is too big and heavy to
drag out of a bookcase every time it is needed.  The
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> larger <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-volume <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">works</ENAMEX> available are The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Unabridged</ENAMEX> (with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">315,000</NUMEX> entries) and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Merriam-Webstar Unabridged</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third Edition</ENAMEX>
(with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 460,000</NUMEX> entries).  I cannot properly
count the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Edition</ENAMEX>,
because of its cost (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $2500</NUMEX>) and its size (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
volumes); besides, it is not a work for everyday use
but for scholarly application, being historical in
nature.

            In the context of the large number of dictionaries
available (including all their different editions),
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCE</ENAMEX> is a serviceable work provided that one is
satisfied with brief definitions of no great depth,
and, essentially, a dictionary than can be used as a
spelling checker.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX>, spelling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">checkers</ENAMEX> are
available to those who use personal computers,
hence a dictionary for that purpose is of limited usefulness.
One useful function of dictionaries till recently
was that they showed syllabic breaks, enabling
letter- and novel-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> alike to discover
where to hyphenate words.  Some word processing
programs now offer such a feature--the one I use
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Framework III</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ashton-Tate</ENAMEX>), is not bad at all--and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> as well as compositors and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> seem
to care less and less whether a word is hypenated in
an acceptable manner.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCE</ENAMEX> does have price to
recommend it, coming in at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of what a college-or
desk-sized dictionary would cost.

            Inevitably, there are the inconveniences and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oddities</ENAMEX>: the pronunciation of masochistic or masochistically ,
thus depriving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> of the information
that the stresses have shifted.  To those who
maintain, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúEverybody</ENAMEX> knows that,‚Äù I reply that if
that is the case, then why bother buying or publishing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionaries</ENAMEX>--or, for that matter, anything
else--at all?

            Among the (odder) oddities: under make appears
the expression to make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, defined as `to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urinate</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naut</ENAMEX>.) to leak.‚Äù  These are both quite correct,
of course, but their juxtaposition could create a
curious confusion.

            The general production of the book is poor: the
paper has too much ‚Äúsee-through,‚Äù causing the type
on the back of a page to interfere with the legibility;
the type is too gray; the definitions are run into one
another, with semicolons in place of definition numbers,
making it difficult to distinguish senses and requiring
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to read through a long entry before
coming to the sense sought; it is almost impossible to
discover where a new part of speech begins; subentries
of idiomatic phrases and phrasal verbs are given
the same prominence as headwords, making them
easy to find but detracting from the headword treatment;
and the substandard typography has created
many loose lines which poor proofreading has failed
to catch.

            As the explanatory notes are rather thin on the
ground, I am unsure what to make of the insertion of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äú n.pl</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù into the middle of a definition:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">golden</ENAMEX>...golden balls, n. the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> balls, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n.pl</ENAMEX>.
displayed as the emblem of a pawn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX>.
            

            The entry golden handcuff,

               
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">n.</ENAMEX> ...a payment or benefit given to an employee
as an inducement to continue working for
the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.
            

            raises the ludicrous (?) image of such a payment
or benefit being paid by someone other than the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employer</ENAMEX>.

            The entry for golden-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">syrup</ENAMEX> give a cross-reference
to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">syrup</ENAMEX>, where it is not mentioned; as I understand
the style, this means that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are to be
construed as synonyms, which is not the case.  Indeed,
I believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Syrup</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> : no hyphen] is
a trademark owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tate & Lyle</ENAMEX> for a uniquely
treacly mixture.

            The pages containing the un - words are a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">compositor</ENAMEX>'s
nightmare version of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX>'s aberration.

            The etymologies are too brief to be of any use.

            One wonders what goes on in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>' minds:
it seems quite obvious to me that if this were a good
and serviceable inexpensive version of the dictionary
on which it is said to be based, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cassell</ENAMEX>'s English
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> , then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> might well expect
that after a time the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> would feel himself ready
for the larger book and would buy the larger
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cassell</ENAMEX>'s .  In the event, it seems unlikely that such an
event would take place, for this book is a sad disappointment.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> have long complained about the pollution
of their language by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>.  The following
story shows how bad this pollution is:

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX> of our nouvelle is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie</ENAMEX>, a petite
femme fatale from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>.  Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> was a parvenu
who used to be a bon vivant and the enfant terrible
of his clique but became a laissez-faire entrepreneur
in the entrep√¥t business and then accepted a post as
a charg√© d'affaires, which entitled him to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laissez-passer</ENAMEX>,
(working to improve detente, and rapprochement
with the ancien r√©gime), though he remained
a bit of a rou√©, having an affaire with the au
pair.  Her mother, n√©e <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Capet</ENAMEX>, was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">grande dame</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> of savoir faire and joie de vivre, who later became
a clairvoyant and spent her time in s√©ances and
collecting na√Øf gouaches and objets <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">d'art</ENAMEX>.  For a
while, they lived in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">m√©nage √° trois</ENAMEX> with the valet
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de</ENAMEX> chambre, but the valet was arrested as an agent
provocateur, following a coup <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">d'√©tat manqu√</ENAMEX>©, which
turned out to be a d√©bacle.  This became a cause c√©-l√©bre
among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">√©migr√© √©lite</ENAMEX>.  His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> was later
found in a cul-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-sac and dumped in the morgue.  An
expos√© in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> revealed that he was the beau
of a svelte coquette he had met apr√©s-ski and she
gave him the coup de gr√¢ce by poisoning his cr√©me
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caramel</ENAMEX> in a crime passionnel.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie</ENAMEX> recently made
her d√©but as an ing√©nue in a risqu√©, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde cin√</ENAMEX>©ma-v√©rit√©
movie which used advanced montage
techniques, was hailed as a tour de force and became
a succ√©s de scandale.  Because of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' character
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">traits</ENAMEX>, she was brought up in a recherch√© milieu
and spent most of her childhood in a cr√®che, playing
with papier-m√¢ch√© toys.

            Her fianc√© is going to take her to a discoth√©que
and then onto a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cafe</ENAMEX>, though she would rather go to
a th√© dansant.  She waits for him in her boudoir, en
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deshabill√©</ENAMEX>, wearing a neglig√©e, through which her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">toile d'or</ENAMEX> lingerie, particularly her brassi√©re, can be
seen.  She is listening to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chopin</ENAMEX> nocturne, while
lying on a beige <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chaise</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lounge</ENAMEX>, sipping cointreau,
eating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">canap√©s</ENAMEX> and reading a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">roman √† th√®se</ENAMEX>, currently
in vogue.  Her fianc√©, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fran√ßois</ENAMEX>, a petit bourgeois
in behavior, though considering himself the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cr√®me de la cr√©me</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-camp to a general and
has the rank of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenant</ENAMEX>, fancies himself as a raconteur
and litt√©rateur (having published a pastiche of
vers libres and a catalogue raisonn√© of the works of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North</ENAMEX>, which was hailed as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chef</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">d'oeuvre</ENAMEX>),
though his ambition is to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Grand Prix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>.  He
is brought by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chauffeur</ENAMEX>, who acts as chaperon
but they decide that he will be de trop and he takes
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> leave.  Fran√ßois lets himself into the bijou
little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pied-√°</ENAMEX>-terre with a passe-partout.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúCh√©ri</ENAMEX>, can't we go to the premiere of that finde-si√®cle
tableau vivant about clandestine intrigue
in a commune?‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie</ENAMEX> asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fran√ßois</ENAMEX>, eyeing him
through her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pince-nez</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúI</ENAMEX> would rather go to the ballet and see that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX> do pas-<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">de-deux</ENAMEX> and entrechats.  Then down
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chez Georges</ENAMEX>.  He serves delicious
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">champagne</ENAMEX> and vol-au-vents and has a fine art nouveau
collection.‚Äù

            ‚ÄúBut art nouveau is so pass√©.  It is art d√©co that is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">√† la</ENAMEX> mode.‚Äù

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúThat</ENAMEX>'s only for the nouveaux riches.‚Äù

            ‚ÄúYou have an id√©e fixe about art d√©co.  Though,
entre nous, I must agree it is mainly bric-√°-brac.‚Äù

            ‚ÄúEn passant, how about a little divertissement?‚Äù

            ‚ÄúNone of your double entendres, please.  It
shows lack of etiquette.  Perhaps we could go to a bal
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">masqu√©?‚Äù</ENAMEX>

            They finally decide to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal √° deux</ENAMEX> at a
chic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cordon bleu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>.  She puts on a crochet
blouse she had bought at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutique</ENAMEX> and a haute
couture culotte skirt, decorated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">moir√© appliqu√©s</ENAMEX>,
which is the dernier cri, a suede coat and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beret</ENAMEX>, though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fran√ßois</ENAMEX> had asked her to wear her
d√©collet√© dress.  She dabs some rouge on her cheeks
and eau de toilette on her neck.  They start off with
an ap√©ritif and some crudit√©s.  They decide to have
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">√† la carte meal</ENAMEX>, following the recommendations
of the ma√Ætre d' h√¥tel.  She has p√¢t√© for hors
d'oeuvre, while he has the soupe du jour with cro√ªtons.
For entr√©e she has the sp√©cialit√© <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la</ENAMEX> maison,
coq au vin with pommes frites and aubergines and
he has filet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mignon aux</ENAMEX> fines herbes with courgettes
and pur√©e de tomate.  They drink a carafe of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bordeaux</ENAMEX>
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX>.  For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX> she has g√¢teau and
a sorbet and he has marrons glac√©s, though, as he is
rather guache, he commits a gaffe by eating them
with his fingers and then spills most of them on his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serviette</ENAMEX>.  They finish the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> with gruy√®re and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">camembert</ENAMEX>.  They conclude with a pousse-caf√© for
her and a cognac for him.

            Afterwards they go to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et-lumi√®re</ENAMEX> show at a
nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ch√¢teau</ENAMEX>, noted for its bas-reliefs, though

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúVis-√†</ENAMEX>-vis our forthcoming marriage, you take it
as a fait accompli,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúbut I feel our dalliance

            ‚ÄúMy dear, you are merely troubled by ennui.‚Äù

            ‚ÄúI give you carte blanche to do as you like and
you go off and play the cor anglais with the conci√®rge.
What a faux pas!‚Äù

            ‚ÄúBut you could almost say it was force majeure
that drove me.  A letter I collected from the poste

√† clef she had written, showing she was au fait

would ruin me.  I had to keep up a good rapport with
her.‚Äù

            ‚ÄúI am sorry, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fran√ßois</ENAMEX>, our relationship is a

            ‚ÄúDo you mean that this is adieu?‚Äù

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúIt</ENAMEX>'s just that one has to handle these things

such awful clich√©s, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">√† la fran√ßaise</ENAMEX>, I knew it would
never work.‚Äù

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX> Shapiro [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XIV,2</NUMEX>] makes a remark
in his letter that I have often thought about, ‚Äúthe
vagaries of eponymous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Fine</ENAMEX>, indeed, for
those whose names we now associate with useful,
beautiful, or beneficial items.  Perhaps nowhere are the
vagaries of such namings more obvious than in the
medical profession.  Herein, names are most often associated
with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> rather than deliverance.  It may be
argued that more diseases have been discovered than
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cures</ENAMEX> (It could hardly be the other way around, could
it?) and that for this reason these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX> have,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nominally</ENAMEX>, cocci for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cousins</ENAMEX> and germs for germans.
Perhaps.  But could we not, for that very reason, more
rigorously associate cures or treatments with their discoverers?
Why must <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> be vaccinated?  Why
can't they be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennerated</ENAMEX> (ah, that devilish imp, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paronomasia</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intrudes</ENAMEX> again).  In reference to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shapiro</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vespasiennes</ENAMEX> .  I wonder how many common, ordinary,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">garden-variety Frenchmen</ENAMEX> would associate
these as tinkling symbols of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burgess</ENAMEX>, in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kingdom of the Wicked</ENAMEX> , remarks
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vespasian</ENAMEX>'s own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contemporaries</ENAMEX> designated street
urinals as ‚Äúvespasians,‚Äù certainly a much more ignominous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">affront</ENAMEX> because of its timeliness.  With reference
to an analogous matter, I have seen references to a real
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Crapper</ENAMEX>, who was supposed to have designed
our modern day lavatory.  I have also read an
equal number of disclaimers that pooh-pooh (as it
were) the idea of such a named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> ever having had
anything to do with the creation of this necessary convenience
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">unorthodoxymoron</NUMEX>).



         
         

            I know I'm a bit tardy in my response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen W.</ENAMEX>
Power's mistaken feminist assumption in ‚ÄúWomen
on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Language; Women</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Language‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>].  But now
that I'm once again a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> in spring training with
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX>, who is insistent on continuing to
integrate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaker Baseball League</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBL</ENAMEX>--formerly
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaker Boys League</ENAMEX>), a hardball little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX> that
will include her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-year-old</TIMEX>-male, and some female,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">equals</ENAMEX>, I find that I must correct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Power</ENAMEX>'s mistake,
caused by an obviously uniformed conjecture concerning
our language as it is used in what was formerly
an all-male game.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatter</ENAMEX> is indeed not a word used only to characterize
what ‚Äúfemales or nonhumans‚Äù speak (although
some might have accused <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yogi Berra</ENAMEX> of having the
latter status in jest).  Anyone who has ever spent any
length of time in the field for any minimal amount of
innings in the game of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>, or along the bench in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dugout</ENAMEX> next to the baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX>--and that now
includes my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX> and those like her who
insist on playing hardball rather than what is still designated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äú</ENAMEX> girls' softball‚Äù--has heard that unique baseball
language designed to get the goat of the opposition
and/or to encourage the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> on your own side.
It is called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúchatter‚Äù</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> (male), who
attempts to teach his grade-school ‚Äúpersons of summer‚Äù
the finer points of the game, and who often exhorts
them from the sidelines, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúLet</ENAMEX>'s hear a little bit of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chatter</ENAMEX>, now,‚Äù to which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX> readily and rapidly respond ‚ÄúAlright, keed,
knock it down his (or her, when applicable, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX> for the opposing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> is also female) throat‚Äù in
support of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teammate</ENAMEX> at bat, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúHit it to me,<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äù ‚ÄúMake</ENAMEX>
him hit it onna ground,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù ‚</ENAMEX>ÄúPunch him out (current jargon
for exhorting one's own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX> to put out the
opposing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">batter</ENAMEX> on strikes, known as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">strikeout)‚Äù</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suchlike</ENAMEX>.

            Feminine word play?  Try telling that to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX>'s
current favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Indian</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> baseman
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brook Jacoby</ENAMEX>.  Chatter?  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX> understands that as part
of the language of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>, the all-American game for
all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lysander Kemp</ENAMEX> reminded me of a malapropism in
Spanish which I created for myself.  When I was eight
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> moved from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buenos Aires</ENAMEX>.  My
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX>, who believed that childen should learn languages
as early as possible, dropped me into the local
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Argentine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> where I absorbed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> by a kind
of osmosis--except for one phrase.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> we sang a
song the first line of which was: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúEn los</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patios</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la</ENAMEX>

            Ipsissimum Verbum



            
               ‚Äú...A huge dark zawn, its great cliffs reddish
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">black</ENAMEX> and overhanging.  On the shingle at the
back of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">zawn</ENAMEX> lay a crumpled black <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and a
bright pink fishing buoy, small as toys against the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boulders</ENAMEX>.  I walked around the rim of the zawn.
...;‚Äù
            

            Speaking of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> right word: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>
words of text, evidently zawn has no synonym?
Context makes it general meaning clear, and specifics
are not essential.  But zawn isn't in my household
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ninth New Collegiate</ENAMEX>) , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">New International Unabridged</ENAMEX> , or several
quite specialized ones in the public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>.

            The same book repeats voe another unusual
word not in my dictionary, defined by the Unabridged
as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúan inlet</ENAMEX> or narrow bay of the...Shetland
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islands</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  The entire book is about the
Shetlands, and I accept the need for some ethnicisms,
technicisms, and colloquialisms to establish
credibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>, subject, or place.  Nor was its
use so overwhelming or constant, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúinlet‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúbay‚Äù
sometimes being substituted.
            

            Sometimes when a word is used frequently
something else happens too, and a real mess results
with a wrong word overused.  Just such an incident a
few <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> started me collecting these verbal
oddities instead of stamps or seashells.  A wrong
though somehow plausible noun, consistently and
repeatedly used throughout, distracted me from a
quite good novel.  Refectory `a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> or college
dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>' was used for rectory `the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of a
parish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX>,' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">148</NUMEX>, twice on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">151</NUMEX>, once
each on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152 and 153</NUMEX>, thrice on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX>, and so on, last
near the book's end on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">257</NUMEX>.  Eventually I concluded
even the correct word would have become
maddening from repetition, unrelieved by a synonym
or circumlocution.  The poor overworked noun
was even used where neither it nor any alternate
was needed.  ‚ÄúI'll be staying at the refectory [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rectory</ENAMEX>]
at‚Äù could surely be ‚Äúat the church in‚Äù since
only church <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quasimodo</ENAMEX> stay in the edifice
itself, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Botolph</ENAMEX>'s parish,‚Äù as no one literally
stays overnight in either a mere geographical area or
a spiritual community.  ‚ÄúThe rectory gate was the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> on the left...;.  But, as she hesitated, the
rectory door opened....  He led her into the rectory
parlor.‚Äù  All on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX>.  Why not just gate,
door, and parlor?  Is a rectory so different from any
other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>--one or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> and perhaps a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housekeeper</ENAMEX> do live there!
            

            I have no real doubt that zawn is a legitimate
and the correct word, but I question why such an
apparently obscure one is used.  Not that the practice
is uncommon.

            ‚ÄúThe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> stood back and appraised her with
a comforting smile‚Äî.  `Did you sense any warning
just before the seizure‚Äî?'

            `Yes...a very odd smell...I noticed it once
before.  At a party <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the other night</TIMEX>.  No one else
smelled it.'

            `An uncinate fit,' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> said almost under
her breath.

            `There's a technical term for that too?' ‚Äù
            

            Indeed there is, but it's again obscure, and perhaps
in a worse way.  My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household dictionary</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of the English</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">convolution</ENAMEX> containing olfactory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association centers</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
So the use was correct, but to what end?

            Sometimes a word is not so obscure.  ‚ÄúGrinning
fiercely, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jo</ENAMEX> kept his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX>...ensorceled for as
long as an hour.<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äù  My house dictionary</ENAMEX> defines ensorcel ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">matter-of-factly, ‚Äúbewitch</ENAMEX>, enchant,‚Äù dates the
word from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>, spells it with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one ‚Äú1‚Äù</NUMEX> or
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, but doesn't say why anyone would disinter it.
One book had ‚Äúa caliginous haze,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù ‚Äúeyot</ENAMEX> of firm
land,‚Äù and ‚Äúcetaceous eye.‚Äù  I had to look up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>,
and checked the last.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> were in the house
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX>.  But why are they used in a mystery
novel<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>!
            

            Occasionally an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> gracefully defines a
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">word: ‚Äúbettas</ENAMEX>--you know, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Siamese</ENAMEX> fighting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
But a few lines before: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúsyngoniums and pothos.‚Äù It
could be accounted fortuitous that I knew what bettas
were, but why choose to define that word in my
household dictionary and not the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>?  Both are
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unabridged</ENAMEX>: evidently not uncommon
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>.
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Authors</ENAMEX> put in text definitions easily forgo-able
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX> suffers tension-caused muscle
spasms his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> relieves by massage.  ‚ÄúNowadays
it's‚Äîhis bad arm‚Äî.  But formerly‚Äîit was
frequent enough for him‚Äîto feel his back had
been flogged, and she would tell him to‚Äîstretch
out flat.  That's prone: supine is the other way
round.‚Äù
            

            Which leads me to: a prig ‚Äúirritates by observance
of proprieties (as of speech) in a pointed manner
or to an obnoxious degree,‚Äù while a pedant ‚Äúunduly
emphasizes minutiae in the presentation of
knowledge.‚Äù  What
he tells us is true, but does it
matter to his book?

            Sometimes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> create words, maybe accidentally;
twice in one book seems deliberate:
‚Äúsearched‚Äîacross the rooves of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York‚Äù</ENAMEX> and
‚Äúred tilted rooves of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  The same book has ‚ÄúI
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dreampt</ENAMEX> and I was the dream which dreampt itself.‚Äù
Unless I'm missing a classical allusion, why is it not
just dreamt ?  The dictionary says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúhoofs</ENAMEX>, rarely
hooves‚Äù but only <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúroofs‚Äù</ENAMEX>; perhaps we tend to pronounce
it as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúrooves</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  As indeed I can, if I choose
to, hear the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúp‚Äù in ‚Äúdreamt</ENAMEX>,‚Äù as in unkempt and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tempt</ENAMEX>.
            

            Then we have ‚Äúevery sort of forcep.‚Äù  The singular
is forceps ; the plural forceps , or rarely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forcepses</ENAMEX> .  Not like some other usually plural nouns,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scissor</ENAMEX> hold or cut , a wollen trouser , maybe even a
lace-trimmed panty , but no sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚Äúforcep‚Äù</ENAMEX>!
            

            Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offense</ENAMEX> is using verbs as nouns.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúIt</ENAMEX>'s
only temporary disableds need assistance.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Scot</ENAMEX>'s
speech explains the elliptical style, and the best fix
might be, ‚ÄúTemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cripples</ENAMEX>.‚Äù If one can't abide
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúcripples</ENAMEX>,‚Äù perhaps ‚Äúthe temporarily disabled‚Äù
might be both grammatical and still ‚Äúin voice.‚Äù
            

            Sometimes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> simply uses the wrong word:
‚ÄúBut it's part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of an infinite recession
that the final box is much too small to open or even
see.  And anyway, there isn't one.‚Äù  Indeed not in a
recession ; try an infinite regression !  I am also dubious
of ‚ÄúThere is a lesion between hope and recollection,
into which my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirit</ENAMEX> had slipped‚Äî.‚Äù  Are <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>
between things?  Can you really slip into one?
            

            Or consider: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúKate‚Äîexplained‚Äîthe scars</ENAMEX>
‚Äîwere the result of a car accident in which her
hands had been pinched.  This she did unblushingly,
though both `accident' and `pinch' were retrospective
aggrandizements, her hands having been quite
deliberately slammed in a car door, twice each.‚Äù
Someone ought to blush, because whatever they are,
they are not aggrandizements, ‚Äúthings made to appear
greater.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äù  ‚Äú Retrogressive</ENAMEX> aggrandizements,‚Äù
maybe, but that's an oxymoron of another colour entirely.

            Some errors are harder to see but just as surely
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mistaken: ‚</ENAMEX>ÄúI frowned at the coffee <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">percolator</ENAMEX>, which
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äîfinally</ENAMEX> began to perk.  I cradled the telephone between
shoulder and ear, poured, and‚Äîtook a sip of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  What should but doesn't follow is, ‚ÄúAnd then
quickly spit out the colorless, tasteless gulp of hot
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Coffee</ENAMEX> isn't ready to drink when it begins but
when it finishes perking.  Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> evidently
doesn't make his own, or at least not using a percolator.
It is a paranoid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> who even keeps secret how
he makes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>--shades of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.D. Salinger</ENAMEX>!
            

            Complex situations create subtle errors.  ‚ÄúPhyllis
stood at the far end....  When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joanna</ENAMEX> spoke her
name, she turned, reaching for a pair of hornrimmed
glasses‚Äîsetting them on the bridge of
her nose‚Äî.  She hurried over‚Äîthen removed
the glasses--which were for farsightedness--and
plunked them back on top of her head.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  And</ENAMEX> later:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúWhen Joanna</ENAMEX> glanced back at her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> from the
door, she saw that she had her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">glasses</ENAMEX> perched on
her nose and was staring after her with worried
eyes.‚Äù  For implies purpose or explanation: glasses
for `to achieve' or for `because of' [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">farsightedness</ENAMEX>].
Used about physical vision, farsighted and nearsighted
are not gifts like quick-footedness or nightvision,
or neutral like lefthandedness, but defects,
each defined comparatively.  Nearsightedness, the
ability to see near things more clearly than distant
ones, is basically defective vision of distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farsightedness</ENAMEX> is the ability to see distant things
quite normally, but ipso facto , the inability to see
near ones well.  Why then does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phyllis</ENAMEX> put her
glasses on to see things across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and remove
them when near the objects of her scrutiny?  Because
she is nearsighted, and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">glasses</ENAMEX> ought to be
for nearsightedness.  Her eyes looked worried because
she was wearing the wrong <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">glasses</ENAMEX>!  They were
indeed for ‚Äúseeing at a distance,‚Äù but that's not what
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">farsightedness</ENAMEX> means.
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Writers</ENAMEX> sometimes leave themselves open to inadvertent
double meaning.  In a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detective</ENAMEX> novel: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúI</ENAMEX>
bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bud</ENAMEX> light to go with my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwich and‚</ENAMEX>Äî
did some ruminating while I ate.‚Äù  Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cows</ENAMEX> also
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ruminate</ENAMEX> while eating, the issue is whether it is over
the toughness of the case or of the roast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pastrami sandwich</ENAMEX>.
            

            It is even possible that sometimes the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> right
word may be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more!  ‚ÄúTyranny is funny; not
actual tyranny but the attempts of tyrants to cover
up their tyrannousness.<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äù  My dictionary</ENAMEX> approves tyrannicalness ,
though I wouldn't really use that word
either.  How about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúoppressive tendency‚Äù</ENAMEX> or even
tyranny once again?
            

            An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> may miss the mark with an expression.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúLorimer</ENAMEX> wondered whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äî</ENAMEX> had sent him out as a sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stalking lamb</ENAMEX>, to see
what reaction he would stir up.‚Äù Or perhaps a tethered
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parakeet</ENAMEX>, sacrificial tortoise, or <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Judas rabbit</ENAMEX>?  It
should be <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äústalking horse</ENAMEX> ,‚Äù of course, of course!

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúI</ENAMEX> shall simply talk quietly to old Harwell like a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX>....‚Äù  Even if youngish <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Simpson</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>, could not readily speak to
old Harwell like a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX> , the usual expression,
why not just resist the temptation to make an (at
best) bad pun?
            

            Even in word-portraits of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> turn
unhappy phrases: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúHis eyes seemed filled with spit
and vinegar.<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äù  Hard</ENAMEX> to say what that means, except
stinging eyes, and besides, using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
clich√©s is simply spilt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> off a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX>'s back on troubled
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>: isn't it ‚Äúspit and polish‚Äù and ‚Äúpiss and
vinegar?‚Äù
            

            To end on an uplifting note: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúFor an hour the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lecture</ENAMEX> was heavy with the importance of dream
state, pulse and heart rate, vaginal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumescence</ENAMEX> and
temperature change, rapid eye movement and the
size and frequency of penal erection.‚Äù  The word,
clearly, is penile , from penis; penal comes from the
lantin poena `pain or punishment.'  A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> riot is
not a penile, but a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">penal</ENAMEX> uprising; and erections, unless
some subtle word play about painfulness or punishment
is intended, are not penal but penile.

            What Gall



            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parisian</ENAMEX> advertising copywriter has been sentenced
to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> for an ad campaign
in which he premeditatedly employed an archaic
tense of a verb that appears on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cultural Ministry</ENAMEX>'s Index of Officially Proscribed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franglaisms</ENAMEX>.  He has also been sentenced to a concurrent
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight-year term</TIMEX> for using the verb in an
anachronistic context.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucien Ma√Ætre-Cr√©che</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48-year-old</TIMEX> copywriter
specializing in fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">accounts</ENAMEX>, was found
guilty by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of
deliberately using the imperfect subjunctive tense of
the franglaism jumbo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">frankfurter</ENAMEX> in a series of ads
posted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paris Metro</ENAMEX> system.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jumbo Frankfurter</ENAMEX>
is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> corruption of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> expression
jumbo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">frankfurter</ENAMEX> , and is used in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> as a verb
meaning, literally, `to eat a large hot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>.'

            The expression is one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has forbidden in all official
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX>, as well as in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> advertising.
Legal penalties vary according to the context in
which the word is used, the gender (in the case of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nouns</ENAMEX>), and the tense and mood (in the case of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">verbs</ENAMEX>).  Thus, while it is a misdemeanor to employ
the expression jumbo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">frankfurter</ENAMEX> in public discourse,
to date <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> has been charged with the
offense: a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Libyan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist</ENAMEX> who asked for a large hot
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> during his arraignment for blowing up an art
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dijon</ENAMEX>.  Ma√Ætre-Cr√©che, on the other
hand, was charged with a felony, punishable by a
maximum prison sentence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 years</TIMEX>, because the
term was not used in ‚Äúthe ephemeral, innocuous
context of speech,‚Äù according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX>, but
in the ‚Äúsemi-non-ephemeral, culturally reverberative
context of advertising.‚Äù  He will begin serving
his sentence immediately.

            The cause of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma√Ætre-Cr√©che</ENAMEX>'s legal troubles was
a poster depicting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rabelais</ENAMEX>' famous comic figure
Gargantua staring forlornly at an empty hot-dog roll
and sighing, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúQue j'eusse bien aim√©</ENAMEX> jumbo frankfurther
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">aujourd'hui!‚Äù</ENAMEX> [`<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boy</ENAMEX>, I could have really gone
for a big hot dog <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>!']  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministry</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cultural Recidivism</ENAMEX>, alarmed that the proliferation
of the posters could create an unfortunate conception
in the minds of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> that the imperfect
subjunctive tense of the verb jumbo frankfurter
dated all the way back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rabelaisian</ENAMEX> times--thus
lending the expression a certain historical pedigree--immediately
ordered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">copywriter</ENAMEX>'s arrest.

the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> blamed the whole flap on a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">printer</ENAMEX>'s error, maintaining that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX>'s original

tense of the verb:  <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúUn de ces jours, on jumbo

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> around here will be eating big hot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>.']  The
use of the future tense carries a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$12,000</NUMEX> fine, but no
prison sentence.  But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">printer</ENAMEX> denied the allegation,
and as no copy of the mislaid print order was

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">perjured</ENAMEX> himself.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long</ENAMEX> and the Short of It




            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Polysyllables</ENAMEX> abound in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s speech, and
much has been written on the subject, from euphemisms--agencies
that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúfacilitate‚Äù</ENAMEX> instead of give
money--to downright deceit--one knows by now
that ‚Äúprotective reaction strikes‚Äù are bombings.  As
with so many trends spotted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguistic police</ENAMEX>,
however, this is hardly new.  Ever since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">invasion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have preferred to use the longer
Latinate terms over the blunt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Saxon</ENAMEX> words:
the general feeling, with some small basis, is that
such diction shows a touch of class.  A more puzzling
phenomenon is the use of long forms for which quite
similar shorter forms already exist.  The general idea
behind this trend seems to be that in length there is
strength, even at the cost of accuracy.  Examples, unfortunately,
are all too easy to provide.

            The usage of these words is easy to spot: they all
have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an extra</NUMEX> syllable or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> that adds little but excess
bulk (for usage , delete and substitute use ).  Reporters
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York Times</ENAMEX> , for example, often
write of ‚Äúsubsidization programs,‚Äù when subsidy
will do just as well.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suffix - ization</ENAMEX> , which indicates
`process,' is often in demand, since it makes
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> think something is actively being done.  Other
suffixes such as - tion, -ate, and - ment are equally popular
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">add-ons</ENAMEX>.  Thus, estimates turn into estimations,
and television anchormen these days encapsulate the
news instead of encapsule it.  This is a society that
lives beyond its limitations rather than its limits.
When forced, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> take preventative measures instead
of preventive ones.  In some instances, the
shorter forms have all but dropped from use.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phrase ‚Äúhe</ENAMEX> is in my employ ‚Äù is now considered either
old-fashioned or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>: most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would automatically
change the key word to employment .

            The adjectival suffix - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX> is often slapped on
words that already are adjectives.  Why must people
be ironical instead of ironic , or satirical instead of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">satiric</ENAMEX> ?  The - ate suffix, originally a harmless suffix to
denote causative verbs such as substantiate from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX>,
is particularly pernicious.  Not too long ago,
the personnel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> would orient
new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> (the word originally meant to point out
where the sun rose; i.e., which way was east).  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Nowadays,</ENAMEX>
of course, the overbriefed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newcomers</ENAMEX> are orientated ,
a longer verb that sounds suspiciously like a
back-formation from orientation .  Similarly, derivate
looks like an up-and-coming contender for derive .
Proceeding analogously, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmate</ENAMEX> of mine in junior
high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> once talked of improvisating, but
somehow her neologism never caught on.

            Often, such lengthening leads to subtle errors.
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> no longer form methods , for instance,
but instead formulate methodologies .  How much
more comforting to have a methodology behind one
than a mere method!  The word methodology , however,
really refers to the science of method itself,
while formulate means to `reduce to a formula'
rather than to `shape.'  The words are apt for scientific
testing, not for dealing with a simple problem--
though of course that's precisely the point: using
these words gives a pseudo-scientific boost, a spurious
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exactitude</ENAMEX>.  For this reason, perhaps, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologists</ENAMEX>
will talk of societal needs: social may sound too soft,
too much like a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>.  The same goes for specialty,
which has yielded over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> to specialization .
The curious point is that this trend seems to
go against <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Zipf's Law</ENAMEX>, which notes that syllables get
trimmed off words over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>.  Here, one may
observe the opposite happening: when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> wish
to spruce up an old word, they add a syllable.

            Admittedly, certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have their particular
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vocabulary</ENAMEX>.  The legal profession is notorious for its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polysyllabification</ENAMEX> (a self-descriptive term).  One
reads about the issuance of government regulations
in place of their issue .  In these regulations, hereby
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">herewith</ENAMEX> often crowd out the sufficient here; in
fact, as an honest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> will tell you, these words
are pro forma and could be omitted entirely.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marx Brothers</ENAMEX> understood legalese quite well, augmenting
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúthe</ENAMEX> first part‚Äù to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúthe <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which
becomes ‚Äúthe part of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù ‚</ENAMEX>Äúthe <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part,‚Äù and far worse in the
course of an exchange in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Night at the Opera</ENAMEX>.  The
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> part-icipants end, incidentally, by tearing out
everything in the contract but the place for a signature.

            In all fairness, many drafters of legal documents
are probably just after terms without strongly positive
or negative connotations.  The addition of suffixes
generally makes the word in question more abstract:
use can smack of exploitation, while usage
sounds more neutral.  One can speak of part and
party without reference to gender, race, and so on.
Presumably, one should have a fine sense of discrimination
in language to avoid discrimination in law.

            Should one wish to begin syllable-hunting, one
must also have a sensitive ear.  Is aggression the same
as aggressiveness , or, on the other side of the spectrum,
is passivity the same as passiveness ?  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is
more the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> more the behaviour--but
how about scarcity and scarceness ?  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> runs into the
same problem with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">- ing gerund</ENAMEX> versus the - ation
nouns: which sounds better, implementing or implementation,
ratifying or ratification?  In opting for the
gerunds, one often saves a syllable or more, but the
specific, continuous action of a gerund may not be so
attractive to a society fuzzily focused on process.

            Syllable-cutting, to its credit, promotes sharper
thinking and concision--not conciseness --in
speech.  A word of caution, however: as with forming
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palindromes</ENAMEX> or anagrams in one's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, it can
become a mania more likely to promote insomnia as
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> searches for additional examples, more grist for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">linguistic mill</ENAMEX>.  One oddity the syllable-cutter is
bound to come across in his explorations is the twosome
stemming from a common root.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sate</ENAMEX> and Satiate
are perhaps the most blatant instance: the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are
synonymous in most dictionaries, the form from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> satiare , `to satisfy.'  On the other hand, is rite
the same as ritual ?  How about deprecate and depreciate ,
or cave and cavern ?  In fact, a large overlap
links each twosome, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duo</ENAMEX> (or duad ).  <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>,
which abhors a vacuum even more than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nature</ENAMEX>
does, produced a plenum here.

            Finally, one must be wary of elongation that
carries with it a distinctly different meaning.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adulterer</ENAMEX> and the adulterator may both be reprehensible
but should not otherwise be confused.  Simple is
one thing, simplistic another; the same is true of the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjectives</ENAMEX> express and expressive .  The words
economic and economical share the meaning ‚Äúof
money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>,‚Äù but the latter also means
`thrifty.'  To shift fields: art movements, in particular,
often identify themselves through the addition of a
syllable to a word in common parlance.  Formalist art
is not the same as formal art, and though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce</ENAMEX> is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Modernist</ENAMEX>, he is no longer quite modern.  As a syllable-cutter,
I leave alone such distinctions and go on
to easier prey, such as contest-draw versus contest-drawing.
As for challenges, I am currently looking
for a word that can be cut into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> successively
smaller forms.

            Syllable-cutters may even adopt a familiar
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">credo</ENAMEX>.  Following the directive of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Strunk</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">immortal ‚ÄúOmit</ENAMEX> needless words,‚Äù one may tape
above one's word processor, ‚ÄúSlash excess syllables.‚Äù
I admit, at times I think, why bother?  The pay
is low to nonexistent, the number of scowls from
others enough to darken <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any day</TIMEX>.  But then there are
the occasional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who respond gratefully, who
may even go on to proselytize to others the virtue in
clearing away excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">verbiage</ENAMEX>, token of muddled
thought.  It may be a thankless task, but it can lead to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gracefulness</ENAMEX>--or rather, grace.
            This example, I note, shows letter-cutting
rather than syllable-cutting.

            Language is an enduring contest for dominion
between ancient usage and demands for adequate
expression of our modern quest for novelty.
Survival of old phrases and definitions is encouraged
by poverty and social isolation, which sustain traditions,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linguistic</ENAMEX> and otherwise.  Since such conditions
are not limited by geography, old speech has been
remarkably hardy in resisting as well as absorbing
the new.

            Non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> coming into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
are often puzzled or amazed by the speech of their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and some publish lists of what they hear,
without always appreciating its origin.  Elaborate taxonomies
and obscure explanations such as mispronunciation
due to ignorance, malapropisms based on
both ignorance and misunderstanding, and, for the
dictated word, the technological dyslexia of typographical
errors and poor grasp of the diction of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictators</ENAMEX> of medical histories may be suggested.
Lists of typographical errors, collected from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX>, are often posted on bulletin boards and are
occasionally published.  Some rather startling and
provocative associations result: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venus</ENAMEX> insufficiency ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phi Beta Capita</ENAMEX>, sin eruptions, positive throat structure
(`culture').

            Appreciation and survival of both typos and
many common terms may be directly related to the
nature and intensity of sexual reference.  Take sin
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eruption</ENAMEX> and the variety of vulgar expressions for describing
the pathological consequences of sexual encounters.
The curious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collector</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> folk usages
of this type need only consult the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">English Dictionary</ENAMEX> for enlightenment about the origin
and the longevity of language.  In the following
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paragraphs</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> recorded use given in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> is indicated in parentheses.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grind</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>) early attained its modern definition,
to `rub against or to work into,' but by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1400</TIMEX> its
anatomical meaning--a `lower abdominal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quadrant</ENAMEX>'--had
given way to groin , our modern usage.
Not until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1625</TIMEX> was groin identified as the seat of lust
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>).  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grine</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1400</TIMEX>) was then a `noose, halter, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">snare</ENAMEX>,' as well as an obsolete form of grin , perhaps a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pre-Columbian</ENAMEX> leer, and of grine as groin , a use still
prevalent in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Appalachia</ENAMEX>.

            While bumps (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1592</TIMEX>) as `gestures of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">concupiscence</ENAMEX>'
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1340</TIMEX>) are now automatically associated with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grinds</ENAMEX>, our ancestors used many words to describe
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lumps</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1475</TIMEX>) in the skin.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wen</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>), boil (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>),
and kernels (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>) as currently in ‚Äúkernels in my
grine,‚Äù are the oldest, but pimple (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1400</TIMEX>), rising
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1563</TIMEX>), bealing (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1605</TIMEX>), and gland (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1692</TIMEX>) are also
still used to designate small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nonvenereal masses</ENAMEX>.  Cutaneous
manifestations of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">venereal disease</ENAMEX> have
been variously identified, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early as bubo</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1398</TIMEX>), a
`swelling in the groin or axilla.'  Thus the form of
plague characterized by such regional swelling became
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bubonic</ENAMEX> to distinguish it from the pneumonic
form.  Later bubo came to refer almost exclusively to
the inguinal swelling of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">venereal disease</ENAMEX>, along the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> being corrupted to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúblue balls‚Äù as in the colorful
epithet, blue-balled bastard.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balls</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1352</TIMEX>) of
course stand for `testes.'  The `inguinal lesion of primary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">syphilis'</ENAMEX> is usually a chancre (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1605</TIMEX>).  Its most
descriptive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX>, haircut , not included in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> , occurs only in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, blamed on being cut by
stiff female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> hair.

            Since many <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">venereal diseases</ENAMEX>, most frequently
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gonorrhea</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1547</TIMEX>), result in purulent urethral drainage,
many vulgar terms for this phenomenon survive.
Gonorrhea itself was first a word for the discharge
before it came to describe the disease when
bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">causation</ENAMEX> was determined.  Left on the
street were such synonyms as gleet (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1340</TIMEX>), clap
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1587</TIMEX>), and running ranes or raines (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1588</TIMEX>).  Gleet
was originally described as a `slimy matter' (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1400</TIMEX>),
sticky or greasy, characteristically as `phlegm collected
in the stomach, especially of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawk</ENAMEX>.'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phlegm</ENAMEX> eventually came to refer to mucus (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1662</TIMEX>)
and to be hawked (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1604</TIMEX>) from the sinuses or lungs of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with respiratory tract irritation or infection.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Ray</ENAMEX>, the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> and pioneer
lexicographer, author of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Collection of English Proverbs</ENAMEX>
(<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> edition <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1670</TIMEX>, second edition <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1678</TIMEX>) and
Collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Words</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> edition <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1673</TIMEX>, second
edition <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1691</TIMEX>), suffered severely from an ulcerative
disease of his legs.  He reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1704</TIMEX> that
‚Äúpart of the skin of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of my insteps by degrees has
turned black and now as with the flesh under it it is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rotted</ENAMEX> and corrupted...yet runs a copious gleet.‚Äù

            
               Strain (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1588</TIMEX>), in the sense of `trickle,' as a painful
or slow urination came early to refer to urethral
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX>.  Its precursor was the now quite obsolete
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strangury</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1398</TIMEX>) `slow and painful urination.'  In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1532</TIMEX> strain came also to imply compulsion, manifested
in urethritis by urgency and frequency with
scant flow.  Thus evolution of meanings assumed by
strain can be easily traced.

            Some early words for sexual intercourse (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1798</TIMEX>)
as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">congress</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1589</TIMEX>) persist although considerably
modified in meaning.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1315</TIMEX>) is another, although
artificial insemination is inexorably driving
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cows</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bulls</ENAMEX> from the lea of language.

shares with swinging (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1400</TIMEX>), a sense of motion,
the former deriving from swivel (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1307</TIMEX>), a coupling
device which accounts for the swivel chair.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> does not include swivel hips but many
school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> were once called, out of earshot,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúMiss Swiviel Hips‚Äù</ENAMEX> and the thought expressed, ‚ÄúI'd
like to have that swing on my porch.‚Äù  the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> says
nothing about swivet either, but in a swivet has
meant `hot and bothered' for generations in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New Collegiate Dictionary</ENAMEX> does recognize
in a swivet but neither its age nor derivation,

or rotatory action of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>' came by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1584</TIMEX> to
imply `freedom of action.'  Both swiving and swinging
require sexual vigor and inclination, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1541</TIMEX>
known as courage , so that ‚ÄúI got no courage ‚Äù is more
time-honored than ‚ÄúI'm impotent ‚Äù (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1615</TIMEX>).  Some refer
to this difficulty as ‚Äúlosing my nature ‚Äù (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1386</TIMEX>),
and impotence recorded in the medical history often
undergoes technological transformation to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúimportance,‚Äù</ENAMEX>

family life, but not about the family life itself.
