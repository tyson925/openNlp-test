            To <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polonius</ENAMEX>' query, What do you read, my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lord</ENAMEX>?, my answer would have been Words,
words and their final meanings if I had played
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamlet</ENAMEX> in the latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>, with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Johnson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX> in my hand.  I would
have taken in good earnest the definitions of those
entries that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> usually quote for gratuitous
pleasure but dismiss as crotchety.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-19th</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, however, I should have replied, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Words</ENAMEX>,
words and their provisional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">meanings</ENAMEX>, with reference
to the opposite and, at times, equally crotchety
definitions of the same entries, reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noah Webster</ENAMEX>'s
An <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">American Dictionary of the English Language</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1828</TIMEX>) on the stage.  On the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> occasion I
would have grown somewhat circumspect about dictionary
meaning not simply because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> diverge so widely, but because meaning per
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">se</ENAMEX> is determined by relative historical and ideological
conditions.

            It is a commonplace that dictionary is the mark of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> and the standard.  That the standard is collectively
agreed upon through convention and practice
is another truism.  But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectivity</ENAMEX> can be a problematic
concept since it does not cover all in society
as far as fixing the linguistic standard is concerned.
Given that society is heavily stratified into classes and
ranks, all those living in it do not have a uniform level
of literacy and the same degree of access to the process
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linguistic standardization</ENAMEX>.  As this process is
controlled by the culturally and politically dominant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>, the ideology of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dictionary adapts</ENAMEX> itself
to the dominant ideology at all points of time.  Since
wide acceptability is the goal of ideology, it makes its
cultural and political agenda invisible and makes itself
look natural and objective.  The giant publishing
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> turning out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX>
of dictionaries of various sizes and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinds</ENAMEX> always regard
objectivity and fidelity to actual usage as ideals
and marketability as the end.  In practice, indiscreet
lapses from objectivity do occur nonetheless, and the
market suffers occasional setbacks.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years ago</TIMEX>,
an edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">English dictionary</ENAMEX> had included
in its definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> with a lot
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitutes</ENAMEX>.  Provoked by this, Chulalongkorn
University in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX> and the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bookstores</ENAMEX>
there decided to boycott the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>.

            Another event that clearly illustrates how ideological
conditions determine meanings of words in a
dictionary occurred when the twentieth edition of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Duden dictionary</ENAMEX> came out.  This was the first
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionary</ENAMEX> to be published after the unification
of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germanys</ENAMEX>.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX>, the definition
of capitalism , among many others, read in
conflicting ways in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duden</ENAMEX> dictionaries in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX>, which was natural considering
their opposed political and ideological dispositions.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> translation they are as follows:


a social formation based upon exploitation of
the labourers through private property and production
means

[<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX> Duden <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>]

            

            Then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> goes on to hint at the notoriety of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tories</ENAMEX> by tracing the word <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tory</ENAMEX> back to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish</ENAMEX>
word meaning robber or bandit.  As for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>,
he believed it to be a cant term, derived...from
an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> word signifying a savage.  Here <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>
confers on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tories</ENAMEX> the distinction of being the
true <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> politics and religion,
although one should not forget that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whigs</ENAMEX>, too,
believed in the constitution of the state equally well
and used the same rhetoric for their own publicity.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s role in this context was only to tarnish
the image of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tories</ENAMEX> and brighten that of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whigs</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson dismissively</ENAMEX> defines <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whig</ENAMEX> as the name
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faction</ENAMEX> and spitefully remarks that the term
derives from whigamore denoting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">south-west</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>, whose poverty
drove them to rise against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">royal</ENAMEX> authority etc.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>, on the contrary, stubbornly
maintains that the origin of the word is unknown
and shows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whigs</ENAMEX> in a favourable light by
presenting them as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> of popular
rights during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">English Civil War</ENAMEX> and as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> of the war and principles of
revolution during the revolution in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tories</ENAMEX> and Whigs
were engaged in a battle of rhetoric, each group
claiming monopoly of the custodianship of constitutional
democracy and national tradition.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>,
similarly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Federalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">party</ENAMEX> were contesting with each other
for the exclusive title of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> to the constitution
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>.  Thus polarization
in politics had led to proliferation of partisan
political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">meanings</ENAMEX>.  Claims and denials as well as vilification
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> and self-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">glorification</ENAMEX> characterized
political discourse both in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> at different times.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>
took up political positions that turned out to be antagonistic
irrespective of the gap in space and time.
For each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them the dictionary was a site of
political struggle clearly signifying ideological underpinnings.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ideology</ENAMEX> surely informs meaning.  If meaning
appears neutral, as it does in the modern dictionaries,
it is only so following the dictates of objectivity,
an ideology in itself, and the politics of invisibility.


economic and social order whose driving force
is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> earning profit

[<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> Duden <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>]

            

            After the unification, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX> definition
predictably featured in the new dictionary, displacing
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX>.  Also, many
words and usages exiled from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany</ENAMEX> now
found a place as free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> in the world of linguistic
glasnost, which this dictionary represented.  A
few of them are Republikflucht leaving the country
illegally, meinungs freiheit freedom of opinion,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wettreise</TIMEX> journey around the world, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freizeit</ENAMEX> leisure
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stasi</ENAMEX> secret <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>.  Indeed, the
changing socio-political and historical conditions determine
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">origin</ENAMEX>, currency, and extinctions of words as
well as their meanings.  Conversely, the words and
meanings determine these conditions.

            To return to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>, we may cite
pension, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tory</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whig</ENAMEX> as illustrative samples of a
good many politically charged entries.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX>, pension is defined thus:


In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> it is generally given to a state hireling
for treason to his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.

            

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Webster's American Dictionary</ENAMEX> , it reads:


An <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> allowance of a sum of money to a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in consideration of the
past services, civil or military.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> often receive
pensions for eminent services on retiring from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>.  But in particular, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> and sea
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> receive pension when they are disabled for
further services.
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s terse and narrow definition reveals his
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tory</ENAMEX> opposition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whigs</ENAMEX>, who normally were
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.  In his time they were seen as arms
of a growing and ever more intrusive governmental
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX>, to quote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert De Maria, Jr.</ENAMEX>'s The
Politics of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>, [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMLA</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vol.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">104</ENAMEX>,
No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 1989</TIMEX>) p. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX>].  But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s elaborate
and labored definition is an argument for pension.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1780s</TIMEX> there had been a nation-wide protest
against grant of pension by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>
who had served in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Army</ENAMEX> during the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Independence</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Convention of</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protesters</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Middletown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, demanded
repeal of pension.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> rose to its defense
and contended that the social unrest had been
caused by a misrepresentation of the word.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People</ENAMEX>
did not distinguish between pension granted as a
provision for old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> and pension granted for the
purpose of bribery for favor and support.  He maintained
that pension was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> pay for ex-officers.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tory</ENAMEX> is defined in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX> as


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> who adheres to the ancient constitution of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, and the apostolical hierarchy of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of England</ENAMEX>.
            

            It contrasts sharply with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s definition:

The name given to an adherent to the ancient
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constitution of England</ENAMEX> and to the apostolical hierarchy.
The tories form a party which are [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX>]
charged with supporting more arbitrary principles
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whigs</ENAMEX>, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> during the revolution, those
who opposed the war, and favored the claims of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Britain</ENAMEX> were called tories.
            
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Horse Words</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motor Age</ENAMEX>



            The replacement of animal power by motors has
vastly changed social life in many ways; yet language
is conservative, and horse words have survived
the loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> very well, remaining in the general
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vocabulary</ENAMEX> to be widely used without horsey <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>
even among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have nothing to do
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>.  Many of these words are used figuratively,
and others have simply transferred their meanings
to modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and conditions, especially
those having to do with rail and motor transport.

            Our most basic expressions for transportation
are traceable to horse imagery.  We drive motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX>
as we once drove <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>; indeed, until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX>,
the very question Can you drive?  meant Do you
know how to drive <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>?  We ride in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> as
we ride <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> -- even the word <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is rooted in
ride.  Street is from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> via strata , a paved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>,
a phrase whose own history mirrors the relation of
ride and road: via <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is cognate not only with our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> , but with a whole set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latinate</ENAMEX> words suggesting
movement: vehement, convey , and even vehicle
itself; just as way is related to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wag</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon</ENAMEX> .

            We can scarcely talk about motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> without
using words that originally applied to horse-drawn
ones.  Vehicle itself is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> vehiculum a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX>;
and even the early automobilist heard his machine
called a horseless <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX> , just as the early
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">railroader</ENAMEX> heard his called an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iron Horse</ENAMEX> , which of
course drew carriages of its own.  (Apt names, actually:
a chuffing steam train starting or stopping really
does sound like an excited <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>; and the earliest
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">railway</ENAMEX> carriages, like the earliest motorcars, looked
very much like their horse-drawn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>, having
been built by the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX>.)  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Train</ENAMEX> recalls
the image of a pack-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> , a string of the packhorses
who carried much of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s freight before good
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>; and the very strength of machinery has long
been measured in horsepower , significantly shortened
simply to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> .

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Car</ENAMEX> , the plainest of our motor-vehicle words,
has a complicated history.  Originally <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celtic</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">wagon</ENAMEX> , it was borrowed into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> as carre , yielding not only the verb
carry and its abstract <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX> , but also cargo,
charge, chariot.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cart</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> are not related to it,
the first being <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anglo-Saxon</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> named
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kocs</ENAMEX> , an early manufactory.)
Early modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> poetically for
the chariots of the sun and planets, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milton</ENAMEX>'s
image of a maritime <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">sunset in Comus: And the</ENAMEX>
gilded <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> of day / His glowing axle doth allay / In
the steep <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> stream.

            In Victorian <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> was quickly applied to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">railway</ENAMEX> carriages, whence boxcars and passenger<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">-cars</ENAMEX> ,
and also to tramways, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to horsecars and then
to electric-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> , otherwise known as trolley <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> , or
streetcars , or simply <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> (whence carfare ).  Until the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1900s</TIMEX>, to ride the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> meant to take a tram,
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> was used as sobriquet for an
average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> .  When
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobiles</ENAMEX> were introduced, someone coined motorcar .
When this in turn shortened to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> , the word
assumed its modern sense, which soon overtook all
the others.

            Most other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> words transferred their
meanings from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> to motor with less fuss.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rig</ENAMEX>
once applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagons</ENAMEX>; so did truck and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart lorry</ENAMEX> .  Farming implements like plow
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hayrake</ENAMEX> have kept their old horse-drawn names,
and so have most utility <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX>, like fire engine,
Black <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria</ENAMEX>, paddy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ambulance</ENAMEX> , and delivery
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van</ENAMEX> --the last clipped from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caravan</ENAMEX> living <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon</ENAMEX>,
which survives in full in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> to mean a camping
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trailer</ENAMEX>.  Bus is clipped from omnibus , which means
for everybody in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>: it was a slang term for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">horse-drawn</ENAMEX> public transport of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1800s</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cab</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxicab</ENAMEX> is from cabriolet , a light passenger
cart; and hack is hackney <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> for hire,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hackney</ENAMEX> or hack being a hired <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> and by extension
anything shoddy and overused, whence hack-word
and hackneyed phrases.  Liberal generous
yielded livery stables , which hired out horses as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">to-day</ENAMEX>'s
livery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> hire out <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">limousines</ENAMEX>.

            In describing mechanical contrivances, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> continue to use their word <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wagen</ENAMEX> to mean
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagen</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX> has
the compound <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">station wagon</ENAMEX> , originally a horse vehicle
for fetching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at train <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
call <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">station wagons estate cars</ENAMEX> , but they refer to
freight <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> as goods <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagons</ENAMEX> (borrowed
into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> as plain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon</ENAMEX> , also used in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagons</ENAMEX>-lits ,
the sleeping <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> on old trains like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orient Express</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carriage</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> are also rail terms <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX>;
but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> still use dual carriageway for the kind
of road <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> call a divided <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> , and coach
remains in use both as a euphemism for a longdistance
bus and somewhat bizarrely as the name
for the cheap seats on an airplane.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> gives us
porte-coch√®re , originally a porch under which one
entered a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX>.  We modernize this in the loan-translation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carport</ENAMEX> .

            With <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>, wagons carry freight and have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">wheels;</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> may carry anything but have two
wheels.  A passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX> ; if it has
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> wheels and is light and cheap it is also a buggy ,
and if heavy and enclosed, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX>.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sleds</ENAMEX> are wagons
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX>, and sleighs are carriages with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX>,
though the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> use sledge for both.)  Two
points stand out about these words.  First, many are
still used in their own right, but in trivialized senses:
little red <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagons</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, go-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">golf carts</ENAMEX> and
shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> (all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two</NUMEX>-wheeled, though,
called shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trolleys</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>),  <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> bobsleds
and sleds for coasting down hills, dune buggies
for zooming around beaches, and even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> carriages
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby buggies</ENAMEX> .  <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the suggestion of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">towing</ENAMEX> has vanished in the modern uses of these
words, except in the train senses, for we call anything
towed behind a motor vehicle a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trailer</ENAMEX> .  We
even have horse <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trailers</ENAMEX> for transporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> --
putting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>, so to speak, though
I have never heard anyone mention the irony in this.

            Most of the old names for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX>' constituent
parts persist in our newer machines too: wheels and
tires and axles and brakes and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">springs</TIMEX> , of course; but
also the collective name for all this stuff, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">under</NUMEX>-carriage
now applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX> and even
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">airplanes</ENAMEX>!  (The undercarriage was also called the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gear</ENAMEX> , whence landing gear .)  Steering wheels and
steering itself were originally boat words, and hubs
and spokes persist in metaphors and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX> more
than in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> (except for hubcaps ).  But cartwheel was
kept as a nickname for a silver dollar, and it also
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">charmingly</ENAMEX> describes a playful whirling jump.

            Many names also survive from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX>.
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carriages</ENAMEX> had folding tops , exactly like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">convertibles</ENAMEX>.  The oldest enclosed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX> originally
had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> passenger seats facing each other, an arrangement
preserved in the compartments of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
trains; but later <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX> often had only one
enclosed seat, as if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> had been cut -- or in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, coup√© .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coachwork</ENAMEX> still means bodywork;
and at least in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> the luggage compartment at
the rear is still called a trunk (it once really was a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trunk</ENAMEX>, as you can see in pictures of old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX> and
even old motorcars).  The horn is the literal and figurative
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendant</ENAMEX> of the post horn , the spiral horn
that was carried by a mail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> to announce its arrival
in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> and whose image is still the post
office <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> in much of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.  The strangest survival
is dashboard : on an open carriage this is a small
vertical shield by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>'s feet, and like the fenders
over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wheels</ENAMEX>, it keeps mud from being dashed
up as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> go.

            When we say that luxurious little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> serve
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX> trade , we commemorate the coachmen
who waited in the cold while the very rich shopped,
for only the very rich could afford to come in carriages
of their own.  If the public wished to travel,
they could take stagecoaches, which employed an
extra <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> besides the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> called a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> , who was
armed to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> from bandits.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> survives figuratively on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX>, where
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> corresponds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductor</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trainman</ENAMEX> .  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> we retain the notion more colorfully
when we say someone is riding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun</ENAMEX> on a
project, acting as a troubleshooter.

            
               Coach in the artistic or sports sense is an abstraction
of the vehicle sense; for as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> explains,
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> was thought to convey his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> toward mastery.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Team</ENAMEX> , now also a sports
word, is rooted in tow , and originally referred to the
set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> used to draw a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>.  A four-horse
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX> is called a four-in-hand , and this has given its
name to a necktie knot (the narrow kind, not the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wide Windsor</ENAMEX> knot).  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who drives <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> is a
teamster , a word preserved in the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">truckers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>.

            Following a trend we hop on the bandwagon , the
gaudiest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon</ENAMEX> in a circus parade.  Giving up <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>,
we are simply on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon</ENAMEX> , the water wagon
that sprinkled down dusty dirt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> in summertime.
You can't do business from an empty <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon</ENAMEX> -- an
empty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peddler</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon</ENAMEX>--and if you heed the advice
of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ralph Emerson</ENAMEX>, you will hitch your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">wagon</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> .  Fixing someone's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon</ENAMEX> is teaching
them a lesson, and pipe up about grievances: the
squeaky wheel gets the grease , because a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon</ENAMEX>'s
hubs rotate directly on the axletrees and squeak if
they are not greased constantly.  Taking something
away, we cart it off; and scandals fester until the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumbrels</ENAMEX> roll, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">executioner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
Revolution.  The ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cart</ENAMEX>, the charette ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bedevils</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX>, who charette when they finish
drafting in a great hurry at the very last minute.  An
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> doing this is said to be on charette -- literally
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cart</ENAMEX>, as if everyone were stuffed in and frantically
working away till the very moment they clattered
up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX>'s door!

            
               Leaning into the collar is working hard: imagine
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> straining against the collar to pull a heavy
load.  The leather eye-patches sewn to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> of
the halter ( blinders in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and blinkers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>)
keep a horse from shying by narrowing vision
to the road directly ahead, the sense implied when
we say that someone does something with blinders
on or has a blinkered viewpoint.  In tandem is often
used to mean simultaneously or even side-by-side,
but a tandem hitch is actually one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> horses
ranged one in front of the other, in a single line, with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tandem</ENAMEX> originally going back to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> pun.  On the
other hand, a troika -- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> political powers working
together -- harks back to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> hitch of three
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses abreast</ENAMEX>.

            We coax balking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like reluctant draft animals
with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carrot</ENAMEX> and stick , get them back into harness
after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a holiday</TIMEX>, yoke them to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> like
oxen, drive them hard as part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Companies</ENAMEX>
even keep stables of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> or whatnot.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marrying</ENAMEX>, we get hitched , like harnessed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>; and we even try to harness wind and sun and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s enthusiasm.  We whip up enthusiasm too, as
a horseman whips up his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> to get them going.
And horsewhipping once settled many public arguments,
since whips were commonly carried on errands
so they would not be stolen from the parked
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">buggies</ENAMEX>.  An old catalogue from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wadsworth Atheneum</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Gallery</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hartford</ENAMEX> even read: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Umbrellas</ENAMEX>,
Parasols, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canes and Whips</ENAMEX> to be left at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of
the stairs.

            Of course, the buggy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whip</ENAMEX> is rare enough today
to be a byword for anything hopelessly outmoded --
the buggy-whip industry being singled out with a
particular chuckle -- and horse-and-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">buggy days</TIMEX> has
become the byword for a whole lost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>.

            The desultory dialogue recorded below is a verbatim
rendering of the sort of conversation one
might overhear on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurostar</ENAMEX> as it chunders towards
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>.  As well as their duty-free plus, the two
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> have a selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> vocabulary
to declare.  Many of these words and phrases
are here, even as we speak, but largely confined to
literary/academic circles.  With the advent of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Channel Tunnel</ENAMEX>, however, we may expect a Gallic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">idiom</ENAMEX> to enter common usage as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the century</TIMEX> itself
chunders towards <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> 2000...


<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scene - A Eurostar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ARTHUR</ENAMEX> sits next to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX>, who looks rough.

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>: Not quite the rendezvous with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Destiny</ENAMEX>
the brochure claims, perhaps, but still--where once
there was a watery impasse, now there's <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Anglo-French</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rapport</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurotunnel</ENAMEX>.  And very fin de
si√®cle it is, too.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> pulls out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Gare du Nord</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>: (sighing) I'm always sad to leave.  No
matter how prodigious your joie de vivre, partir
c'est <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mourir un peu</ENAMEX>, don't you think?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX>: (blinking) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pardon</ENAMEX>?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>: √áa ne fait rien.  One too many nuits
blanches, eh?  The spirit is always willing, but for
the flesh -- especially under the eyes -- they can be
something of a b√™te noire...I bet you'll miss the
grub, though.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX>: Only the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>.  Those baguettes are
real bargain-stretchers -- and you can use them as
b√¢tons on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√©tro</ENAMEX>, too.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>: But what about <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cordon bleu</ENAMEX>?  Didn't
you dine out while you were over?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burger King</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champs Elys√©es</ENAMEX>,
mostly.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>: I'm talking about haute <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX>, not les
bas fonds!  I think you're missing something.  I had
myself some amazing blowouts...I particularly
remember some p√¢t√© de foie gras I sampled.  It made
all the p√¢t√© de foie gras I'd tasted previously seem
mere pastiche.  It was a tour de force.  Shame the
wine -- a parvenu <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chardonnay</ENAMEX> -- proved to be a
weak link.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX>: I'm strictly a snacker at the best of
times -- I prefer vignettes to full-coursers.  I did try a
cr√™pe suzette once, but it tasted like paper.  I'd
rather spend money on a film than --

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ah</ENAMEX>, a film buff.  Tell me: when is a director
simply a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> and when an auteur?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, I'm just a filmgoer.  Call me
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pass√©</ENAMEX>, but if a movie has a decent plot and credible
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> I go home happy.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>: But after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godard</ENAMEX>'s riposte to the raconteur,
no rapprochement is possible between --

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX>: To be honest, a lot of the films recommended
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> make me feel more like a voyeur
than a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectator</ENAMEX> --

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>: Of course -- a contemporary film narrative
(if it can properly be called a narrative) puts
voyeurism under surveillance.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX>: I see... They're never short of a
nude or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, that's for sure, but for my money there
are too many longueurs.  But I'd sooner a film than
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art gallery</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any day</TIMEX>.  You never know what might
turn up as an objet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">d'art</ENAMEX>, do you?  ...Or maybe
you do.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>: If you mean that succ√®s de scandale
where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> showcased a border-control barrier
with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cupid</ENAMEX>'s arrow and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naomi Campbell</ENAMEX> 4 The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Elephant Man</ENAMEX> scrawled on it --

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX>: No, it's just that I find all those objets
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trouv√©s</ENAMEX> so recherch√©s.  The attitude behind them --
√ßa me fait chien.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>: Are you au fait with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Koons</ENAMEX>?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX>: Koons?  The name rings a bell...
Yes, I'm nearly sure somebody answering to that
name tried to flog me a vacuum cleaner once.  I remember
because the price he was asking was so
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">outr√©.</ENAMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>: Funny you should say that because
there are those who consider him a traveling salesman
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manqu√©.</ENAMEX>  But for others he's vital link with a
tradition of impertinence dating back to dada in general
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duchamp</ENAMEX>'s urinal in particular.  Like yourself,
I have reservations about objets trouv√©s: I
don't think they become aesthetic simply because
they cease to be functional.  For me, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koons</ENAMEX> is the
latest manifestation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">je m'en foutisme</ENAMEX>.  In short, so
much blague.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duchamp</ENAMEX>'s urinal was a pis aller after
which there should have been silence, broken only
by the occasional gurgle from the cistern.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX>: I'm partial to water-colors myself and
a bit dubious about anything since the Impressionists,
who might justifiably have prophesied, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apr√</ENAMEX>©s
nous, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">le</ENAMEX> d√©luge...

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>: I share your wariness, to a point.  Too
many modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> have a penchant for leaning
over backwards to tease <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>, but forget all about
I'homme moyen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sensuel</ENAMEX> who, more often than not,
likes his pictures in comics.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bien s√ªr</ENAMEX>.  Where are the punchlines in
painting?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>: Well, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX>'s work combines austere
geometry with ebullient jocularity: even his most
tormented images can seem like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jeux d'esprit</ENAMEX>.  Contours
are broken and illogical simultaneous viewpoints
gleefully entertained.  But see the way he negotiates
the cr√©vasses and avalanches of the image's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fragmentation</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">quel √©clat</ENAMEX>!  His was a brush with
lawlessness on its side; a brush as sure-footed as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamois</ENAMEX>--

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX>: But a bit of a bounder in his private
life, by all accounts.  <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Revenons √† nos moutons</ENAMEX>, however
--

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>: Revenons √† nos moutons, if it's
punchlines you're after, look no further than that
quiff on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Femme dans le</ENAMEX> jardin or the
sculptures in --

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX>: Maybe au fond I'm just a philistine,
but I can never quite convince myself that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>
obsessed with the naked human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">form</ENAMEX> aren't pornographers,
by any other nom de plume.  I know loose
morals are de rigeur for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">la vie de Boh√®me</ENAMEX>, but --

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pornography</ENAMEX> may be risqu√©, but it
takes no chances, aesthetically speaking.  It's a question
of style --

            He raises a hand to quell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX>'S protests.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>: I know -- but what is style?  Bon ton?
Flair?  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panache</ENAMEX>?  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aplomb</ENAMEX>?  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verve</ENAMEX>?  Chic?  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">√âlan</ENAMEX>?  The
trouble with all those terms is they associate style
with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">√©l√©gance</ENAMEX> and ignore its jolie-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">laide</NUMEX> dimension.
Any discussion of what constitutes style must encompass
tributaries as diverse as the lavatory humor
found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gargantua & Pantagruel</ENAMEX> and the exquisite
diction presiding over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belinda</ENAMEX>'s toilette in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Rape</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lock</ENAMEX> .  √Ä propos of this diversity of styles, it
might be remarked that diversifiers have often been
discriminated against by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>, who would have
would-be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> specialize; they throw a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cordon</ENAMEX> sanitaire around respective artistic endeavors
with a rapidity and thoroughness that is most
unhealthy.  Any genre-hopping is strongly discouraged.
And if these pogo-stickers are acknowledged
at all, it's their fate to be f√™ted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> medium and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disparaged</ENAMEX> in others, although they may (like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyndham</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX>, say) have been accomplished in more
than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.  In this way, first-rate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peripatetic artists</ENAMEX>
are consigned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pantheon</ENAMEX>'s banlieux rather than
its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7th</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arrondissement</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX>: I wouldn't know about that, but I
think the work should speak for itself.  Any critiques
are de trop.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>: Certainly the work should speak for itself,
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">√ß a va sans dire</ENAMEX>.  Despite the plethora of synonyms
for it, style continues to elude definitions with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finesse</ENAMEX>.  It's maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-fifths savoir-faire douched
with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fifths je ne sais quoi--if that's the mot
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">juste</ENAMEX>.  I'd say, le style, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c'est l'homme</ENAMEX>, but look at
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Cantona</ENAMEX> --

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX>: What, you mean the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manchester</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> ace given to contretemps with footballing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>
and fits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallic</ENAMEX> pique?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>: I was thinking more of the Rimbaud
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> whose arabesques cause defenses to wobble
like blancmanges.  How can we reconcile the boorish
drop-kick aimed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crystal Palace</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> in the
stands with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric</ENAMEX>'s suave skills on the pitch?  He's
been banned till <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> so the rest of the season
will be a real saison en enfer for him -- he'll have
plenty of time to write a dissertation on everybody's
favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">po√®te maudit</ENAMEX>.  For me, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rimbaud</ENAMEX> never graduated
from being an enfant terrible to become a major
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>; he only compounded the clich√© inaugurated
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Villon</ENAMEX>, that is, combining absinthe-fueled
dissipation on slender means with a vacillating devotion
to his art.  He wound up trading it in for gunrunning
and died of a gangrenous tumor, but chacun
√† <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> go√ªt, as one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">amputee</ENAMEX> said to another.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>'s monologues are taking effect; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX>
feels quite drained.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX>: I think I'll nip out to the buffet-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>--

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>: I'd approach the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">onion soup</ENAMEX>
with a soup√ßon of distrust, if I were you.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX>: Thanks for the warning.  It was nice
listening to you...<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adieu</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTHUR</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pas du</ENAMEX> tout -- we must do it again
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sometime</TIMEX>.

            But next time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIMOTHY</ENAMEX> resolves to fly.  OK, so
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a good day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chunnel</ENAMEX> is faster than flying on a
bad day, but the monologues on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Libert√</ENAMEX>© are
shorter.
         
         
            No <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Boys Named Sue</ENAMEX>, But...




            The most popular name in my (all-female) class
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ann/Anne</ENAMEX>.  There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> or
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of them.  Also <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Susans</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suzanne</ENAMEX>.  To
even think of using any of the variations for a boy
would have raised both a laugh and an eyebrow.
Which is the whole point of the song A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boy Named</ENAMEX>
Sue.

            Yet some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> before there was a boy
named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX> : the full-bearded face of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anne de</ENAMEX>
Montmorency <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1493-1567</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX>, courtier, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constable</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, gazes from his portrait with supreme
aristocratic confidence.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> of a powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> of wars, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> (legitimate)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sons</ENAMEX>, he was also, reproves the Encyclopaedia
Britannica , irascible and a ruthless authoritarian.
It deplores his scorched earth policy and
ruthless crushing of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> rebellion.  Just the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ungentle</NUMEX> times in which he lived?  Or something to
do with his name?  Did he, like the mythical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boy</ENAMEX>
Named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sue</ENAMEX>, continually have to prove himself?
His godmother was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duchesse of Brittany</ENAMEX> and
Queen of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</NUMEX>).  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX>, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hannah God</ENAMEX>-favored and reputedly the name of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blessed Virgin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother</ENAMEX>, has always been popular
with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">royalty</ENAMEX>.  The derivative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy</ENAMEX> , although
used for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> at least since the time of Queen
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">d. 1714</ENAMEX>), is not found for catamite until (says
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Partridge</ENAMEX>) about 1810.  It therefore seems unlikely
to be in any way connected with the excessively macho
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constable</ENAMEX>.

            We had no female <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaels</ENAMEX> nor even a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michal</ENAMEX> ,
although they were not unknown.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Barrymore</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">long-suffering wife</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Strange</ENAMEX>.  Miss
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Learned</ENAMEX> delighted TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> in The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waltons</ENAMEX> .  Did she have to battle with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in
the early stages of her career?

            
               Also high in the female popularity stakes in
1940s' <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shirley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alison</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shirley</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> reigned supreme and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte Bronte</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heroine</ENAMEX> gave intellectual respectability.  Originally a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yorkshire</ENAMEX> place and surname, it had mainly masculine
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alison</ENAMEX> , the Gaelic
form of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alice</ENAMEX> , actually means  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alice</ENAMEX>.  The only
other Gaelic name widely acceptable to the middle
classes that I remember was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deirdre</ENAMEX>.  Fiona lay in
the future, together with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sinead</ENAMEX> , and a host
of others, all unequivocally female.

            In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> red-headed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carol</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noel</ENAMEX> (not <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Carol e</ENAMEX>  or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Noel le</ENAMEX> ).  Were they the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergyman</ENAMEX> who surely admired neither
Carole the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cad</ENAMEX> one-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Romania</ENAMEX>,
nor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">No√´l Coward</ENAMEX>; but perhaps yearned for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX>?

            There was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vivien</ENAMEX> who could be comforted by
sharing her confusing name with a major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vivien</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX>.  Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> carried the fanciful variant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vyvian</ENAMEX> .

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leslies</ENAMEX> were more fortunate, for their sex
was distinguished by the spelling.  This was before
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphrey Bogart</ENAMEX> muddied the waters by calling his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">daughter Lesley</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesley Howard</ENAMEX>.  It has been
suggested to me that this name has lost a great deal
of its popularity for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> due to its diminutive, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les</ENAMEX> ,
too easily confused with lez (for lesbian ), which
seems a pity.  It has a pleasing sound once used by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burns</ENAMEX> with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonnie Lesley</ENAMEX> , and its
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> form is immortalized by the delightful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leslie</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caron</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">character Ashley in Gone With The</ENAMEX>
Wind is now unisex.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> it was recorded as the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> most common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'s name in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>.  Indeed,
in the less tradition-bound atmosphere of the New
World, dual-purpose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellys, Caseys, Beverleys</ENAMEX>,
Madisons , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dales</ENAMEX> abound.

            It seems that just as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> spelling in general
became more formalized with the spread of literacy,
so the gendering of names also became more defined.
For example, I have an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> ancestress
shown in contemporary records as both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christina</ENAMEX> -- never, until an inaccurate
1920s' copy of the family tree, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christine</ENAMEX> .

            The use of surnames as given names is worthy of
note.  The patronymics of powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cecil</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Percy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tudor</ENAMEX> ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stuart</ENAMEX> are all seen as masculine.  Yet Cecil
was initially a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'s name.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spenser</ENAMEX>'s (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">d.1599</ENAMEX>) most poignant elegies commemorates
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Howard Georges</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthur</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georges</ENAMEX>.  Similarly, the mystic, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady Julian</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norwich</ENAMEX>
(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1342</NUMEX>-post <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1416</TIMEX>) took her masculine name
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chapel of St. Julian</ENAMEX> where she had her
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hermitage</ENAMEX>.  (Surely not from the apostate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>?)
It is true that from the earliest times she was also
known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juliana</ENAMEX> , and all variants of this great <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clan</ENAMEX> name have always been popular, from a
former Queen of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> to the delicious
Julienne <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX>, named after a female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX>.  The apparently
straightforward transference of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX> names
can, however, lead to confusion.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> practice
of bestowing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">maternal grandparent</ENAMEX>'s surname
upon a first-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, gives us <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce Carey</ENAMEX> (the male
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">writer</ENAMEX>).  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce Carey</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX>) more likely got
her name from an adaptation of joyeuse .  Much the
same thing occurs with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucy</ENAMEX> (often Latinized to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucius</ENAMEX> ),
another surname, but when used for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> more
likely to be from the popular saint, or for its meaning,
light.

            This ambiguity could have extended to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX> ,
coming either from the flower or from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teutonic</ENAMEX>
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>.  Yet the only male Rose I can discover is
the nickname of the unlovely villain, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose Noble</ENAMEX> , in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dornford Yates</ENAMEX>'s 1930s' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">thriller Blind Corner</ENAMEX> .  Perhaps
there is a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Boy Called Rose somewhere in the</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>?  There was after all, that male <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carmen Cavallero</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hollywood Bowl Orchestra</ENAMEX>,
whose unusual name never failed to intrigue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
television interviewers.  His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> as a transatlantic
purveyor of popular classical music was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andr√</ENAMEX>©
Previn, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> first name is also occasionally
used for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>, without a qualifying extra e .

            Still in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> is (according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Babies</ENAMEX>' Names ) predominately female,
though an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> authority queries this.
Whether it originates with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> Sidonie or the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Viscount Sydney</ENAMEX> who gave his name to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> capital, is problematical.  Certainly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitford</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was so called, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sid</ENAMEX> was even a generic term for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>.  From the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of the heroic Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">d. 1586) Sydney</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">d. 1586</ENAMEX>), this has been a popular name, transcending
class barriers: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney Carton</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comic actor</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sid James; Sid</ENAMEX> of the huge government advertising
campaign when privatizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Gas</ENAMEX>.

            Privileged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are not a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> prerogative:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Cabot</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lodge</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winthrop</ENAMEX> appear
to have been largely used for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> is generously
even-handed: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Cobb; Harvey Oswald</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Remick</ENAMEX>;
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radziwill</ENAMEX>.  Transported by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf Stream</ENAMEX>,
it has even landed on my eldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX>.  Whether
this widely popular use has anything to do with any
close association with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert E.</ENAMEX>, the distinguished
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virginian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, or even the foundress of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shakers</ENAMEX>, is perhaps unlikely; it is just a very nice
name.

            Most names seem to drift from male to female
(perhaps reflecting a deeper trend).  Not so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evelyn</ENAMEX> .
In the form <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aveline</ENAMEX> , it was introduced by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normans</ENAMEX>.  Female until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>, it became
a surname and was then widely, but not exclusively
used for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>, generally of the upper or professional
classes: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evelyn Baring</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evelyn Henderson</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> of a 1930s' <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX>, and,
most famously, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evelyn Waugh</ENAMEX>.  His <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, together
with the mystic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evelyn Underhill</ENAMEX>, kept up the
female usage.  A slightly differing pronunciation
sometimes distinguishes the gender.  At about the
same time that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Aveline/Evelyn</ENAMEX> crossed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Channel</ENAMEX>,
it became acceptable to christen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> .  Previously
thought too holy for mortal use, once established,
there was no stopping it: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marie; Mairi; Mair</ENAMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ria; Marise</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moira</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marietta</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marion</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marian</ENAMEX> ).
Nor, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, was it confined to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Maria</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Weber</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Maria Remarque</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Marion</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crawford</ENAMEX>.  And, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">See Here Private</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marion</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hargrove</ENAMEX>.

            Once across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>, however, doubts set in.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Constable Anne Montmorency</ENAMEX> bestrode
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> history without apparent difficulty, but it was
feared that no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marion</ENAMEX> could ride tall in the saddle
however rugged his appearance.  So the studio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX>
repackaged their discovery, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marion Wayne</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>.
Could he, by the remotest chance, have been the inspiration
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A Boy</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sue</ENAMEX>?
         
         
            Proper <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Words in Proper Places</ENAMEX>




            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin</ENAMEX> is a language as dead as dead can be.
               It killed the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romans</ENAMEX> -- and now it's killing
me.
            

            I daresay there is truth in the rhyme we chanted
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> with such feeling.  In our language, dead
words are continuously discarded.  There is considerable
replacement, mostly of high technology words
and changes of meaning.  As new processes are discovered,
there must be a vocabulary to match.

            Some of these dead words are delightful.  Here
are a selection of measurements used when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>
was totally agricultural:


broad and narrow oxgang the amount of land
that could be cultivated by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ox</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between eight</NUMEX>
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> acres

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fardel</ENAMEX> (farthingdeal) <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1/4 acre</NUMEX>

landyard <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somerset</ENAMEX> measure for a rod

math the amount of crop mowed

nook corner of a square, small triangular field

quarentena a furlong

            

            A furlong was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an eighth</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mile and a rod four</NUMEX> and
a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">half yards</NUMEX> in pre-metric times when I started
school.

            The ancient field names are bizarre:


assart land converted into arable

bawn <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> dialect for fortified or cattle enclosure

booly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX>: temporary enclosure where itinerant
herdsmen keep their animals

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cockshoot/cockshut</ENAMEX> clearing through a wood

pightel small enclosed plot

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pingle Midlands</ENAMEX>: paddock

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spong Midlands</ENAMEX>: narrow strip of land

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wong</ENAMEX> a portion of unenclosed land

            

            Even nowadays one comes across dialect words
whose meaning is obscure.  On coming to live in
Gloucestershire, I was puzzled by tump, daps , and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shrammed</ENAMEX> (hillock, gym shoes, and cold) just as,
no doubt, many visiting the north are confused by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">skinch</ENAMEX> and clarty.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clarty</ENAMEX> is such a suitable word to
describe sticky with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mud</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skinch</ENAMEX> is used in childhood
games to call a truce, usually with crossed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fingers</ENAMEX>.

            There was a huge vocabulary, now dead, concerning
ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>.  Borstal was a hill path,
chare an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alley</ENAMEX>, chimin a legal term for a road
(<French chemin=?), and=leet was=a crossroads.</txt>=<txt>
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Years ago</TIMEX>, while on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parochial Church Council</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of a cottage adjacent to the churchyard,
had problems with the church wall bulging
onto her path.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humorless secretary</ENAMEX> entered this
event <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">in the minutes</TIMEX> as The bulging of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miss</ENAMEX> B's
back passage.  If only he'd had the correct word,
this uncomfortable event could have been referred
to as a tewer , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Midlands</ENAMEX> term for alleyway.

            Coins and taxes had their own vocabulary too.
An angel was a coin worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6/8</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">34p</NUMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1464</TIMEX>.  A
dandiprat was a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> coin worth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1¬Ωp</TIMEX>, and
a testoon was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5p</TIMEX>.

            
               Pavage, pontage, avenage, beaconage , and furnage
were taxes or tolls for, respectively, paved
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>, rent in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oats</ENAMEX>, upkeep of beacons, and
the use of the lord's oven.  Childwite was the fine
paid by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of a bastard.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> have always been free with their use
of nicknames, which, being descriptive, are useful to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX>.  As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> grew, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian</ENAMEX> names
became insufficient for identification purposes.  A
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">man</ENAMEX>'s trade became incorporated -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> blacksmith,
Cooper barrel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gardener</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farmer</ENAMEX> ,
and the less obvious, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">keeper</ENAMEX> of the pound,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hayward</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> responsible for the
care of game and of fences.  Place names often have
developed in the same way.  It is not difficult to see
how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sevenoaks, Newcastle</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coldharbour</ENAMEX> developed.

            Sometimes spelling changes obscure the meaning.
Deptford started life as a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Depe</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>
(across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">River Ravensbourne</ENAMEX>).  <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hounds Ditch</ENAMEX> is
supposed to have been a great <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pit</ENAMEX> where hunting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>, kenneled in the area, were thrown when dead.
Smithfield was originally Smethe smooth field , flat
enough for local fairs and markets.

            Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>, meanings change.  Generations
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> must have puzzled over Without a city
wall, from the hymn,


There is a green hill far away,
Without a city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>...

[<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.F. Alexander</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1818-95</TIMEX>]

            

            As used here, the meaning of without outside is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">archaic</ENAMEX>, as in the well-known stage line, The carriage
awaits without.

            It is difficult to believe that treacle was once a
wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>, that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cheater</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rent collector</ENAMEX> (more
credible), and that a publican was a public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servant</ENAMEX>.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Publicans</ENAMEX> and sinners were not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who kept
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pubs</ENAMEX>).  A gossip was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> at a baptism.

            Recent word changes are snuff an illegal film
and gay .  I, for one, mourn the unhappy mutilation
of meaning.  In my youth, one said <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Goodbye God be</ENAMEX>
with you on parting.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nowadays</ENAMEX>, we just say <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cheers</ENAMEX> ,
an all-purpose word used indiscriminately.
         
         
            All in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family</ENAMEX>



            When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Trust</ENAMEX> brought out a Country
Craftsmen Happy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Families children</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">card</ENAMEX> game <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years ago</TIMEX>, the names, such as Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reed</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>, were neatly matched to the occupations.
This has been the tradition since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1851</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Jaques</ENAMEX> of Hatton
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, commissioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Tenniel</ENAMEX>, the
Punch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cartoonist</ENAMEX> and future illustrator of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Carroll</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice</ENAMEX> books, to design the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> each in their highly successful and
long-lived juvenile pastime.  The main change by
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> has been that while the original family
names had a clear alliternative link with those of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jobs</ENAMEX>, this has not always been observed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> versions.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jaques</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were nearly all tradespeople,
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-Victorian</TIMEX> terms, and even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> was
given the title Mr. to fit the format.  The names
were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Block</ENAMEX> (barber); <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bones</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butcher</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bun</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baker</ENAMEX>);
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bung</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">brewer</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chip</ENAMEX> (carpenter); <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dip</ENAMEX> (dyer); <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dose</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grits</ENAMEX> (grocer); <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Potts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tape</ENAMEX> (tailor);
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soot</ENAMEX> (sweep).  A twelfth <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-card <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, drawn by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Carroll</ENAMEX>'s niece <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irene Dodgson</ENAMEX>, who married
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Jaques III</ENAMEX>, was included in the game during
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWI</ENAMEX> and lasted till just after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>.  This was Mr.
Mug the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milkman</ENAMEX>, depicted with slopping-over pail
and hand-bell, who maintained the alliterative pattern.
A majority of the names still work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>,
though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Block</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chip</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dip</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grits</ENAMEX> might well be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">opaque</ENAMEX> to modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> or taken in a different
sense without the accompanying illustration.  Perhaps,
too, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bung</ENAMEX> would be a football <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> in
recent times.

            In the versions that abandoned the alliterative
connection, it was possibly easier to give a satirical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slant</ENAMEX> to the names, as with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sand the Grocer</ENAMEX>,
probably alluding to the same suspicions of adulteration
in the trade voiced in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.K. Chesterton</ENAMEX>'s verses,
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Song Against Grocers:</ENAMEX>


He sells us sands of Araby
As <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>, for cash down...

            

            The format was taken up for advertising purposes,
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and personified cigarette
brands and was given an ingenious verbal twist
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> in a large Happy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Families set</ENAMEX> produced
by the drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wyeth</ENAMEX> to publicize a cough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linctus</ENAMEX>.
All the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> had names related to types of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cough</ENAMEX>.
There was thus the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bark</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeders</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hack</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of woodcutters, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoarse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jockeys</ENAMEX>, and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">knife</ENAMEX>-grinding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rasps</ENAMEX> .

            Exposure to Happy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Families</ENAMEX> at an early age perhaps
leaves us ever afterwards sensitized to apt
matches -- or mismatches -- of name and profession,
which may be why they seem so easy to spot.  Among
the many treasured examples that have come my way
are Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scales</ENAMEX> , a deep-sea fisherman, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Main</ENAMEX> , a
plumber, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bridge</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hewitt</ENAMEX> , a forester,
and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Down</ENAMEX> , a demolition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX>, who
even manages to alliterate.  But a name may also connect
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bearer</ENAMEX>'s work in a less fortunate way.  A
glance through the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">occupational group</ENAMEX> in my
local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yellow Pages</ENAMEX> turns up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> with suitably
evocative names like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bull</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sheaves</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steer</ENAMEX> ,
but others called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Blight and Greed</ENAMEX> .  No doubt Farmer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blight</ENAMEX> can stand it, and has got used to the jokes produced
by a not altogether happy conjunction of name
and business.  He may be taking some pleasure in the
possible recent discomfiture of the previously appropriately
named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farmer Veale</ENAMEX> , in the wake of the campaign
against live calf exports from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>.
Similar thickness of skin may be required by a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountant</ENAMEX>, who is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Crook</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Blood and Coffin</ENAMEX> .

            So familiar is the phenomenon that it was capitalized
on in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1980s</TIMEX> by the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dartmouth</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Devon</ENAMEX> to raise money for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>'s
swimming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pool</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> separate sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Happy Families</ENAMEX>
cards were published using authentic local business
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s names of both the congruent and clashing
kinds, such as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drew</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Artist</ENAMEX>, who helped with
the production, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pillar the Builder</ENAMEX>, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Killer</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chemist</ENAMEX>.

            Despite the total symmetry of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> actually
called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farmer</ENAMEX> , most names which either historically
relate to a trade or merely suggest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to us through
some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> are carried by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in completely
different occupations.  In this way Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shepherd</ENAMEX>
may be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jeweler</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glover</ENAMEX> a carpenter,
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bridle</ENAMEX> a joiner and not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">harness-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX>, and
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fudge</ENAMEX> an estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> rather than a confectioner
or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX>.  There are several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bakers</ENAMEX> who are
butchers by calling and may even draw attention to
it with advertisements highlighting Bakers the
Butchers , though I have yet to record a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Butcher</ENAMEX> trading
as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baker</ENAMEX>.  I shall continue to look out as well for
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> who actually works as one.
         
         
            On <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Terms</ENAMEX>




            The shift away from agricultural life progresses
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apace</ENAMEX>.  With this shift also fades the rural idiom
that accompanied it.  All the more reason, then, to
focus on this idiom as seen in colorful terms before it
drops below the horizon.

            Near the highest elevation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode Island</ENAMEX> in
the woods stands a heap of rocks, a marker, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about six</TIMEX>
feet high surmounted by a flat, upright slab adding
another <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two feet</NUMEX> to its height.  Such a marker goes
by the name merestone (also meerestone or mear-stone) .
According to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the OED2e</TIMEX> that term harks
back to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saxon</ENAMEX> text dating from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">956</NUMEX> AD .  A millennium
later when I asked a nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> about the
land marker, although he had not seen it, he without
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hesitation</ENAMEX> called it a merestone .  Few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">others</ENAMEX> knew
that term, although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Holdsworth</ENAMEX> added that it
turns up in old deeds.  For me it served as a milestone
prompting me to collect rare words.

            What would you call a low, narrow strip of land,
for instance, a flat stretch running between a hillside
and a brook?  Answer: a slang.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s Third calls
it dialectal.  OED2e offers a quotation dating from
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1610</TIMEX>: There runneth forth into the sea a certaine
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shelfe</ENAMEX> or slang, like unto an out-thrust tongue.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Auchincloss</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwelling</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hammersmith</ENAMEX>
Farm at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newport</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">R.I.</ENAMEX>, originated on the drawing
boards of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.H. Robertson</ENAMEX>, and landscape
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Law Olmsted</ENAMEX>.  The plan as executed
included a barrier, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ha-ha</NUMEX> , to prevent livestock
from straying too close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwelling</ENAMEX>.  Though now
in disuse, it consists of a trench <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three feet</NUMEX> deep, on
sloping land, with a retaining wall on the uphill side.
This <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ha-ha</NUMEX> was constructed so as to be completely
invisible to the occupants of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hammersmith</ENAMEX> Farm.
The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ha-ha</NUMEX> is probably encountered more often now
in crossword puzzles than in the landscape.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> likely dictionaries omit the word tug as it is
used locally.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Block Islander Ellsworth Lathan</ENAMEX> assured
me that his fellow<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-islanders</ENAMEX> refer to peat, once
widely used for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>, as tug .  To them winning peat
consists of digging tug from bogs and hauling it out
to dry before burning.  Who knows, perhaps the arduous
haul gave rise to the term tug?  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peat</ENAMEX> bogs,
where tug lies waiting, occur in the lowest land
around.  Hence it comes as no surprise to find in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Exeter</ENAMEX> a lowland called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tug Hollow</ENAMEX> .  In such
places, too, is found bog iron , sometimes concentrated
enough to deflect compasses.  Bog iron has
found its way into the dictionary (viz. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> ), and
so, too, should tug .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rhode Islanders</ENAMEX> have been ridiculed for their
eccentric pronunciation, leaving rs out of words or
adding them at random.  Witness the bumper-sticker
that reads, In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode Island Drunk Drivers</ENAMEX> get
Court.  Or the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> who quoted the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>
phrase the law of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> in such a way that it
came out the lore of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawd</ENAMEX>.  Something like
that happened when a tried-and-true <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swamp Yankee</ENAMEX>
pointed to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> with an abnormally wide-flaring
bole, saying, It's a churn-buttered <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak</ENAMEX>.  That
needed unscrambling.  Churn because like a butter
churn the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> flares widely at its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>.  Since churns
are associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX>, the word butted , which is
what he meant to say, became converted into buttered .
As a term, churn-butted has identical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>,
swell-butted and the more graphic bell-butted .

            While considering boles, butts and churns, let's
take the word haggle .  Of course, you may say, it
means to argue over a price, hopefully to whittle it
down to size.  That is literally what my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon</ENAMEX>
Peckham, meant when he spoke of haggling a stick
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> .  And that is exactly how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Century Dictionary</ENAMEX>
defines it: variant form of heckle to hack;
to cut or chop.  Further, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">OED2e</TIMEX> supports this with
its definition, to make cuts, hack.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon</ENAMEX> was right.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> had a sawmill where he frequently
spoke of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dozy wood</ENAMEX>, a term seldom used on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Square</ENAMEX>.  As the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">OED2e</NUMEX> delicately puts it, of timber
or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> in a state of incipient decay.  Akin to dozy is
the term wany (or waney ), used to describe a board
as cut at the sawmill, imperfect because it ran into
bark of the log from which it was cut.

            Once again from the sawmill or more correctly
the planing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mill</ENAMEX>, the term pickwick in the following
sense has nothing to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX>.  When knotty
pine panels are installed, their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> nailed side
by side form quirky joints.  These may be simple
V-shaped grooves or more fancy ones such as a molding
with an ogee curve.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> was equipped
with a pickwick , a sharp distinctive cutting edge to
gouge out the desired groove, and the term came to
be applied to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> as well as the tool.  Pickwick
comes to us from the age of oil lamps: when the wick
burned down too low to give a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flame</ENAMEX>, it had to
be raised, often by use of a sharp-pointed instrument
designed expressly to do that, a pickwick .  Was a pickwick,
then, the prototype of the sharp-profiled attachment
on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>?

            After lumberjacks snaked the logs out of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">woods</ENAMEX>, one log behind another, linked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> and
horse-drawn, they set aside some logs to be hand-hewn.
Before hewing with the broad <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ax</ENAMEX>, they first
scored the logs at intervals to prevent deep, damaging
cuts.  This scoring process they called skaffing ,
and the marks so made, skaffs -- at least so my informants
tell me.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> , however, defines skaff as a
saw kerf, labeling the term colloquial <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX>.
Granted, saws leave kerf marks, uneven
ridges which are straight if they came from the old
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-and-down saws, circular if from the later circular
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saws</ENAMEX>.  But kerf marks on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milled timber</ENAMEX> are hardly the
same as skaffs on hewn logs.  Perhaps the term varied
from place to place and in different ages.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Hay poles</ENAMEX> as a term would never win a popularity
contest with computer terminology, but lest we
forget, they were poles used in pairs by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> out from with a pole in each hand, the other,
holding the opposite ends, bringing up the rear, and
carrying <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bales</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hay</ENAMEX> cut by scythe from the hummocks
of a bog.  Making the poles of light-weight
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poplar</ENAMEX> reduced the overall burden.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Horses</ENAMEX> were of
no use in swamp or swale, but hay poles did the
trick.

            On a dairy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX>, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> overworked the
same bull in breeding <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cows</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> would at
length become too inbred.  In such a case Willoughby
Young would observe, There's too much
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">snipper</ENAMEX> in the stock.  The nearest I could find to
that in a dictionary was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Century</ENAMEX> , which defines
a snipper-snapper as a small, insignificant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">OED2e</NUMEX> defines snipper as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> dealer
on a small scale.

            The term dandling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> means a seesaw.
This one came to me from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">countryman</ENAMEX> with a remarkable
name, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Resolved Waterman</ENAMEX>, who pronounced
his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> name with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> syllables.  Solvey,
as everyone called him, kept <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holstein</ENAMEX> oxen and Suffolk
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>.  Nothing unusual about that, except that
he trained them to perform on a dandling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">county</ENAMEX> fairs or before other awestruck <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX>.  It
seems doubtful that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disneyland</ENAMEX> would carry on this
tradition.

            Colorful names from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and animal kingdom
are rife.  A few examples follow: dipper duck
for the pied-billed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">grebe</TIMEX>; jakes for young male turkeys
(their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elders</ENAMEX> are toms); loopwood or witch
hobble for the hobblebush ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Viburnum alnifolium</NUMEX> )
because the stems bend over and grow roots at the
tips creating a loop that can abruptly trip a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hiker</ENAMEX> in
snowy woods; pippin , not for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apple</ENAMEX>, but for the
tangy, red berry of wintergreen (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Gaultheria procumbens</NUMEX>);
pugger for ferret; quong-queedle for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bobolink</ENAMEX>; rain <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crow</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cuckoo</ENAMEX>, often heard
before rain; scoke (or skoke ) for pokeweed ( Phytolacca
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">americana</ENAMEX> ) of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Massachusett Indian</ENAMEX> origin; skipper
for a young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>; and finally an imaginative
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, whippoorwill shoes for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>'s slipper orchid
(Cypripedium acaule) .

            In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baker</ENAMEX> before baking her
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> must make the dough gaumy, by which she
meant moist enough.  OED2e calls gaumy a rare
word and offers the alternate spelling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gormy</ENAMEX> .  One
wonders how gaumy the dough was that Thoreau
mentions when he tells us that his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> left a bowl
of dough overnight to rise, only to find the cate the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> comfortably enthroned on the dough.
We trust she rose to the occasion.

            If a forest fire ravaged the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> leaving them
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twigless</ENAMEX> and limbless, the above-mentioned Willoughby
Young would call them dead staddles.
Country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> understand this; city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do not.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are so numerous
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode Island</ENAMEX> that one of them commented, If
you lift up a stone in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hope Valley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyons</ENAMEX> will go
scuttering off in all directions.  Picturesque, and
the meaning is perfectly clear.

            Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Willoughby</ENAMEX>, who was my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mentor</ENAMEX> in matters
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> language, explained the term scythe
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rifle</ENAMEX>.  He had shown me his boiling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>, a spring
that boils up from the depths and also bubbles.  He
and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> used to collect the sand from a boiling
spring to make scythe <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX>.  This tool was used for
sharpening scythes on the hayfield in hot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>.  A
scythe <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifle</ENAMEX> consisted of a stick of wood flattened on
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> like a paint paddle, then smeared with Le
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Page</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glue</ENAMEX> and sprinkled liberally with the dried
sand from a boiling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>.  So said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willoughby</ENAMEX>.
Pleased with my new knowledge, I paraded if before
another old-timer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lester Brown</ENAMEX>, who caught
me up short.  That's the new way of doing it. quoth
he.  The old way was to take a flat stick, hickory was
good, and jab it with an ice pick <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of</NUMEX> times,
spread <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX> tallow over the pits, and finally sprinkle
boiling spring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> on and work it in.  That, he
concluded, would last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three years</TIMEX> on the hayfield.
Surprisingly even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Waldo Emerson Knew</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">scythe rifles</ENAMEX>.  In his essay on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX> he remarks,
...what is more lonesome than the sound
of a whetstone or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mower</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifle</ENAMEX> when it is too late in
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> to make <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hay</ENAMEX>.

            The words or terms included herein comprise a
mere cross-section, a sampler of the language of rural
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, these coming only from the smallest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who use them use a language far richer
than that of simple <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Basic English</ENAMEX>.  Old words fade
out.  New words take their place.  But isn't that the
difference between a dead and a living language?
         
         
            
Whenever there is something that is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> to
me, I peddle my butt up there,' [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taborsak</ENAMEX>] said, referring
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">senate chamber</ENAMEX>... [<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">From The News</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Danbury</ENAMEX>,

            A Discouraging Word




            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few months ago</TIMEX>, when I installed and turned
on my new computer, the name of the startup program
that appeared on the screen was not <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macintosh</ENAMEX>
HD, as the manual assured me it should be, but
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balagan</ENAMEX>.  Nowhere in the manual (and I searched repeatedly)
was this term cited.  More frustrating, Balagan
allowed me to proceed nowhere.

            New <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of newly bought software are especially
vulnerable when seeking help.  They are easily
persuaded that their inability to work with the computer
lies not with hardware, software, or any ware.
The fault, dear computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>, is not in our wares
but in ourselves, to coin an expression for computer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salespeople</ENAMEX>.  To get rid of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balagan</ENAMEX>, change the name,
I was told, to any name you want.  I might have replied
that that program by any other name would be
as sinister.  For a time, balagan was the most discouraging
word in my vocabulary.  Store <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> finally took
back the computer, grudgingly.  There <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks later</TIMEX>,
they gave it back, de-balaganized somehow.  They
wouldn't say.

            Was there in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>, I asked, a mischievous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX>, a Mr. or Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balagan</ENAMEX>, who playfully infected
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">machine</ENAMEX> with a computer virus (whatever
that is)?  Among the many I queried, merriment at my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discomfort</ENAMEX> was evident.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX>, I started a book, The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hope</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wouk</ENAMEX>.  Imagine my frisson when, after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a few</TIMEX>
pages into <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 1</ENAMEX>, I came upon this exchange between
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>:


What's happening?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Utter</ENAMEX> and complete balagan! That's what's happening
!

            

            The author helpfully dropped this footnote:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balagan</ENAMEX>.  In modern <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>, mess, foulup, snafu,
fiasco.  A loan word from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>, used in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> with extraordinary frequency.

            

            I congratulated myself.  I was evidently correct.
Balagan was planted in the computer to foul it up.
Having read enough fiction for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, I turned to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>.  In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arts and Leisure</ENAMEX> section,
I was drawn to a headline about the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX>.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX>, datelined <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, described a documentary
about the legacy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> called--
you guessed it-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balagan</ENAMEX>.  The film takes its title, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> said, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> word for chaos.

            Can <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> be far behind?  Announce the coming
so that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> can say I know, I know.

         
         
            You can have your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX> and eat it




            There is a notion favored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brussels</ENAMEX> that products should not be named after a
place or sound like some original thing such as champagne
or cheddar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> unless they come from that
place.  The obvious one is of course the humble <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brussels</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sprout</ENAMEX>, although I am unsure if this little green
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monster</ENAMEX> should have a capital to denote it's capital.  I
don't care for sprouts much, and don't buy enough of
them to worry about their correct form of address.

            This subject often arises in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pubs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>
where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> is served.  Food is the most obvious subject,
but the range of everyday things which might at
some time have to be renamed is extensive.  First,
there are obvious and widespread things like Eccles
cakes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lancashire</ENAMEX> hotpot, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornish</ENAMEX> pasty, and Welsh
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rarebit</ENAMEX>.  This is part of a much longer geographical
list of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foodstuffs</ENAMEX> which can be expanded to include
some sublime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> delight,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> toast, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tonic water</ENAMEX>, chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiger</ENAMEX> nuts, although the last might defy such easy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">categorization</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Bombay duck</ENAMEX> (which is some sort of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>) seems to be like a double fault, but just think of
all those dishes on the menus of your favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
Does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bombay</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alloo</ENAMEX> come from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bombay</ENAMEX>?  Is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Madras</ENAMEX> flown in specially <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX>?  Where is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vindaloo</ENAMEX>?
            

            Another (rather dubious) category is anatomy
with tennis elbow and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housemaid</ENAMEX>'s knee .  Then
there's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derbyshire</ENAMEX> neck, which is a complaint, not an
activity.  We also have bow legs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> noses, pigeon
chests, not to mention <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> measles, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken pox</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crow</ENAMEX>'s feet.
            

            One might want to include clothing with anatomy
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> the grounds of proximity.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> bags, like
flares, might <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> come back into fashion, while
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wellington</ENAMEX> boots obviously won't.  Arran sweaters are
both attractive and fashionable, but the idea of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guernsey Jersey</ENAMEX> is rather difficult to cope with.  Codpieces
are definitely out, which is a good thing since,
like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chelsea</ENAMEX> bun, they fall into a category called
could also be food.

            Sometimes, one encounters exotica.  The last
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venus</ENAMEX> flytrap I saw was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kew</ENAMEX>, and I've seen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>
bars in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Basingstoke</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canterbury</ENAMEX> bells are
nothing like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westminster</ENAMEX> chimes, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manchester</ENAMEX> tart is
different from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bakewell</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Forest</ENAMEX> gateau competes
with chocolate log.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swedish</ENAMEX> massage is performed
in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> candles, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> yoghurt,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Spanish fly</ENAMEX>, navel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX> --they will all have
to be changed.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mountain</ENAMEX> bike or a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hackney</ENAMEX> cab
could be used to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cumberland</ENAMEX> for a sausage,
passing through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barnsley</ENAMEX> for a chop with, of course,
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Yorkshire pudding</ENAMEX> .  Will we be able to have the same
meals riding in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Surrey</ENAMEX> ?  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> has a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> hat which he swears he wore in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX>.  He
wants to know if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX> sponge with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bath</ENAMEX> bun and
Malvern <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is of interest.  He is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> tonic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> with the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gin</ENAMEX>,
which explains the tortuous logic in his offering.  His
drink has, in fact prompted the lemon washing up
liquid category into which we should put oddities
like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiger</ENAMEX> balm, Manila envelope, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kiss</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
burn.
            

            Although we have clearly invented a new and
potentially dangerous way to look at the world
through the eye of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Brussels Can't Have This</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>, we can now design whole menus of the
forbidden food variety.  Breakfast could be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bacon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">muffin</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seville</ENAMEX> marmalade, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish</ENAMEX>
breakfast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elevenses</ENAMEX> might be a bit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dundee</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Granny Smith apple</ENAMEX>.  Lunch could be York
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ham</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Worcester</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> washed down with a nice
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drop of India Pale Ale</ENAMEX>.  In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX> you might
want to suck an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Everton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mint</ENAMEX> to tide you over until
dinner, which could include: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dover</ENAMEX> sole with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leek</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">puree</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> with the usual bits and pieces, including
the dreaded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brussels</ENAMEX> sprouts; Spotted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dick</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">custard</ENAMEX> and a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheeses</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish</ENAMEX>
cheddar, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somerset</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brie</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wensleydale</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wales</ENAMEX>, not forgetting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bath Olivers</ENAMEX>.  Of course,
you would have to drink something, and I suggest a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nice Suffolk Punch</ENAMEX> as an appetizer, followed by a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French Pilsener</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and a good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian</ENAMEX>
Shiraz with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX>, finishing with a spot of Kendal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mint</ENAMEX> cake .

            I don't want to provide any more bureaucratic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grapeshot</ENAMEX> (oops!) to restrict our freedom, but we
must remain alert when shopping for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>: that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX>
pastry sitting next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battenburg</ENAMEX> cake could
have been baked by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> wearing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argyll</ENAMEX> socks with
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windsor</ENAMEX> knot in his tie.  Stick to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farmhouse</ENAMEX> loaf
instead!

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> Sansculottery




            Writing styles have changed greatly from Victorian
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> when, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phyllis Cunnington</ENAMEX> observes
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costumes of the Nineteenth Century</ENAMEX>, to talk of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trousers</ENAMEX> was considered vulgar, and some extraordinary
names were given to them, such as unmentionables,
inexpressibles, unwhisperables, nether
integuments, and others.  But at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX>
this Victorian attitude persists, albeit with a new
twist: time and again men's trousers are not given
substitute names but are left out of otherwise quite
detailed sartorial descriptions.  Pants are, as it
were, repeatedly dropped.


...during the shooting of the movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.Q.</ENAMEX>,
...<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Matthau</ENAMEX>, who plays <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einstein</ENAMEX>, was
standing around in an auto-repair <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> (the set)
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hopewell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>.  With him were three
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> playing the parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einstein</ENAMEX>'s fictional
pals....  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matthau</ENAMEX> had on his <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einstein</ENAMEX> clothes
(floppy brown wide-wale corduroy pants, brown
suspenders, a gray striped <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX>-short-sleeved
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shirt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockport</ENAMEX> shoes) and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Einstein</ENAMEX> makeup
...<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saks</ENAMEX> was costumed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX> hat and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cream</ENAMEX>-colored jacket and pants; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jacobi</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">cap</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gloves</ENAMEX>, spats, and a too tight vest over a big belly:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maher</ENAMEX> in a white-and-black-checked coat, tweedy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pants</ENAMEX>, and round-rimmed glasses.

            Poor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jacobi</ENAMEX>'s pants were left off.  Is this why the
headline of the piece was They All Laughed?


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX> himself greeted me, dressed, as he almost
always is, in a sweater and bow tie.  He
showed no sign of being engaged in the struggle
of his career... [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ibid., October 31, 1994</TIMEX>]

            

            But the struggle seems to have turned physical.


[<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Graeve</ENAMEX>] goes to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Center</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>

When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Jones</ENAMEX> appeared on the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX>,
he was wearing what seemed to be a uniform--a

Whenever <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schultes</ENAMEX> was at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Botanical Museum</ENAMEX>,
he opted a striking costume: suspenders
(braces to him), a crimson four-in-hand, and a

In contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shigeru</ENAMEX>, who was wearing a

            In an interesting switch on pants-dropping, The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> has on occasion kept in pants but omitted
a key top garment.


They had sized each other up at the start,

            It is not clear whether this is an example of prudery
or of prurience, which has been exemplified by such
new-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> innovations as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s long excerpt
from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Story of O</ENAMEX> and a cover featuring a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">man</ENAMEX>'s crotch.

            
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> also often resorts to old-fashioned
stripping off of pants.  Even a cursory
reading of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">All the News That's Fit to Print</ENAMEX> turns
up examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> appearing bare-legged, not to
mention bare-bottomed.  From a description of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Carter</ENAMEX>'s meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radovan Karadzic</ENAMEX>:

stiletto heels.  [The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Magazine</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 29, 1995</TIMEX>]

            

            She was dressed not to the nines, but to the zeroes.

...wearing his trademark reading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfit</ENAMEX>: Converse
high tops, a formal shirt with black studs
and bow-tie, beneath a ratty old sport coat.  A
mess, but a considered one.

[ibid., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 6, 1992</TIMEX>]

            

            More of a mess than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> admitted.

            At least his TV attire was more complete than his offstage

            An article about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> known for its

Whenever I feel tempted to wear something

myself of the period in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 70</TIMEX>'s when
my bold party look was a black shirt and white

repainted white before every outing.

[<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurston Clarke</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 15, 1991</TIMEX>]

            

            Not too bold for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Men's Fashions of</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>.

         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serbian Front</ENAMEX>



            War inevitably brings with it vigorous surges
in language creativity, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from all
corners of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and from vastly different
walks of life are hurled together under extreme, often
bitter conditions.  In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX>, language
change in the nineties has been particularly
active as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX> has taken energetic measures to distance
itself from its <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Serbo-Croatian</ENAMEX> past.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> only
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyrillic</ENAMEX> alphabet may be used, and new language
edicts dictate which words are acceptable and which
are taboo.  Throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX>, old and young, front-liners
and mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers</ENAMEX>, find themselves regularly
overrun by new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> vocabularies and new
slang as the status quo of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> tilts and
changes.

            But the newest and most radical trends in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serbian</ENAMEX>
sweep through the fast-spoken slang of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX>'s
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX>--those who have
come of age since the breakup of the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX>.
We find, for instance, that the wild new
words for cool!, red!, and brilliant! are krvavo!
(bloody!), mrtvachki! (deadly!), bomba! (bomb!),
ludo! (crazy!), and grom! (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thunderclap</ENAMEX>!).  A hiphop
word for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> is supa za teturanye (staggering-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX>),
and the clandestine drug words of the
moment are:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mara</ENAMEX>, mariya, mariyana, maritsa, marish, marishka,
meri, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Meri-Jein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mary</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane</ENAMEX>) for marijuana

koks, koki, kokitsa, kokos, kochke, koka, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coca-cola</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>

hash, hasha, haki, haksli, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hale</ENAMEX>, hatsa, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shit</ENAMEX>, for hashish

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">horn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>, hop, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kon</ENAMEX>' (<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">doup</ENAMEX> (dope) for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX>

morfo, moka, moki, and mokitsa for morphene

            

            Sex is alliteratively called keks and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>-inter-course,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">playfully</ENAMEX>, kontsert concert, palachinka
pancake, and grupich grouping.

            But on a more sinister note, rough new bellicose
words have flooded into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> slang.  Quick rough
sexual intercourse, for instance, is called patrola, as
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">patrol</ENAMEX>.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rapist</ENAMEX> is called borats <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX>,
mehanichar mechanic, buldozer bulldozer, and,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">strangely</ENAMEX>, turist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourist</ENAMEX>.  A military raid is called
orkestar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestra</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of slang words for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">firearms</ENAMEX> have cropped up: the common revolver
alone is known as rovelo revats, reva, revar, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX>.
            

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the interesting phenomena in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serbian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slang</ENAMEX> is the rapid influx of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  Different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
ranging from urbane <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to cliques involved in
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> smuggling and prostitution, pepper their language
with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>-based expressions.  If
a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> were to rattle off lists of narcotics
words, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> would be surprised at all
the familiar sounds: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, sunshine, gelatina
(gelatin), and gel√© jelly, for instance, are cryptic
nicknames for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> in general.  The word for joint
is tvist twist. Spid speed, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">esid acid</ENAMEX>, amfi amphetamines,
dast dust, and met methedrine are
all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> names that have been directly imported
from the international drug scene.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Snifati</ENAMEX> to sniff
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> is a serbification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> sniff.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiks</ENAMEX> is a
fix, as in an injected dose, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sherbet</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serbian</ENAMEX>
insider word for the actual liquid that is injected.
Stereo means that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> is injecting in
both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> at the same time.  Drug rushes are called
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flesh</ENAMEX>, as in a flash, or simply trip, and to have a
super-strong drug-high with visions and hallucinations
is known as imati film to have a film.

            
               Autsaid outside signifies that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> is
out of it, totally stoned; <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">paranoia</ENAMEX> is the word
for bad trip.

            The trick of storing a narcotic in a condom and
hiding it in one's anal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> is called finger, and the
individual who transports <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> in this way is called
a transformator.
            

            In sex-trade circles, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> has made even
stronger inroads.  Penises are called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX>, fuckalo,
priki prickie, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joni Johnny</ENAMEX>, karakter character,
and tvrd karakter hard character, while vaginas
have anglicized names like rozbif roast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX>,
banka <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">fuck-itsa</ENAMEX>, and tunel.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prostitutes</ENAMEX> are
playfully known as gerla <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>-a, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-gerla</ENAMEX>, spermatorka,
spermara, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm-usha</ENAMEX>, stewardess, and, because
they walk the pavements, granit.  Another
trend is to give them <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>-sounding names, such
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ophelia</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura</ENAMEX>.  The unkindest word
on the scene is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volksvagina</ENAMEX>, a pun on the German
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagen</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prostitutes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> sex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> argue,
can be thought of as vaginas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX>.

            Scene words for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual hustlers</ENAMEX> display
even more anglicisms.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> working in drag
are often given the names <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margot</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fifi</ENAMEX>, or
princessa <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">princess</ENAMEX>.  Other words are used more
specifically to indicate the nature of an individual's
sexual tendencies: the passive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual</ENAMEX> is known
as pasivats or pelican (because of his funny walk)
while active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX> are called aktivist, activats,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">draifer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>.  In the wake of ecclesiastic scandals
involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> and their young charges, older
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX> who prefer sex with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> are
known as pater.  Bisexuals are called amphibia.
            

            Other more general slang words for homosexual
are variations on homo: homos, homosapiens, homic,
homin, and the vicious homokenyats <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homo-ass</ENAMEX>, or
variations on sissy: sisi and sisikur.  But the largest
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of gay taunts can be classified as the ped-
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>, all words inspired by pederasty: pederaj,
pederash, pederishka, pederin, pederko, pedal, pedalo,
petsa, pechurka, pepos, pedos, pepi, pedikir (a
pun on pedicure ), peder, and its facetiously <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-sounding
inversions derp√© and depr√©.
            

            The strangest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> slang word for homosexual
is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shekspir Shakespeare</ENAMEX>.
            The orthography used here for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> slang-words is
not a standardized transliteration of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serbian Cyrillics</ENAMEX>, and
not an official <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> spelling--which would be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Croatian</ENAMEX>, and
therefore taboo.  My aim was to capture the sound of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serbian</ENAMEX>
slang for the English-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>.
         
         
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare Thesaurus</ENAMEX>
            For a large part of the world--and not only the
English-speaking world--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> remains the
inexhaustible source of inspiration for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">directors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX>, learned societies,
linguists, drama <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> (where, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, he
is honored more in the breach than the observance),
films, academia, literary criticism, bibliographers,
translators, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX>, pilgrims, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosophers</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX>.

            An impressive and thoroughly engaging addition
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> scholarship, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spevack</ENAMEX>'s A <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare Thesaurus</ENAMEX> deserves to take
its place in the canon of eminently useful books
about the world's greatest dramatist.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Subtitled</ENAMEX>, after
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The World in Words</ENAMEX>, this is the first work to
organize and classify the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> vocabulary,
a formidable undertaking, and an eminently
successful <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.  For the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> maven, this
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-volume lexicon could become habit-forming.  In
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spevack</ENAMEX>'s concise (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> pp.) and witty <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preface</ENAMEX>,
he defines his broader purpose in compiling this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">treasury</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s idiolect as an attempt to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mirror</ENAMEX>, not only the figurative universe of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s
words, but the literal world of the Elizabethan
age as well.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contemporaries</ENAMEX> regarded
speech as God's greatest gift to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>; and speech, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabethan</ENAMEX> thought, was the ultimate test of power.
It was also piously believed that speaking truth
would always prevail over evil; language was not
only a moral weapon, but in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s fecund
and often irreverent imagination, occasion for exuberant
revelry:


Moth: They have been at a great feast of languages,
and stolen the scraps.

Costard: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>!  they have lived long on the almsbasket
of words.  I marvel thy master hath not
eaten thee for a word; for thou art not so long
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> as honorificabilitudinitatibus.

[<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Love's Labour's Lost</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.]

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spevack</ENAMEX> lists that final blend word under
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communication</ENAMEX> (subgroup Pseudo foreign), along
with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> other tongue-twisters, among them, oscorbidulchos
and kerelybonto.
            

            At the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s birth in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1564</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English language</ENAMEX> was besieged by foreign importations--<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-by-the-yard</NUMEX>.
Thought, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia Woolf</ENAMEX> said,
plunged into a sea of words and came up dripping.

            An inspired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">originator</ENAMEX> of compounds ( cloud-capp'd
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">towers</ENAMEX>; home-keeping wits), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> created
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no fewer than 273</NUMEX> for anatomy alone, cited
with almost palpable enthusiasm by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Professor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spevack</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of these fusions could very well be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contemporary</ENAMEX>: rug-headed, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">urchin-snouted</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agueface</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an</NUMEX> in-your-face gibe delivered to the asinine
Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Aguecheek</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twelfth-Night</ENAMEX> ).

            Those who have always thought (or been
taught) that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hamlet's Get</ENAMEX> thee to a nunnery
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rudely</ENAMEX> suggests that poor <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ophelia</ENAMEX> hie herself to a
brothel, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spevack</ENAMEX>, ignoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Partridge</ENAMEX>
and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>, will have none of
that interpretation.  A nunnery may be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>,
an abbey, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX>, a cloister, or a priory.  Period.

            Not that the world's oldest profession is in any
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> slighted in the book and volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Professor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spevack</ENAMEX>'s brain: under strumpet (main heading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Humans</ENAMEX>,
Family, Friendship) there are fifty-eight references,
among them, blowze, giglet, stewed prune,
and quail.  In contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, quail has
shifted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>; since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1860</TIMEX>, quail in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> has continued
to mean a sexually attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>.

            Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bastard</TIMEX> (the only equivalent male counterpart
to whore ) is listed rather benignly under the
heading, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Family</ENAMEX>, we find under rogue (the sole alternative
to bastard ) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> equivalents, including
drumble, scroyle, and varletto.
            

            Among the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">897</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subgroups</ENAMEX>, all models of clarity and superbly indexed,
subjects range from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physical World</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sense Perception to Law to Religion to Time</ENAMEX> and
Space.  There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">509</NUMEX> references to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>; fifty-nine
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>; fifty-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> and nuts; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX>
to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, and eighteen to herbs.  One wonders
if a nobleman or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> could be such
a keen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> of the field and forest,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sea</ENAMEX> and air, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">naturalist</ENAMEX> of
Warwickshire, who knew his <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX> as well
as their many distinctive attributes.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamlet</ENAMEX> is possibly the best known of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s
works (and surely the most quoted).  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spevack</ENAMEX> makes short shrift of the lengthy debate
over <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hamlet</ENAMEX>'s I know a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawk</ENAMEX> from a handsaw (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).  The line, admittedly confusing, is often played
(sometimes mimed! ) as though <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hamlet</ENAMEX> could not tell
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">prey</ENAMEX> from a cutting tool.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawk</ENAMEX> is, in fact,
simply another kind of tool, used to this day by plasterers
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masons</ENAMEX>.

            In the ninety-two entries under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Decay</ENAMEX> and Sickness we find further echoes of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hamlet:</ENAMEX>
blast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">carrion</ENAMEX>, foul, mildew, peak, rank, gross,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rotten</ENAMEX>, unweeded, thought-sick.
            

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the many benefits of this finely tuned
work is not only that meanings, but shades of meaning
are made clear, especially helpful for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>.  In many instances, one may
come fairly close to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s meaning.  To miss
the crucial element of emotive charge that even a
simple, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-syllable word may convey, to lose or
pass over the nuance of meaning is to lose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s
feeling as well.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Othello</ENAMEX>'s account of his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">courtship of Desdemona</ENAMEX>, he says:


...she thank'd me,
And bade me, if I had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> that lov'd her,
I should but teach him how to tell my story,
And that would woo her.  Upon this hint,
I spake:...
[I<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX>]

            

            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spevack</ENAMEX>, the word hint has
no connotation of invitation or covert suggestion:
it simply means cue or suggestion; but should not
be construed in the modern sense of innuendo, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sly</ENAMEX>, or teasing, which it came to mean by the end
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>.  This is, to be sure, a super-subtle
distinction; but these bits and pieces of
Shakespearean usage can make a luminous difference
both in reading and in performance.

            In the merest quibble, the word limbeck ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macbeth</ENAMEX> ,
I, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) is missing from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spevack</ENAMEX>'s compendium,
although it appears to be standard usage
in most editions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macbeth</ENAMEX>.  But, alembic, of which
it is a common aphetic form, is there, and it means
the same thing.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spevack</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have
charted the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s mind, casting
a new and penetrating light on the infinite variety
of his imagination.  We are the richer for their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">perseverance</ENAMEX>.

            Death <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>
            Owing to my being unable to find the full bibliographical
information for it in my infallible library
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cataloguing</ENAMEX> system, I cannot provide more than the
fact that a book published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years ago</TIMEX> by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scarecrow Press</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Slang and Jargon of Drugs</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Drinks</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. A. Spears</ENAMEX>, was recalled when I saw the
Death <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>: they are similar only in that they
are both thesauruses (in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Roget</ENAMEX>'s sense of the
word--that is, they contain all sorts of direct and
oblique references to the subjects they cover).  Anyone
who has any doubts about the flush nature of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English lexicon</ENAMEX> and the propensity of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> to
coin metaphors should attend to these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> works (at
least), for they deal with only a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> of
culture.  I do not mean, of course, to disparage the
capacity of other languages in their ability to exhibit
such a fine array of words and phrases pertaining to
a particular subject, but, if it is common, I am unaware
of it.

            The subtitle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX> is, Over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinical</ENAMEX>,
Legal, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Litterary and Vernacular Terms</ENAMEX>.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>, when I made reference to the expression join
the majority, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> who likes to deal with such
things wrote to advise that the expression was no
longer literally true, for the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living
now exceeds the total of all who had ever lived.  (I
apologize for being unable to give the exact reference,
but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> index goes only through Volume
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>.)  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> cannot argue against such wisdom,
but its validity does not mitigate our capacity to say
anything we like, including, The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> is flat and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adolf Hitler</ENAMEX> was really a sweetie.  Factual or not,
join the majority is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX> , along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,499</NUMEX>
other terms.  The range is quite wide, running from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> cakewalk Death by hanging, through buy
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thyestean</ENAMEX> banquet A feast at which human
flesh is eaten, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tlaloc Aztec</ENAMEX> myth .  A rain
god to whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were sacrificed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drowning</ENAMEX>.  As can be seen, this book is a veritable
treasure trove of arcane information.  The entries include
the facetious ( throat trouble Death by hanging;

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrocution</ENAMEX>), the legal and legalistic ( executory

failure in meeting society's standards), the poetic

            The book has an interesting Introduction,
which, for some reason, has a bibliography different
from the one beginning on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">193</NUMEX>.  Although the
entire book constitutes, as mentioned above, a sort
of thesaurus, there is actually a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Thesaurus</ENAMEX> section
where, under main headings like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abortion, Afterlife</ENAMEX>,
Assassination, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Autopsy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burial</ENAMEX>, etc., are listed synonyms
arranged under categories like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Examination</ENAMEX>,
Investigation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medical Examiner</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgue</ENAMEX> (for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autopsy</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>, exhumation,
Mound, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Premature</ENAMEX>, Preparation for, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Receptacle</ENAMEX>,
Shroud, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Types</ENAMEX> (for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burial</ENAMEX>).

            Aside from its linguistic, lexicographic, and social
uses, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Death Dictionary</ENAMEX> is highly recommended
not only for its approach and treatment but
as a course of study for any who have contemplated
death in the abstract or in its ineluctable reality--
their own or somebody else's.

            [The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centennial</ENAMEX> in the title refers to that of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Dialect Society</ENAMEX>, not of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Usage</ENAMEX>.]

            This collection of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> represents
a broad spectrum of opinion, chiefly by linguists
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, some of whose names will be
familiar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>.  The smooth perusal of
the articles is aided by a minimum of footnotes (at
the ends of the essays), with a detailed bibliography
(pp. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">205-21</ENAMEX>) at the back of the book, followed by a
useful Index of the words discussed.  The essays
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">treat</ENAMEX> usage from historical and contemporary perspectives,
including material on the usage of classes
of words (like pronouns of reference), specialized
vocabulary, comparative treatment in dictionaries
and usage reference books, visual style, and other
topics that are likely to interest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>.

            It is not often that this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentator</ENAMEX> has the opportunity
to commend a book as a bargain, but it
would be difficult to find a book of this value among
commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>' books at such a price.  Those
who wish to join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The American Dialect Society</ENAMEX> are
welcome on the payment of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30</NUMEX> (regular membership

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logophile's Orgy</ENAMEX>
            If one is to acknowledge that it is unfair to express
personal prejudice in reviewing books, then
the entire reviewing process might as well be rejected
as pointless: a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX>'s opinions are valid only
when he has gained a following among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> who
agree with--or, at least, respect--his point of view.
The issue arose (again) when I grappled with the
purpose of this book.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> must accept the premise
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s introductory words:


The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logophile's Orgy</ENAMEX> began as wondering about
other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>' favorite words...The thrust of
the book is that we all have favorite words...
I, for example, use the words eggplant and
kumquat more often in my writing than other
words...

            

            The problem is that the words selected‚Äî <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">summer afternoon</TIMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry James</ENAMEX>), powwow, pulchritude, punctuate
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shirley Lord</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preposterous</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krauthammer</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell M. Raab</ENAMEX>)--often
appeal because of personal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> and not for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">euphony</ENAMEX> (unlike classics like murmur and smooth ).
On the grounds of euphony, many would reject
words beginning with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> or containing a k -sound; on
other grounds, there may be someone out there
whose favorite word is kreplach.  It is not hard to see
why publicity- and work-hungry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">actresses</ENAMEX> might like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ubiquitous</ENAMEX>, but it would be wise to give up attempts
at analysis before coping with eggplant and kumquat,
though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frumkes</ENAMEX> does suggest that they reflect a proclivity
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ovoid objects</ENAMEX>.

            Not all those invited to contribute are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>,
and one is moved to wonder why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ricardo</ENAMEX>
Montalban, (the ubiquitous, to borrow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cybill Shepherd</ENAMEX>'s
favorite) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phyllis Diller</ENAMEX>, and other major and
minor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> were solicited.  Many are so uncelebrated
or of such transitory glory that they have
been provided with identifying squibs: (cookbook
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">writer</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maida Heatter</ENAMEX>'s favorite is chocolate; (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Ace Greenberg</ENAMEX>'s, omphaloskepsis
(probably after eating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kreplach</ENAMEX> and a good reason
for finding another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX>); (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gloria Estefan's</ENAMEX>,
houndation, weirdness, plethora, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of which is
not in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">dictionaries</TIMEX>; and, finally, (entertainer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magician</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penn Gillette</ENAMEX>'s dysphonic ruckus.
            

            Those to whom all that is acceptable as a basis for
a book may find enjoyment, intellectual fulfillment,
and other reward in acquiring it.  At a stretch, one
might regard it as a book of (rather longish) quotations
dealing with a particular theme.  The contributors
are listed alphabetically at the front, then their
contributions appear in the same order; there is no
index of words, so one cannot compare and/or contrast
selections.  As for this reviewer, he would have
preferred looking at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> rather than the paper.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Urdang</ENAMEX>
         
         
            Quotations with an Attitude
            One has to be in the right mood for this sort of
thing, and I was particularly so at the time I picked it
up for review.  In the context of the book, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wickedly</ENAMEX>
Funny must be interpreted as meaning cynical, bitter,
sarcastic, though when it comes to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phyllis Diller</ENAMEX>, who is more vulgarly tragic (or tragically
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vulgar</ENAMEX>) than funny, it must include self-deprecating
comments (Old age is when the liver spots
show through your gloves; My plastic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX> told
me my face looked like a bouquet of elbows).  It is
misleading to call this a book of quotations: most extracts
are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comedians</ENAMEX>' one-liners, and the better comedians--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodman Ace</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Groucho Marx</ENAMEX>,
and a few others--produce the better one-liners.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Goldwyn</ENAMEX> could scarcely be characterized
as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humorist</ENAMEX>, so his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldwynisms</ENAMEX>, rumored to
be the product of a publicity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, at least qualify
as quotations.  Similarly for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voltaire</ENAMEX> (not funny),
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Fuller</ENAMEX> (The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is not likely to recover
who makes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> his heir--clever but not
funny), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bertrand Russell</ENAMEX>  (There is much pleasure
to be gained from useless knowledge--wise but
not funny), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sigmund Freud</ENAMEX> (Sometimes a cigar
is just a cigar--a straight line funny only to us).  I
should say that the book is entertaining, even amusing;
but it is rarely funny: if you enjoy her performances,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rita Rudner</ENAMEX> is funny on stage saying The
closest I've gotten to a m√©nage-√†-trois was dating a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">schizophrenic</ENAMEX>, but it is not funny to see its concocted
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cleverness</ENAMEX> in print.

            The book is organized under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> major headings
(<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Human Animal, Human Endeavor</ENAMEX>, etc.), with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">varying</ENAMEX> number of subcategories under each (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birth</ENAMEX> &
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Childhood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Youth</ENAMEX>,...Memory,... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanity</ENAMEX> &
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madness</ENAMEX>).  The quotations are listed in rather haphazard
order under these subcategories; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> (including
rare attributions to the most popular, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Anon.</ENAMEX>) are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ascribed</ENAMEX> and, if they are dead, their dates are sometimes
given (but none for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenny Bruce</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sigmund</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freud</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Goldwyn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Groucho Marx</ENAMEX>, etc.); it is
hard to understand the style.  If one is interested only
in what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronnie Shakes or Marty Indik</ENAMEX>--Who
they?--had to say, there is an Index, but it does not
list Anonymous.  There is even a quotation evidently
prepared by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>: Why is life so tough?  Perhaps
it was cooked too long. -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of North</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolina-Charlotte Philosophy Department</ENAMEX> .  Things
must be really bad for the tarheels.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Urdang</ENAMEX>
         
         

            I find <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Imber</ENAMEX>'s comments on rhyming
slang, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.  Abootty</ENAMEX>'s short essay on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerala Billingsgate</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Lewis</ENAMEX>' neat exposition of English
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permutations</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>] particularly entertaining and
informative.

            For me the most interesting thing about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX>' table is that although I assume it works for his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London English</ENAMEX>, it does not quite work for my standard
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX>.  In my <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, as in that of
most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bawd/bored/board, sword/sawed/</ENAMEX>
soared , and or<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/oar/awe/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ore</ENAMEX> are not homophones; I
pronounce <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">bawd</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sawed</ENAMEX> differently from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> and
or/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">oar</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ore</ENAMEX> differently from awe . (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incidentally</ENAMEX>, presumably
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> sight in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">triplet</ENAMEX> cite/
sight/sight ought to be site .)

            Such observations about the differences between
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX> put <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in mind
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Charles</ENAMEX>' (a/k/a the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wales</ENAMEX>) deprecation
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idiom</ENAMEX> and denunciation of its
incursions into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English English</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Porter</ENAMEX>, in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disapproving</ENAMEX> article in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Guardian Weekly</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 1995</TIMEX>, quotes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> as declaring, We must
act now to ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>--and that to my way
of thinking means <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English English</ENAMEX>--maintains its position
as the world language.  As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Porter</ENAMEX> comments,
He might as well demand a rematch of the
battle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saratoga</ENAMEX> for all the success he is going to
have.  But we may concede that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British English</ENAMEX>, vocabulary,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pronunciation</ENAMEX>, and all, is still in competition
with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX> and even clings to a limited
superiority of prestige.  On <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> wedding
invitations honor is often still spelled honour , some
pretentious theatrical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprises</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> spell
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">theater theatre</ENAMEX> , and in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mustard</ENAMEX> ads on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
television you won't hear filthy-rich senior citizens
say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bud</ENAMEX>, you got any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grey Poupon</ENAMEX>?

            I find cultivated <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> speech often hard to
understand, nor do I think this is entirely owing to
unfamiliarity with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> phonology.  The fact that there
is no distinction in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> pronunciation of some
words, such as sword/sawed , that I pronounce differently
supports my idea that my <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is phonemically
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fuller</ENAMEX> than even cultivated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> speech.

            And then there is the case of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who
feared for her hearing.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years ago</TIMEX> she consulted
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> specializing in auditory problems.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> examined her inner ears and tested her
hearing, which he found normal, and then asked,
Why did you think you were going deaf?  My
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend</ENAMEX> replied, Well, lately I have had trouble understanding
what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are saying--especially on
TV. What do you watch on TV?  the doctor
wanted to know.  Not much lately.  I'm down
pretty much just to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Masterpiece Theatre</ENAMEX> .  Well,
there's your answer, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> said; I can't understand
that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British English</ENAMEX>, either.

            I have just read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poetic Licenses</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paula van</ENAMEX>
Gelder, in VERBATIM [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>], which illustrates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">License Plates</ENAMEX> (ELPs) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>.  Ms.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gelder</ENAMEX>'s article deals with transpositions of letters
which strikes me as a sort of stonemasonry.
There is another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELPs</ENAMEX> which requires a
different level of imagination and which I think of as
sculpture.  Here are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the latter:

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One day</TIMEX> I drove up behind, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Peugeot</ENAMEX> with

A very small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> passed me with the license plate
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">XX YY</ENAMEX>.  I had to exceed the speed limit to pass him
and to see that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> was a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with a
pointed beard, exactly what I should expect a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">geneticist</ENAMEX>
to look like.

A browse through dictionaries will provide many more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gems</ENAMEX>.  Good hunting!

            

         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Et tu</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brutus</ENAMEX>, old chap!



            I recently watched a program on television
which featured somebody called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Levan</ENAMEX> --a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> name
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pronounced LEEVan</ENAMEX>.  I cannot get it out of my head
that this chap is named after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee van Cleef</ENAMEX>.  I know it
is silly, but there it is.  I also find myself making up
similar names which might turn out to be popular,
like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Susanbee, Henrythee, Popejohn, Franklindee</ENAMEX>, and
so on.

            Along these lines, another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> name fashion
has come along.  This time it is for names ending with
the masculine suffix - us, the most recent example to
receive publicity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> being <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX>.  We all
know that young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> can't resist these fashions
any more than they can resist the new clothing styles
that come along, but where will it all end?  Many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> would recoil in horror at being considered
fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> with regard to names, but when your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Titus</ENAMEX> ) are in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> with Tacitus
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rufus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D√</ENAMEX>¶dalus you can be consoled by
the fact that in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> down the road, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Danii</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du'aine</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gluteus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mucus</ENAMEX> ) are
being mercilessly ragged by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tahini</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pooh</ENAMEX>, themselves
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elvis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moonbeam</ENAMEX>.
            

            Yes, it is true!  Fresh from a demi-generation of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> calling their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moonflower</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Droplet</ENAMEX>,
they are jumping, or being pulled, on to the latest
bandwagon as a result of that curious human trait
which makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> want to be twee and different.
It is clever to have a slightly unusual name for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brats</ENAMEX> because it makes them stand out from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>--at least for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX>--until that virus,
or whatever it is that goes round the maternity
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wards</ENAMEX> when suddenly every other poppet is called
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jason</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tracii</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wayne</ENAMEX>.
            

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX> there is a law which prevents registering
silly or unusual names for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.  Apparently
at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were choosing names like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thunderstorm or Fisherman</ENAMEX>, these being inspired by
current events.  A similar rule exists in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, where
names must be chosen from a prescribed, though extensive
list.  However, it is not the same where I live:
I am regularly confronted with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> whose names
I last saw on the menu of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maharajah</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>.

            We all know that names, or most of them, mean
something.  More often than not, we in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> do not
know what they mean, whilst <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boulogne-sur</ENAMEX>-Mer
to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> seem to know exactly their
meaning and history.  In a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tehran</ENAMEX>
(in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>) a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waitress</ENAMEX> told me that her name meant
the sound of small bells heard tinkling across the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">valley</ENAMEX>.  Yes, I thought then, I bet it does.  Only
now, I realize, she was telling me the absolute truth.
Understanding that names really do mean something,
perhaps we could ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to think more carefully
when choosing them.  For instance, if you want your
latest to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, then choose a solid trustworthy
name like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>, but change your surname to something
like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Budge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bilbo & Tweep</ENAMEX>.  If you want a master
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">builder</ENAMEX>, use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timber</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lintel</ENAMEX>.  You might even
consider the persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> habit of giving only
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">initials</ENAMEX> as names and call your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>-to-be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSJ</ENAMEX> or
your just-announced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Gardeners</ENAMEX>
could be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jeyes</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bethany</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Astronauts</ENAMEX>
could be Rocket or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luna</ENAMEX> or even <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> .  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>
could be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX>.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chef</ENAMEX> could be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenwood</ENAMEX> or even
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chefette</ENAMEX>.
            

            Place names were a favorite for surnames at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>--why should they not do double duty as first
names?  I favor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bath</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolton</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Barton-le-Beans</ENAMEX> for
a plumber, carpenter, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX>, respectively.
This has a satisfying economy of word usage which
pleases me no end.

            It isn't even necessary to be given these names
at birth, because there cannot have been so many
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smiths</ENAMEX> in olden times and I have a suspicion that
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> give themselves new names when they
take a new job where nobody knows them.  How
else would we explain the suddenly large number of
Krystles, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Daleys</ENAMEX>, and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Fionas</ENAMEX> who have suddenly
become ffyona?
            

            And speaking of giving yourself something you
weren't born with, what about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> for a safecracker,
Tealeaf for a shoplifter, and perhaps Bogus
for a conman, which brings us back to square one!

            
               In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring of 1994</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> toothpaste commercials
referred to plaque as plock; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX>
later, they referred to it as plack.  What the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
put on (both our) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> remains plock.
            

            
               
                  No problem
               

               Talking about (or in) clich√©s, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> in The
Independent recently commented on No problem:
Why, she quoted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, when I ask for a pint,
should the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barman</ENAMEX> feel it necessary to reassure me
that I am not making an unreasonable request?  Our
sentiments exactly.  In similar situations, especially
when one has bought something in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>, bar, or
wherever and says Thank you (when it is really the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesperson</ENAMEX> who should have said that), the reply
should have been either Thank you  or You're welcome.
The response No problem is probably intended
as a sincere expression of willingness to serve,
but it comes across as a polite way of saying, I don't
really mind your having taken up my valuable time
coping with the mentally and physically taxing demands
imposed by your overbearing, though trivial
request, because I am an accommodating, thoughtful
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> paid to occupy myself with major decisions
concerning issues of earthshaking consequence, with
but don't let it happen again implied.  There is no
doubt that this one is here to stay--at least for a
while--if its reflexes elsewhere ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kein Problem, Pas de</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">probl√©me</ENAMEX>, etc.) are any indication.  We <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">devoutly</ENAMEX> wish
that it will either disappear or quickly acquire the
meaninglessness of other well-established clich√©s.
            
         
         
            The joy of jabberwocking




            If you do not worry about the borogoves (or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">borogroves</ENAMEX>) being mimsy while the slithy toves were
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gyring</ENAMEX> and gimbling in the wabe, you should not
bother to read this piece.  Others of you, of course,
know about these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">splendid beasts</ENAMEX>, and their activities,
in the poem <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jabberwocky</ENAMEX>, which is found in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Carroll</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alice</ENAMEX> through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Looking-Glass</ENAMEX>.
Some of the nonsense words from this poem have
been taken into standard dictionaries of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
language.  Jabberwocky itself is given in The Concise
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oxford Dictionary</ENAMEX> as designating nonsensical writing
or speech, esp. for comic effect.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s New
World gives this: meaningless syllables that seem to
make sense; gibberish.

            You may remember that the jabberwock, burbled
as it came whiffling through the tulgey <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>.
The verb burble, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Concise Oxford</ENAMEX>,
means speak ramblingly, make murmuring noise.
As a noun it now means a murmuring noise; a rambling
speech.  It also says that it is an aeronautical
term meaning, (of an air-flow) break up into turbulence.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carroll</ENAMEX> may have taken it from the Scots
language, in which it means to bubble or boil up,
like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>; for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scots</ENAMEX> burble-headed
means stupid, confused.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whiffle</ENAMEX> is defined as be
variable or evasive.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scots</ENAMEX> it means either to
drive before the wind or to play the fife or flute. I
like to think that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jabberwock</ENAMEX> played the flute in
the tulgey <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>.  According to the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carroll</ENAMEX>
coined tulgey to designate a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> that is thick,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dense</ENAMEX>, and dark.

            Others of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carroll</ENAMEX>'s verbal concoctions are now
found in our dictionaries, such as slithy (probably
from slither ), gyre (from gyrate, perhaps), and chortle
utter a low, deep laugh.  There is the splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galumphing</ENAMEX>,
which, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chambers English Dictionary</ENAMEX>
now means to stride along exultantly; to
bound about in an uncoordinated, noisy way.  Then
we are given frabjous, as in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">O frabjous day</TIMEX>!, which
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concise Oxford</ENAMEX> allows straightforwardly as meaning
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">delightful</ENAMEX>, joyous and has provided the adverb,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frabjously</ENAMEX>.
            

            Incidentally, the time at which the slithy toves
were doing things in the wabe and the borogoves
were going all mimsy was brillig, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humpty</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dumpty</ENAMEX> said is <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four o'clock in the afternoon</TIMEX>--the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> when you start broiling things for dinner.

            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carroll</ENAMEX> coined the word borogoves he
gave it only one r, but somehow a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> gave it
a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> r, as in borogroves.  This led to great confusion.
For example, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Oxford</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Quotations</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1953</TIMEX>) gave <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- r
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">borogroves</ENAMEX> in its index, but in the text has the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>- r
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">borogoves</ENAMEX>.
            

            Probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years ago</TIMEX> a careless printer put
in that extra r, which an equally careless proofreader
let pass.
