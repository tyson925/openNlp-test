            The thesis of this work is that most legal communication
can and should be expressed in ordinary
words; the sub-text is that, although â€œthe law is
a profession of words,â€™ most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> do not know
much about them and very few are interested in
learning more.  After a short introductory section,
half the book is devoted to a history of legal 
language .
and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> to a critical analysis of its
usage.  The latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> will have more appeal to the
average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, unscholarly primate that he is; but
the language-loving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, which many are and all
ought to be, will be entertained as much as edified
by the eventful chronicle of the forging and tempering
of the tools of his trade.  Of all specialized vocabularies,
that of the law is not only the most commonly
used but by far the most eloquent and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alluring</ENAMEX>.  For that reason, and because they will relish
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s excoriating criticism of the shamanistic
rhetoric employed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> to intimidate
them, lay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are addicted to the lore of
words will find the book as a whole not less fascinating
than do the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> is a piece of scholarship par excellence,
so closely packed and fully realized that no
summary can begin to do it justice.  I shall try to
reduce its gist to a few paragraphs of my own words.

            The history of the legal language of the English-speaking
common law <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> and the history of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language are indissoluble.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celts</ENAMEX>,
those ancient invaders from the continent who managed
to survive the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation</ENAMEX> and resist the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> tongue, contributed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> word-- <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">whiskey</ENAMEX> --
having legal significance but were driven, along with
their reverse-order speech, into the nooks and corners
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Isles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> by the fierce <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angles</ENAMEX>,
Saxons, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jutes</ENAMEX>, wielding their broadswords
and brutish monosyllables.  The Law impressed a
special meaning on many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Anglo-Saxon</ENAMEX> words-- manslaughter,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sheriff</ENAMEX>, theft, hearsay, bench (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX>'s),
strike (motion to), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX>, freehold (in land), and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">herein</ENAMEX> --which they retain to this day.  From the
Viking raids and settlements a few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norse</ENAMEX> words of
Teutonic ancestry survive with technical legal definitions:
gift, loan, sale, bond , and law itself.

            When, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about the year 596</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> Ã†thelbert
promulgated a written <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Anglo-Saxon</ENAMEX> code of law, a
little cloud of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> was rising from the sea.  The
Celtic tongue, later to be overwhelmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anglo-Saxon</ENAMEX>,
contained only a few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> words, most of
them place names and none of legal import, outlived
the occupation.  But the speech of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>-Saxons
themselves had brought to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> a sprinkling of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> words picked up in their trade with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX>.

            At almost the same time that Ã†thelbert pro
claimed his code, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Augustine</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> arrived
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> bringing Christianity and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>,
and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">within a hundred years</TIMEX> the conversation was
complete.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergy</ENAMEX>, was widely introduced
to the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idiom</ENAMEX> and took a strong position
in the law well before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conquest</ENAMEX>.  After the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Conquest English</ENAMEX> remained robustly alive during a
period of bi- and trilingualism: the invading
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Normans</ENAMEX> spoke a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dialect</ENAMEX> which became for a
time the language of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> and the nobility,
while contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> was spoken by the indigenous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population; Latin</ENAMEX> was the language of record
and of the law in general, and so it remained for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two centuries</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conquest</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
as a close <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>.  English fastened upon foreign
words with gusto, transforming and anglicizing them
to lend grandeur and subtlety to the vernacular.  The
upper classes were familiar with both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, the cultivated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> as well.  Although
a statute of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1362</TIMEX> required pleadings to be in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and records in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> became the
principal language of the law and of legal education,
and so continued for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200 years</TIMEX>, although <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> remained
the standard for the â€œall-importantâ€™ writs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œThere</ENAMEX> was nothing written in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> of immediate
practical value to the practising common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> or
law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>.â€™  But the use of English spread and, by
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 14th century</TIMEX>, knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
was â€œan accomplishment.â€™  Indeed, the hallmark of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">authenticity</ENAMEX> was put on it by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaucer</ENAMEX>, who seemed
to be preparing it for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spenser</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>,
and the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elizabethans</ENAMEX>, and for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dryden</ENAMEX>.  Still, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> words in vast numbers,
both of the law and of common speech, continued to
be embraced by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> and, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX>, the law itself
joined that embrace, retaining <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
only for technical terms.

            With the advance of literacy that came with
printing and the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> as a scholarly lingua
franca, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton</ENAMEX> wrote in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> as well as in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, already educated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> as
the learned tongue, incorporated it almost completely
into their writing and in large part into their
oral usage.  To this day, long after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX> has ceased to
be the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> of written legal documents
and records, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> cling to and defend against all
comers unnumbered words and phrases in that ancient
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tongue</ENAMEX>, under the persuasion, justified or not,
that they enrich the legal vocabulary with precision,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">permanence</ENAMEX>, and dignity.

            Anticipating our contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Plain English</ENAMEX>
laws, strong voices were raised in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>
against the use of foreign tongues as a kind of black
art to mystify the uneducated and cheat them of
their rights.  Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, they said, ought to be able
to understand the law and act on his own behalf.  In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1650</TIMEX> and again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1713</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> passed laws
(written almost entirely in derivatives of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>) requiring that all court proceedings be in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  Both laws were bitterly resisted by the
bench and bar, and because of such pressure the
later one was eviscerated before it went into effect
by an amendment allowing the continued use of customary
words.  This was an age of exiguous technicality
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, an age
when the failure of a syllable lost the cause.  â€œThe
land law was on the move--in a solemn progression
of rules and technical evasions.  This was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of
the ingenious conveyance, the computers of the infinite,
logical word slicers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> in metaphysical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wraiths</ENAMEX>....â€™  The law was â€œencased in a hard shell
of fixed pattern, its language determined by forms
and the deadweight of precedent.â€™

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX>, particularly hostile to lawyers
and their mumbo-jumbo, tried at first simply to
eliminate the profession.  When that failed, they
turned to the do-it-yourself approach, creating a
lively demand for self-instruction books of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Everyman His Own Lawyer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kind</ENAMEX>, foreshadowing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">present-day</ENAMEX> will- and estate-planning kits.  Despite
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>' renunciations of such efforts as â€œchimeras
of ignorance and folly,â€™ the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> continued--and
continues to this day--to yearn for simplicity.

            Law language, it is generally agreed among lay
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> (with a few eccentric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> concurring), is
verbose, pompous, archaic, and obscure.  Applying
his premise that it should agree with ordinary
speech, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mellinkoff</ENAMEX> examines the reasons
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> rely on for the difference.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>'s first line of defence is precision , his
bounden duty to lay down his words so that they
may never be misunderstood.  For this he must use
the finely turned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jeweler</ENAMEX>'s tools of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX>, not the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">carpenter</ENAMEX>'s saws and hatchets of common idiom.
But, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, the steeling grip of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> on
their stilted language is in fact the result of fear.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œ</ENAMEX> `Leave us alone.  Don't change.  Here we stay till
death or disbarment.' â€™  When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> say precision
they think they are saying exact meaning ; but what
they are in truth saying most of the time is exactly-the-same-way --that
is, the traditional way (to have
and to hold) , the way of precedent (â€œcause of actionâ€™),
and the required way (as by statute).  Such
usages may also be exact meanings , and thus, truly
precise , but they are not necessarily so.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX>'
stand-bys such as aforesaid, forthwith, hereafter,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hereby</ENAMEX>, herein, hereinafter , and even the ubiquitous
said are condemned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> as â€œtricky, ducking,
bobbing words,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€™ â€œflabby</ENAMEX> words,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€™</ENAMEX> whose only
claim to precision is their traditional use, not worth
saving.  He also takes whacks at those old chestnuts
and/or and ss .  Under the heaviest duress, such as the
threat of boiling in ink, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> might relinquish all
these; but they will fight to the bitter end and finally
die at the barricades before surrendering their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">whereases</ENAMEX> .  Never mind that, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> says;
Whereas is consistently vague, meaning variously
`the fact is,' `although,' `considering that,' `on the
contrary,' and `that being the case,' with many shadings
in between.  Generally appearing as the final
whereas is the most fatuous and utterly redundant
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of all: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œWHEREAS the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> have orally agreed
to the terms of such sale and desire to reduce
their agreement to writing, Now THEREFORE...â€™
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> is also habituated to doublets and triplets
like fit and proper; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> and effect; give, bequeath
and devise; null and void , and rest, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>,
and remainder .  These seem to me among the less
reprehensible, for they are understandable to ordinary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and are objectionable mainly on the
grounds of repetition rather than obscurity.  More
legal documents than ever before contain laundry
list of such terms, many from the computer's memory
bank, often imparting false profundity and reassurance
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX> like the chant of the auctioneer
but under cold analysis shriveling to redundancy and
confusion.  Never mind all this, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> will cling
to them like the drunkard to his bottle.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> is told that there was once justification
for the term natural life --e.g., â€œ...sentenced
to serve for the rest of his natural life...,<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€™ â€œ</ENAMEX>...to
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy for</ENAMEX> and during her natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lifeâ€™</ENAMEX>--
based on the civil death of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">felon</ENAMEX> and also upon the
state of civil death assumed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monk</ENAMEX> upon his abnegation
of all worldly concerns, but that the phrase
as now applied is â€œoutrageously redundant.â€™  These
words are so universally employed in deeds and wills
that the absence of natural might cause a reviewing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> to question the authorship.  The criticism is
nonetheless valid, though this rejected phrase might
come again into play where some sort of life, as after
brain death , is prolonged by totally artificial means.

            In targeting esoteric words used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> in
place of ordinary ones under the pretense of precision,
it seems to me that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> is wasting ammunition
on words like reasonable, substantial , and satisfactory .
They are words of ordinary speech, with
which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">juries</ENAMEX> are quite comfortable, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> are
as aware as everybody else that they are imprecise.
The law's reasonable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> , from the tribal wisdom of
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who is honest and sensible, is an image that
can be called forth in the mind of every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.  Substantial
performance is something a great deal more
than driving the first nail and a little less than driving
the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, and it survives as a useful tool to prevent
injustice by technicality.  Reasonable doubt may
be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œsow</ENAMEX>'s ear,â€™ but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> understands that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> is telling them to be damned sure the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX>
is guilty before they hang him.  These words
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> concepts that cannot be drawn with straightedge
and compass: their flexibility is essential to
their function.  The subjective satisfactory , and ordinary
word rather than a legal one, is a trouble-maker
and should be avoided.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX> are mad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> in general, but their madness
crescendos, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mellinkoff</ENAMEX>,
in their â€œconsuming passion for precedent .â€™  Mesmerized
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œritual phraseâ€™ stare decisis</ENAMEX> , they
delve into that shelf-devouring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monster</ENAMEX> of confusion
known as Words and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phrases</ENAMEX> and come forth with
â€œlanguage that the profession accepts as precedent,â€™
thus investing such terms as accident and proximate
cause with a false precision.  Accident is indeed elusive
of enduring definition, but a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> may find it
very useful to discover a purported definition in a
case of his own jurisdiction decided upon facts resembling
those at hand.  Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> accept proximate
cause as a necessary term of art and will consider
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s treatment of it as â€œconcise
gibberishâ€™ for which you can â€œget a definition at any
supermarketâ€™ as rather severe.  It embodies a concept
difficult to define: the necessary nexus between
the act and the injury.  We cannot go back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam</ENAMEX>'s
Fall (where we sinned all), certainly; neither can we
require that the safe fall directly on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiff</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>.  Foreseeability , unmentioned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> but
indispensable in the application of proximate cause ,
narrows but does not close the gap.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX>,
again, are free to move within a fenced area.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX>
will understand that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> is inveighing
against precedent only as a false pretense for fake
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX>, but an innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">layman</ENAMEX> straying into
these pages might well take it from the broad-gauged
blasts that the whole doctrine of precedent
is a grand illusion, a sort of pseudo-science like astrology,
in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> count the angels
dancing on the point of a needle:


From faltering beginnings in the sixteenth and
seventeenth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>... [t]he heaped-up precedents
of the substantive [my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">italics</ENAMEX>] law swarm
with trivia, with differences without substantive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distinction</ENAMEX>, with repetitions that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries ago</TIMEX> attained
the rank of platitude.


            

            For the benefit of the uninitiated let me say that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, deluded or not, overwhelmingly believe
that with the exception of constitutions and of statutes
enacted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislatures</ENAMEX> (and rules under them),
precedent is what the law is made of in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>; that the law existed before written language
in the tradition of â€œcustoms that runneth not to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contraryâ€™</ENAMEX> and continues to thrive in the printed decisions;
that the statutes themselves remain unsettled
until rounded out by precedent; that precedents may
become so venerable as to become platitudes but
may also be as fresh as the undried ink on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s
appellate court decision; and that when a lawyer
searches for as recent a decision as he can find, in a
jurisdiction as near as possible, on facts as close to his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX>'s case as possible, never overruled or modified,
and pronouncing the law as clearly as possible,
he is doing what he should be doing and might well
be guilty of malpractice for failing to do so.

            As an instance of the gross imprecision of precedent
the author cites a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX> case in which, despite
the heavy-drinking insured's answer, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œNever,â€™</ENAMEX>
to a question in a life insurance application as to the
use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spirits</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> held the policy valid.  But as I
read the quoted extracts from the opinion, the
court's reasoning was not at all based on a definition
of the word never but on a well-established precedent
holding that to void the policy the misrepresentation
must be such that had the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> known the
truth it would not have issued the policy.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œNo</ENAMEX> insurance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> would have rejected the risk on this
ground,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€™</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>.  An effete <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">northerner</ENAMEX> might
challenge the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>'s finding that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insured</ENAMEX>'s frequent
use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> was not material to the risk, but
this was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bourbon</ENAMEX> was invented
and is regarded as considerably less harmful than
iced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX>'s oath as required by statute and as
everybody knows is the sing-song â€œto tell the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.â€™  Redundant
and imprecise, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>; the whole truth
is a â€œmetaphysical distinction,â€™ and he cites the
much-derided <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Words and Phrases</ENAMEX> .  Well, perhaps.
But consider this:


â€œDid you write the letter?â€™

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œNo.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€™</ENAMEX>  [His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> typed the letter and signed
his name to it.]

â€œDid the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX> stop the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>?â€™

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œNo.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€™</ENAMEX>  [The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX> held up his hand and
blew his whistle and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> then stopped the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>.]
            

            Unless a skillful cross-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiner</ENAMEX> brings out all
the facts, a lying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> may avoid a perjury conviction.

            If legal language were to be stripped of ordinary
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, repetition, tradition, precedent, and requirement,
there would still remain, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> Mellinkoff
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">begrudgingly</ENAMEX> concedes, â€œa nubbin of precisionâ€™
from its terms of art .  These â€œtechnical terms
with specific meaningsâ€™ are a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œmere sprinkling</ENAMEX>,â€™ as
seldom found <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as â</NUMEX>€œnuggets in a salted gold <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX>.â€™  A
neat metaphor, but I would have added, â€œalso as
precious.â€™  In addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s examples of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenant</ENAMEX> , and surrender , I would submit
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">escrow</ENAMEX>, holograph, joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tenancy</ENAMEX>, tenancy in common,
precatory subrogation (none of which is mentioned
in the book), and the invaluable per stirpes ,
all terms of art far more precise than any ready
equivalent in backyard <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  Phrases like mutually
agreed and were intermarried are plainly pompous
rather than precise, as are removed for `moved,'
determine for `terminate,' and many more.

            â€œAs precision is the loudest virtue of the law, so
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wordiness</ENAMEX> is its noisiest vice.â€™

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brevity</ENAMEX> is a saving grace, but only if it coincides
with precision and intelligibility.  Voir dire is short
and precise and intelligible; in my opinion, this distinction
can be claimed by many other terms of art,
including tort, fee simple, easement, mens rea , and
prima facie case.  And/or is short but confusing, and
proximate cause (according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>) is short
but unintelligible.

            How truly does the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> say that â€œevery mechanical
aid the law has seized upon to make itself
more available has increased its bulkâ€™!  And this
mushroom cloud has expanded at least a hundredfold
since the book was written.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frankenstein</ENAMEX>
computer with its handmaiden word processor have
spread before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> a feast of gustatory delights
beyond the dreams of his voracity.  Luscious
paragraphs of whereases, corporate powers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trustees</ENAMEX>
duties , and events of default can be mined from these
monster quarries to be fitted, with no other purpose
than to encumber lean documents that already perform
their function.  These machines are pampered
by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-personalizing everything they are fed, converting
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> or simply to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX>, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate</ENAMEX> to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lessor</ENAMEX> (the singular
of course including the plural and the masculine the
feminine or even the neuter, should a party be of
undetermined sex).

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mellinkoff</ENAMEX> traces the verbosity of lawyers
to the historical influences of primitive ritual,
bilingual duplication, and payment by the word; certainly
their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> gave them a running
start over competing professions.  But some would
say that, spurred by their own vanity and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>'
impressionability, they would have reached
the pinnacles of pomposity without having to resort
to these ancient rites.  As â€œwholesale <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> in
words,â€™ the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> maintains, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> of
â€œplanned confusion.<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€™  Witness</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>'s addiction
to it would seem, it may well be , and the like.
But I should have thought that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> could have
learned these and other â€œone-legged subjunctivesâ€™
from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressmen</ENAMEX>, cabinet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ministers</ENAMEX>, and television
talk-show <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> who demonstrate extraordinary
proficiency in such equivocations.

            In the beginning the law was the word itself, not
the abstraction that gave it birth.  Therefore, words
must be durable, it was believed, lest a change in a
word change the meaning of the law.  A subtle concept,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">convincingly</ENAMEX> explained by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>.  To be
durable without writing the law had to be rememberable,
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>'s penchant for repetition
comes from an outmoded attachment to mnemonic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">devices</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assurance</ENAMEX> of rememberability in written
law rests in the artful remarks (usually witty and
nearly always metaphoric) of such rare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurists</ENAMEX> as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lord Bowen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œ...the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">man</ENAMEX>'s mind is as much of a fact as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digestionâ€™; â</ENAMEX>€œA word is not a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crystal</ENAMEX>, transparent and
unchanged: it is the skin of a living thought....â€™

            In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> as in the courtroom legal language
is intended to impress laymen.  Sometimes expectations
must be met.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œSir Leicester</ENAMEX>,â€™ the author
quotes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bleak House</ENAMEX> , â€œappears to have a stately
liking for the legal repetitions and prolixities as
ranging among the national bulwarks.â€™  If the contract
prepared for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX> lacks the usual flourishes,
he may feel that he is paying for something he
could have written himself.  On the other hand,
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> appreciate plain wording.

            Also, legal language endures to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œunite the
priesthood,â€™ that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œdiscipline</ENAMEX> [may] not be made
common among the vulgar.â€™

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> more reasons might have been added in
support of a language of the law distinct from common
speech.  First, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œTo Impress the Client</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€™</ENAMEX> discussed
under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Durability</ENAMEX> , should not be limited to
that category.

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> is â<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">€œTo Persuade the Judge or Jury</ENAMEX>.â€™  The
good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, always mindful of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX>'s definition
of the law as â€œthe prophecies of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> will
do in fact and nothing more pretentious,â€™ will ask
himself when drafting any instrument, â€œHow will
this hold up in court?â€™  Indeed, this reason overrides
all others.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> is but another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, seldom
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the more erudite, and he might be more amenable
to the old familiar tunes than to start minimalism,
however pure or precise.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jury</ENAMEX> trials in most
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> the complaints and answers stating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>'
claims and denials are read to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> as part of the
instructions, can be quoted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> in argument,
and may be sent to the jury <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>.  The lawyer
serves his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> by employing his most impressive
language: the collision was one of â€œgreat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> and
violence,â€™ the injuries â€œsevere,â€™ the pain â€œexcruciating,â€™
and the mental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anguish â€œextreme</ENAMEX>.â€™  He is being
paid for persuasion, not simplification.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> addition would be â€œStyle,â€™ pure style.
Surely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, no less than other artisans, are entitled
to their little conceits, a grace note here, a furbelow
there.  When I was young at the bar I heard
with delight an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, who could have played
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tulkinghorn</ENAMEX>, speak grandly of the
court of nisi prius (pronouncing it NICEY PRY-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>), an
utterly obsolete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latinism</ENAMEX> for the simple trial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> .
Just as any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> may, for the sake of euphony (or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vanity</ENAMEX>) flourish an occasional eminence grise or mirabile
dictu , may not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> plume himself now and
then with an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ab initio</ENAMEX> or even a mutatis mutandis ,
not to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œunite the priesthoodâ€™ but to savor his own
sonority, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> sings also for itself?

            The book as a whole is most praiseworthy.  The
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>, unique and unfaultable, will fill a huge gap
in the knowledge of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> who are not far more
scholarly than any I have ever known.  The writing in
0both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">halves</NUMEX>, though lean and muscular--the author
falls prey to none of the ills of turgidity that he so
lavishly dispraises--is polished and witty, spiced
with revealing anecdotes and sparkling detail.  In
those few cases with which I have ventured to disagree,
I have felt that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s argument was unworthy
of his art.

            As for the impact on the profession, one must,
with a sigh, agree with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mellinkoff</ENAMEX> that
â€œgratuitous literary advice ... is received with profound
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">indifferenceâ€™</ENAMEX> and that â€œthe hardest words of
lay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swift</ENAMEX> to date ... have been ignored
with aplomb.â€™  In this era of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> unprecedented
wealth and power, few of them will expend many of
their <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">precious minutes</TIMEX> listening to admonitions on
their language.  Still, there are always the â€œ `passionate
few,' a stray <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> here and thereâ€™ according to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, who will fight on in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtrooms</ENAMEX> and
in the ivory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> and in the barrooms,
in the law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> and reviews for the good word,
and they will never surrender.
            In his Preface the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author disarmingly</ENAMEX> tells us that
â€œthe footnotes are for reference onlyâ€™ and that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œanything</ENAMEX> worth saying has been said in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of
the text.â€™  But so provocative is the text itself that I
found myself irresistibly drawn to those generally
annoying tag-alongs in search of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.  I shall
indulge in only this one footnote.  In this writing,
legal means `pertaining to the law,' rather than `lawful';
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">layman</ENAMEX> means `non<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-lawyer</ENAMEX>' (including the feminine);
he, him and his include the feminine; and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Saxon</ENAMEX> means `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old English</ENAMEX>.'  All quotations are

            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Longman Pronunciation Dictionary</ENAMEX>
            This long-needed book will be welcomed by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linguistic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and by learners of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
General dictionaries show pronunciations, it is true,
but not in the depth displayed in this work [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPD</ENAMEX> ],
rarely with its precision, and almost never with both
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> pronunciations side by side.

            The immediate questions that arise are Which
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>?  Which <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>?  The dialect selected for
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General American</ENAMEX>, that spoken
by the largest number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> (those who do not
distinguish among <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>, marry , and merry ); that selected
for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British English</ENAMEX>, as one might expect, RP
[<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Received Pronunciation</ENAMEX>], â€œwidely regarded as a
model for correct pronunciation ... what is used by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> news <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> (hence the alternative name, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pronunciation</ENAMEX> ).â€™  As far as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is concerned, it
does not bear the same relationship to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bears</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>: the pronunciation
pattern of the educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> in the northeastern
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX> probably retains much of its former status
and prestige.  Having listened to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> news
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>, I am inclined to regard <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pronunciation</ENAMEX> as an archaic or obsolescent term (unless
one restricts the designation to news <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC World Service</ENAMEX>).  Certainly, the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> do not pronounce <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in the
RP pattern, and there is increasing evidence that if
they aspire to do so, they are meeting with little
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX>.  But this is not a book of descriptive phonetics;
it is for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">learner</ENAMEX> who aspires to speak the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œbestâ€™ English</ENAMEX> he can, and the selection of these two
dialects would be hard to fault.

            The pronunciation system used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells</ENAMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œbroad IPA</ENAMEX>,â€™ with a few modifications.  It is largely
phonemic, but there are enough refinements to
make it unique.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wells</ENAMEX> calls it â€œLPD.â€™  I found only
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> transcription to quarrel with: by showing \?\ as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General American</ENAMEX> sound in both
lot/odd and start/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wells</ENAMEX> leads one to conclude
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General American</ENAMEX> (like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX>) drops r -sounds in
syllable-final position.  But that is not the case in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General American</ENAMEX>, as the entry for start start bears
out.  There is some confusion in the key, where the
spelled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> represented by the phonetic transcription
are underscored, and the form for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> start should have been start, not start.
Moreover, most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> make a deliberate
distinction between the sounds in odd/lot and
start/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> , with the former often displaying some
rounding or, at worst, closer to \?\ than to \?\.  The
treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> and stir , which show \?\ for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> and
\?\ for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General American</ENAMEX> is closer to the mark.

            When I worked on the setting up of the pronunciation
system for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX> dictionaries, I
examined sound spectrograms of words that middle,
total, sudden, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servant</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, standard , etc., that
some phoneticians transcribed using syllabic \?\, \?\, and
\?\.  What I found was that the syllabics occurred only
when the preceding sound was a dental or alveolar
(d or t); when it was a velar (k or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>), there was
enough time for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> to release a sound which
was more like a full schwa than a syllabic.  Indeed,
though it is a matter of degree, I find it difficult to
pronounce a word like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> with a syllabic Z\?\ at
end rather than a z\?\m.  This is the way organism
is transcribed in the key; but the text itself shows a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full schwa</TIMEX>, which indicates that perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wells</ENAMEX> vacillated
on this point himself.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPD</ENAMEX> lists <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 75,000</NUMEX> words, including
proper names.  The boldface headwords, alas in sansserif
type (making it difficult to read words like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilling</ENAMEX>,
pillion, pilliwinkle, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> , etc., because the
lower-case i resembles lower-case <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l</TIMEX> , which is hard to
distinguish from capital I ), are followed by
pronunciations printed in blue, with variants in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">black</ENAMEX>, an expensive but worthwhile idea that works
if you are not reading in a dim light.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General American</ENAMEX>
pronunciations are easy to find because they
are separated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> by double vertical bars.
Pronunciations that are considered incorrect (like
â€œfithâ€™ for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> ) are preceded by an exclamation
point in a triangle; (!)  indicates that a pronunciation
so marked is different from what the spelling might
lead <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to expect (as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beaulieu</ENAMEX> `bju\?\li and Beauchamp
\?\bi\?\t\?\\?\\?\<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>); (*) is `a warning that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pronunciations</ENAMEX> are different in an important
and unpredictable way' (e.g., baton \?\bÃ¦tan - \?\<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">n Â¦Â</ENAMEX>¦
b\?\\?\ta\?\n).  Useful notes abound, e.g., at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> , â€œThe
pl of the tdmk is pronounced the same as the sing, or
with -i\?\zâ€™; and, passim throughout, results of a poll
taken among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">275</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>, e.g. â€œ casual \?\kÃ¦zu\?\l

\?\kÃ<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">¦3</NUMEX>- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX>, kÃ¦z- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23%</NUMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€™  Separate</ENAMEX> treatment is
given, in situ , to prefixed and suffixes, and detailed
discussions of compounds and phrases, connected
speech, neutralization, and other phonetic matters
and language environments that affect pronunciation
appear in their appropriate alphabetic places.  Each
spelled sound is discussed at the beginning of its alphabetic
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX>, digraphs being treated at the beginnings
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> for their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> letter.

            In sum, there is a wealth of information succinctly
presented in the pages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPD</ENAMEX> which learners,
linguists, and lexicographers will be mining for
many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> to come, including the pronunciation of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllandysiliogogogoch</ENAMEX> .

            What's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">In A Name</ENAMEX>?
            This is a general book about names, in scope if
not in style reflecting the varied articles that appear
in Names , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Name Society</ENAMEX>.
Those articles are normally written in language
meant to demonstrate to the world that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> is
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academic</ENAMEX>; this book reflects more the style of a
classroom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>, a mixture of objective and subjective
comment.  For those who know their name
books, it falls somewhere between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basil Cottle</ENAMEX>'s
Names (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>) and my own <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Guinness Book of Names</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4th</TIMEX> edition <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>).

            I mention the latter merely to make it clear that
I am the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of a rival book which covers very
similar ground, and that any comments I make must
be judged against that background.  Like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Professor</ENAMEX>
Ashley, I have also been immersed in name studies
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least twenty years</TIMEX>.  His book has not been written
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like me, and its real impact will have
to be judged when it gets into the hands of those
intended <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> who are not already onomastic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">freaks</ENAMEX>.  Presumably, much of the book's contents will
be as fresh to such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> as it is familiar to anyone
who already knows his names.  That is not meant to
be a sneer.  Anyone writing a book of this kind is
obliged to go over certain common territory.  It is
how you go over it that matters--how entertainingly,
how clearly, how elegantly, how accurately.

            In the present case I have some worries about
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of those criteria.  Having come across reviewers
who quite clearly did no more than glance at the
book concerned--one of them once wondered in
the pages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> why I had called <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> chapters
of a book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œWhat's In A Name?â</ENAMEX>€™  though the second
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter</ENAMEX> was actually â<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">€œWhat Is A Name?â€™</ENAMEX>--I decided
to give this book a careful reading.  Perhaps it
is not meant to be read in that way.  Consider <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Professor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ashley</ENAMEX>'s opening paragraph, traditionally the
one which an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> reads and corrects most often.
He begins: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œFrom the beginning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had to have
names to identify themselves.  At first, one was
enough.  There are cultures in which one is still
enough, but generally, with increases in population
and refinements in civilization, there arose a need
for additional designations to identify the members
of a society.  To a given name like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John or Mary</ENAMEX> was
appended a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> name, usually an inherited
family name.  With the advent of this `last name,'
which came to be known as a surname (from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> surnom ), given names came to be called `first
names,' or, because we can have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>,
`forenames.' â€™

            The casual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> might let that pass: I find it
difficult to do so.  Surely that opening sentence, as it
stands, is ambiguous?  â€œHad to have a nameâ€™ rather
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">than â€œnamesâ€™</ENAMEX> would have been better, and â€œin order
to identify and refer to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> anotherâ€™ would have
avoided the ambiguity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œthemselves</ENAMEX>.â€™  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> usually
know who they themselves are.  The need for an
additional personal name (in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> rather than
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œgenerally</ENAMEX>,â€™ and not before the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>) arose
more because of the spread of a particular kind of
naming philosophy than an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> or
a refinement in civilization.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Saxons</ENAMEX> did
not allow the duplication of personal names within a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>.  There may have been superstitious reasons
for this, connected with name-magic beliefs
whereby the use of a living <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s name would
deprive him of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>, but the practical result was
that everyone was conveniently identified by a single
name.

            When the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Normans conquered England</ENAMEX> they introduced
their own philosophy of allowing the same
name to be borne simultaneously by many members
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.  This was not necessarily a more refined
philosophy, merely a different one.  The name-magic
belief in this case was that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> named after an
admired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> might cause some of that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s
qualities to be passed on to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>.  That belief is
of course still common <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, though for that matter
so is the other theory.  In many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> it
prevents the use of a relation's name if the person
concerned is still alive.

            For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least three hundred years</TIMEX> the â€œadditional
designationsâ€™ that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX> philosophy made
necessary were not â€œinherited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> names,â€™ but
by-names, which applied only to those who bore
them.  Thus a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Smith</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</TIMEX> really
was a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">smith</ENAMEX> by trade.  His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> might be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> , his
grandson a Large because he happened to be a generous
fellow.  When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surnames</ENAMEX> did become hereditary
they were always, not â€œusually,â€™ the second
names that went with the given names.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashley</ENAMEX> implies that â€œlast nameâ€™ was
the early term â€œwhich came to be known as a surname.â€™
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Surname</ENAMEX> was the original word: last name is
decidedly modern.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Surname</ENAMEX> was indeed an adaptation
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> surnom , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Normans</ENAMEX> called it
that because in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin</ENAMEX> it was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super nomen</ENAMEX> , an `extra
name.'  Without this explanation, the information
that surname is from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> surnom seems to me to
be of very little interest.

            The term forenames is to be preferred to given
names or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> names , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashley</ENAMEX>.  But it
isn't.  Given name is clearly preferable if one wishes
to distinguish between a name bestowed by the parents
in any culture and one automatically inherited.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forename</ENAMEX> fails to help with the problem of those
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> where the given name is always placed
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last</TIMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> name is useful when discussing western
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures</ENAMEX>, since it is usually the â€œcall-name,â€™ as some
languages would describe it.  As for the statement
that we should use forenames â€œbecause we can have
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>,â€™ what on earth is wrong with â€œgiven
names,â€™ or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œfirst name and middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">namesâ€™</ENAMEX>?

            I know that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashley</ENAMEX>'s intended reader
will not nit-pick in this way, but I can only react to
his book (and to each page) as I find it.  To me it
matters that in his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> paragraph, for example,
he says that â€œto <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher the Puritans</ENAMEX> added, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constance</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charity</ENAMEX>, and for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Increase, Preserved</ENAMEX>
and Learned.â€™  That misses the point entirely.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puritans</ENAMEX> substituted such names for the others
because they did not believe in honoring, as they
would have put it, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Popish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>.  In a very general
sense the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puritans</ENAMEX> can be said to have added a few
names to the stock which modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> draw
upon, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> obviously did not mean that.
He was not trying to tell us that names like Increase,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constance</ENAMEX> , and Learned are now in general use
thanks to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puritans</ENAMEX>.

            In paragraph <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> we are told that â€œthe Dare
family named the first white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, not a conventional name in the late sixteenth
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> but hardly daring considering the
religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>.  Indeed along with a slew of native
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> names that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX> transported
to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, the traditional biblical names
would dominate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> birth registers well into the
twentieth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>.â€™  As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashley</ENAMEX> knows, the
state was named in honor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elizabeth I</ENAMEX>, the Virgin
Queen, and not for the Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>.  As for the â€œdaringâ€™
aspect, had the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> been named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia</ENAMEX> in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Puritan community</ENAMEX>, it would certainly have been
very provocative.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puritans</ENAMEX> would definitely
have seen the name as having religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>,
or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Catholic associations</ENAMEX> at least, and would
have objected to it strongly.  Finally, the names
which dominated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX> birth registers until fairly recent
times were specifically <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Testament</ENAMEX> rather
than merely <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œbiblicalâ€™</ENAMEX> names.  It is that which characterizes
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abraham Lincoln</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noah Webster</ENAMEX>, and the
like.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> does not necessarily expect literary elegance
in a book written by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academic</ENAMEX>, but there is
no need to be clumsy.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashley</ENAMEX> writes: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œI</ENAMEX>
cannot pretend to do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> in one section here to a
subject that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George R. Stewart</ENAMEX> almost failed to cover
adequately in his Names on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> .â€™  That turns
out to be a backhanded compliment, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> himself, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> who showed us all what
could be done by way of literary style in his Names
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land</ENAMEX> , would never have written such a sentence.
Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashleyism</ENAMEX>, a few pages later: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œThe</ENAMEX>
book was rendered pretty useless pretty soon by
name changes.â€™  That's pretty awful, I'm afraid.

            There is no index to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">What's in a Name ?</ENAMEX>, which is
as extraordinary as it is infuriating.  The thinking behind
that may be the same as that of another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> I
recently came across, responsible for a little <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> Names .  When I pointed out mildly that
it was usual for a dictionary to be in alphabetical
order, she said that with such an arrangement readers
would merely look for their own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> name in
the bookshop, and then not bother to buy the book.

            Even she, however, did not have an entry saying
something like<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">: â€œThere</ENAMEX>'s a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> on the corner of
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Aragon Avenue</ENAMEX> with an interesting name, but I'm
not going to tell you what it is.â€™  On page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">218</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashley</ENAMEX> writes: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œThere</ENAMEX>'s an old formula for finding
out the name of your personal angel but I won't
trouble you with it.  In addition, I'll wager your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">priest</ENAMEX> won't give it to you.â€™  To that I can only say, as
they do on this side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œThanks a</ENAMEX>

            The reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slurvian</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>] was the first I
had ever heard of it, and as the word is not to be
found in my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> I assume that it is of
rather recent origin.  On the evidence of the examples
quoted, I also wonder whether it is necessary to
construct an artificial sublanguage out of the garbled
forms that inevitably arise when a language is
used by lazy, slipshod, and semi-literate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>.
These forms are not restricted to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, they
come into being wherever <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is used--or
rather abused--as some of the following comments
will show.

            Not far from where I grew up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
Midlands there were <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> in which â€œairâ€™ sounds
were regularly replaced by â€œerr.â€™  A local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preacher</ENAMEX>
who came to our chapel greatly amused us by describing
the encounter of a prophet with a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œburr,â€™ a</ENAMEX>
word that kept recurring in his sermon.  This was
simply a bear , but the pronunciation was different in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bloxwich</ENAMEX> area, as it is in other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> dialects.
If a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bloxwich</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> wanted to ask â€œWhere did he
go?,â€™  he would say â€œWhir-dee-go?,â€™  just like the
â€œWhirred egoâ€™ quoted, with a little word-window-dressing,
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia Howard</ENAMEX>.  Yet you could hardly
call a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bloxwich</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slurvian</ENAMEX>.

            Some of the other examples <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia Howard</ENAMEX>
cites are simply misunderstandings of the sounds
heard, something that inevitably occurs, especially
among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and semi-literates, wherever words
are spoken.  â€œTaking it for graniteâ€™ is a case in point.
This is the same mechanism as is operative in the
famous case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> who heard the hymn
â€œGladly the cross I'd bearâ€™ and thought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>
were singing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about â</NUMEX>€œGladly, the cross-eyed bearâ€™.
When as a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> I listened to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> talking
about breeds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hens</ENAMEX>, I would certainly have written
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œRhode Island Redâ€™ as â€œRow-Dylan-dread</ENAMEX>.â€™

            Another category is formed by the replacement
of unfamiliar-sounding names by something more familiar.
Thus a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dame Jeanne</ENAMEX> (a big fat-bellied bottle)
became a demi-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">john</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, â€œGod encompasseth
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">usâ€™</ENAMEX> became the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Compasses</ENAMEX> , and the girasole
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">sunflower</NUMEX>) artichoke became the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> artichoke .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œsparrow grassâ</ENAMEX>€™ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia Howard</ENAMEX> mentions
used to be--and probably still is--common
usage in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> Midlands for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asparagus</ENAMEX> .

            Other examples cited are probably owing to foreign
influences.  â€œForcedâ€™ for forest would hardly be
surprising among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forst</ENAMEX> is a German
word for forest .  More intriguing is â€œmeowkâ€™ for
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> .  In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernese</ENAMEX> dialect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swiss-German</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">l</ENAMEX> is
replaced by a rather indistinct u sound, so that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German Milch</ENAMEX> becomes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miuch</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">with â€œchâ€™</ENAMEX> as in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œlochâ€™</ENAMEX>).  About the nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> equivalent
would be â€œmeowk,â€™ so it would be interesting to
ascertain whether <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bernese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> might not have
settled in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> at some time.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garblings</ENAMEX> and imbroglios are going on all the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, not only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> or in Slurvian
but wherever the lingo is spoken.  This reminds me
of the worst pun I ever heard.  I was sitting with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> when he noticed another
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> at the far end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>.  He wanted to convey
a message to him, and as there was too much
background noise to do so by shouting, he tried to
mouth his message.  But the other failed to get the
gist of it.  After he had tried <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times in vain, I
suggested in my usual helpful way: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œWhy don't you
try it in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hindustani</ENAMEX>?â€™  My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> shook his head and
replied: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œHe wouldn't Hindustanit if I did.â€™





         
         


            I am beginning to find it irksome to have to
point out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every few years</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Crapper</ENAMEX> did
indeed live and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> he founded lasted
until about 1928.  He was the subject of a biography
entitled (I regret to say), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flushed with Pride</ENAMEX> .  On the
wall of my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX> is a page reproduced from The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Contractor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Compendium of 1892</ENAMEX> which illustrates
and describes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> products of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crapper & Co.</ENAMEX>'s
works, situated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marlborough Road</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chelsea</ENAMEX>.  This
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproduction</ENAMEX> is sold at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gladstone Pottery Museum</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoke-on-Trent</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marlborough Road</ENAMEX> is now, I
suspect, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, to distinguish it from its namesake
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. James</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palace</ENAMEX>.

            The word crap , however, is derived from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Dutch Krappe</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chambers Dictionary</ENAMEX> .
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> attributes the invention of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flushing WC</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Bramah</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1782</TIMEX>; it is said
that the quality of his work made his name a symbol
of excellence and I have heard the expression,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œThat</ENAMEX>'s a bramah,â€™ so used.  On the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Partridge</ENAMEX> derives this usage from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> deity
via <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> army <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">slang</ENAMEX>.

            In this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> drain covers bearing
the words â€œT. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crapper & Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanitary Engineers</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marlborough Works</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chelsea</ENAMEX>.â€™  Cast-iron evidence.





         
         


            I was puzzled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rebecca Christian</ENAMEX>'s mention
in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œBlessed Be the Words That Bindâ</ENAMEX>€™ [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVI,3</NUMEX>] of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œVikki Carr</ENAMEX>'s song, `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Is That All</ENAMEX> There Is?' â€™  I have
never appreciated the popular tendency to credit
songs automatically to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> or recording <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>
or both, not all of whom are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composers</ENAMEX> or lyricists
and not all of whom perform exclusively songs
of their own composition.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œIs That All There Is?â€™</ENAMEX>  was written by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leiber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Stoller</ENAMEX> and made famous in a late
'60s recording by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peggy Lee</ENAMEX>.  Thus it is correct to
refer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Leiber and Stoller song, â€œIs That All</ENAMEX>
There Is?â€™ or to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peggy Lee</ENAMEX> recording of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œIs That</ENAMEX>
All There Is?â€™, but not to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œthe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peggy Lee</ENAMEX> song, `Is
That All There Is?' â€™

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vikki Carr</ENAMEX>'s most popular record (also in the
'60s) was of a song whose refrain began, â€œLet it
please be him.â€™  Unless she wrote it, however, it was
not her most popular song.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yiddish</ENAMEX> has found a cozy niche in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> during

like a hole in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> , formative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> like shm-(fancy/shmancy,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">value/shmalue</ENAMEX>) and -nik (spynik,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noshnik</ENAMEX>) have become common coin in colloquial
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, especially in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.  No book on
current <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is complete without some account of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yiddishisms</ENAMEX>.  The popularity of the subject seems to
have generated a cottage industry in publishing: I
would venture a guess that apart from dictionaries
and grammers, more books about <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> have been
published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> in the past <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty-five</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> than about any other minority language

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bluestein</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Anglish-Yinglish: Yiddish in American</ENAMEX>
Life and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Literature</ENAMEX> , a title that misleadingly suggests
a scholarly work.  This impression is reinforced not
only by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>'s being a university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> but
by the declaration in the Introduction that â€œThis
study is concerned with the function of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> life and literature.â€™  No such study, however,
appears in the book.  Instead, following the
Introduction and constituting the book's main text is
a glossary of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 335</NUMEX> terms entitled â€œAnglish-Yinglish
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX>.â€™  This, clearly, should have
been the book's title.  On the other hand, perhaps
the author deliberately refrained from using this title,
since he is not a professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lexicographer</ENAMEX> and
his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œdictionaryâ€™</ENAMEX> has every mark of an amateurish
piece of work.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> without lexicographic training who undertake
to compile a dictionary run the risk of committing
innumerable blunders of the kind that only
the seasoned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professional</ENAMEX> knows how to avoid.  In
tackling the field of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>.  the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">compiler</ENAMEX> runs the
additional risk of plunging into a discipline that requires
extensive knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">linguistics</ENAMEX>, etymology, and lexicology.  According
to the description on the book's cover, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bluestein</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musician</ENAMEX>, folklorist, and literary critic
who teaches English at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California State University at</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fresno</ENAMEX>.  A lexicographer and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> he is
not.  That he is, indeed, a literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> and folklorist
is demonstrated not only in the generally intelligent
and informative Introduction, but in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">short appendices</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of which, subtitled â€œThe <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>,â€™
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analyzes</ENAMEX> rather well <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Roth</ENAMEX>'s novel,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portnoy's Complaint</ENAMEX> , while the other, titled â€œThe
Revival of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLEZmer Music</ENAMEX>,â€™ discusses lucidly a contemporary
aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> folk music.  It is regrettable
that these fine pieces are marred by the intrusion
of an inferior <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œAnglish-Yinglish Dictionary</ENAMEX>.â€™

            In the brief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preface</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bluestein</ENAMEX> defines <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anglish</ENAMEX> as
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œAnglicized Yiddish</ENAMEX>... which turns <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> words
into colloquial <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> (as in shmo ),â€™ and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yinglish</ENAMEX> as
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œYiddishized English</ENAMEX>, ... which gives English
words and expressions the qualities of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> syntax
and intonation (as in `a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Heifetz</ENAMEX> he isn't').â€™  Even if
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> were to accept this peculiar nomenclature, the
distinction it is supposed to draw is hardly significant,
since these types of formations are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> of
the many characteristics of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish English</ENAMEX> (the collective
terms for all the varieties of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> used by
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>).  The very terms <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anglish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yinglish</ENAMEX> invite
scholarly derision as being both facetious and inaccurate.
To worsen things, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> is not even consistent
within the framework of this distinction.  Most
of the entries in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œdictionaryâ€™</ENAMEX> are not labeled
either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Yinglish</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anglish</ENAMEX>, and for good reason, as
they do not fit into either category.  For example,
adeSHEM , defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œa Hebrew</ENAMEX> euphemism for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tetragrammatonâ€™</ENAMEX>; kakuh-MAYmee , about which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œnot Yiddish</ENAMEX> but it sounds like it,â€™ misspelling
the actual <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word as cockamaimy .

            The entries are a mishmash run riot.  They include
formal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>-interest terms (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladino</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHVH</ENAMEX>) ,
irrelevant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">non-Jewish</ENAMEX> names ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prufrock</ENAMEX> --yes, T.S.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eliot's</ENAMEX>--an entry that runs on for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two and a half</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pages</ENAMEX>), the name of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> theatrical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Tomashefsky</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> literary works ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zohar</ENAMEX> ),
nonce formations ( money/shmoney , which
takes up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pages), misspelled place names to indicate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mispronunciation</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BRANzvil</ENAMEX> , for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brownsville</ENAMEX> , a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> words that are never
used in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> ( FUHLKStimlech `folksy,' guht `God,'
ich starb `I'm dying'), encyclopedic terms ( black
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> ), and nonexistent words ( who-er â€œdefinedâ€™ by
the author as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œNot exactly Yiddish</ENAMEX>, but the New
Yorkish pronunciation of whoreâ€™).

            The equally whimsical nature of the â€œdefinitionsâ€™
defies description.  A nonce word, aKOOSHerke , is defined
as â€œFriddish for midwife,â€™ from which one is to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gather that â€œFriddishâ€™</ENAMEX> (which is nowhere explained)
stands for a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> mixture.  Under bris `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">circumcision</ENAMEX>'
sixteen lines are quoted from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Genesis</ENAMEX> 17
where a simple reference would have sufficed.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> word KETSele (not used in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>), meaning
`pussycat,' is cryptically â€œexplainedâ€™ as a â€œterm of endearment
and the source of all the current pussycat
titles with their sexy connotations.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€™  Go</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX>.

            The pronunciations are indicated in a confusing
and inconsistent â€œnewspaper-styleâ€™ key.  For example,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> â€œuhâ€™ is shown in the key as representing
schwa, yet throughout the book it is used to
represent the vowel sound in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> ball or raw
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BUHbe</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>,' puhGRUHM `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pogrom</ENAMEX>').  An
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word like allrightnik is rendered as allRAITnik
to make it seem <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>.  And so on.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œdictionaryâ€™</ENAMEX> has one saving grace: many of
the entries are illustrated by citations from the
works of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saul Bellow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Heller</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ginsberg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Malamud</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaim Potok</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Roth</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Bashevis Singer</ENAMEX>.  It is a pity
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> (and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>) had not enough
good sense to submit a draft of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œdictionaryâ€™</ENAMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Yiddish scholars</ENAMEX> for scrutiny and criticism.
A fine collection of citations using <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>-origin
words is buried under a rubble of dross.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sol Steinmetz</ENAMEX>

         
         
            What's the Word That Means ...?
            I once told myself that I would not look any further
into a book or article that quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Carroll</ENAMEX>'s
tired old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humpty Dumpty</ENAMEX> quotation about
words meaning what he wants them to mean.  Such a
policy is unfair, of course: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> should not be prejudiced
against a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s magnum opus just because
he has a tiresome taste in quotations.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are forever
discovering such quotations for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time
and should not be excoriated for it by a dyspeptic,
curmudgeonly reviewer.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reviewers</ENAMEX> are supposed to
have--or pretend to have--open, inquiring minds,
and a boring quotation maketh not a boring book--
necessarily.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, I should learn to follow my instincts.

            I suppose that there is a category of reference
book called the reverse dictionary .  There is no denying
that such a work, which would enable a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to
find the word or phrase he is seeking by looking up a
meaning, would be quite useful.  I have a number of
ideas for preparing one in machine-readable form
for use in a computer, but I shall not reveal them
here.  The way printed versions of such books function
is for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to look up associated information.
The main problem with them is that they rely on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compiler</ENAMEX>'s ability to anticipate with some accuracy
the associative contextual framework of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>.
Within the relatively limited amount of information
a bound volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">320</NUMEX> pages can provide, it would
be difficult to anticipate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>'s mind set with sufficient
allowance for elaboration.  The books of this
kind that I have tried to use have frustrated me: I
never can find what I am looking for.

            But I am sufficiently open-minded to forget
what I might be looking for--some bit of lexicographic
esoterica, no doubt--and settle for something
I consider to be much simpler and not readily
derivable from an ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dictionary</ENAMEX>.  As we all
know, if we knew the word we were looking for (and
knew how to spell it) we should not have to resort to
reverse dictionaries.  Trying to be fair, I cooked up a
test or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> (to which most of us know the
answer, I suppose, but that makes it no less legitimate)
is, What is the nautical term for the left and
right sides of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>?  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> cannot discover the answer
by looking up left or right in an ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dictionary</ENAMEX>,
of course.  Unfortunately, neither left nor
right (nor port nor starboard ) is in, and I should have
to hang around yacht <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> to get the answer.  I had
spotted some obscure terms (like widdershins under
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">counterclockwise</ENAMEX> ) when skimming through the
book, so I thought <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welsh</ENAMEX> might have concentrated
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those</TIMEX>.  He did to some extent, (though deasil
was not in, so I sought in vain under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shadow</ENAMEX> for
antiscian , which is about as obscure as one can get.
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">other day</TIMEX> I had a letter from someone who
wanted to know the name for the accent over the r
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">DvoÅ™ak</ENAMEX> , which happens to be among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> things I know.  As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welsh</ENAMEX>'s book has a list under
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRONUNCIATION</ENAMEX>, I looked there, to no avail.  (It is
called a haÄek or hachek or haÄek , pronounced
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HOTchek</ENAMEX>.)

            I cannot find it in my heart to fault <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welsh</ENAMEX> for
his failure: he probably tried out his ideas on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>
who might well have been able to find what they
were looking for.  I am convinced that there is a way
to do this kind of thing, but a book is not it: the kind
of associative information required to find even the
simplest thing is likely to vary considerably from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>, depending on orientation, education,
age, and other factors; including a large variety of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> to access the same information would be very
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uneconomical</ENAMEX> in book form, especially when high-speed
computers with large memories are so readily
available.  The problem is less one of simple (!) lexicology
as one of information theory and psychology.
I might add artificial intelligence just to make it
harder, but why make the issue more confused than
it is already?  This book does not work for me.

            Punching the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clock</ENAMEX>
            This is the idiom book for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 to 12</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years of age</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Clarion</ENAMEX> is an imprint of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houghton Mifflin</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publishers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The American Heritage Dictionary</ENAMEX>
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AHD</ENAMEX>] , so there is some responsibility behind the
book.

            The illustrations are colorful (green and black,
to be specific) and invariably illustrate the literal
senses of idioms, which are by nature figurative: in
other words, the illustration for raise the roof shows
someone lifting the roof off a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>.  Get it?  Pretty
puerile stuff, you might say, but don't lose sight of
the fact that it is intended for puerÅ and puellÄs .

            Terban, who appears to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henny Youngman</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nephew (â</ENAMEX>€œTake this book--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Away!â€™</ENAMEX>) but could
scarcely be blamed for that, teaches at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grammar School</ENAMEX>, a prep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>.
According to the evidence offered, he has been using
materials like those in the book to teach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about idioms</TIMEX>.  I find it odd that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> need to be
taught about idioms, but that is another matter.

            If anyone from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AHD</ENAMEX> had a look at
this material I should be disappointed, for there are
some ambiguities.  For instance, (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">28</NUMEX>) throwing her
hat into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ring</ENAMEX> has: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">â€œIn America</ENAMEX> in the early
1800s, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> challenged another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> by throwing
his hat into a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring</ENAMEX>.â€™  What ring?  What <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ring</ENAMEX>?  If
a boxing ring, why not say so?  (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">47</NUMEX>) batting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX>:
â€œBaseball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> have batting averages based
on the number of times they hit the ball when
they're up at bat.â€™  It seems to me that if you are
going to explain something, explain it all: doesn't hit
require the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">modifier â€œsafelyâ€™</ENAMEX>?  And how is thousand
explained?  If an average is the total number of times
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">batter</ENAMEX> hits a ball safely divided by the number of
times he is at bat, even if he gets a hit each time, that
average is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>, and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> might need an
explanation.  (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">51</NUMEX>) punch the clock: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œSome business
have time clocks by their front door.â€™  Do they?

            I am being pedantic and hypercritical, but it
does seem that a book of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 63</NUMEX> pages could have
been done a little more carefully.  the book is pleasant
enough, would certainly not do any harm, and
might very well encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> to think about
language.

            I am writing primarily to correct and update
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benedict Kimmelman</ENAMEX>'s article on the eff-word
[XVI<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX>].

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">â€œpopular British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">film</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, with

            In reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benedict Kimmelman</ENAMEX>'s article,
I should like to submit a polite euphemism in frequent
use.

            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> try to push ahead of a queue at a
bus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stop</ENAMEX> or in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>, one would politely say to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, â€œGet in the far queue.â€™

            There is also the famous story of the Fukawi
Pygmy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX> who frequently got lost in the jungles of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX>; in order to ascertain their whereabouts, they
would stand on another's shoulders to peer over the
long grass, crying, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œWhere the Fukawi?â</ENAMEX>€™





         
         


            Having been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> for interminable years
(and thus having been forced to memorize a great
many quite useless facts), I enjoyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Hirschberg</ENAMEX>'s
â€œLest We Forget.â€™  He is right in saying that
the mnemonic he lists for pi is cumbersome.  The one
I have always used seems easier to remember than
either his version or the numbers themselves and is
certainly less tortuous.  It works as his does, coding
digits by word lengths:


Sir, I send a rhyme excelling

In sacred truth and rigid spelling.

Numerical sprites elucidate

For me the lexicon's dull weight.

            

            I have no idea who wrote this version, which I
picked up from other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> as an undergraduate
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice University</ENAMEX>.





         
         


            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Hirschberg</ENAMEX>'s essay brought back to
mind a number of mnemonics from my college days
as a chemistry major.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chemists</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, are
faced with learning long lists of things, in our case
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trivial</ENAMEX> (that is, not systematic) nomenclature for various
homologous series of chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX>.  In
most cases there is little in the structures of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compounds</ENAMEX> to hang a name on, since many of the
names derive from the natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> from which
the compounds were isolated.

            We remembered the trivial names from the first
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> linear dicarboxylic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> ( oxalic, malonic, succinic,
glutaric, adipic, pimelic, suberic, azelaic, sebacic )
with the initialized mnemonic, â€œOh, my sweet
green apple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pie</ENAMEX> sounds absolutely swell.â€™

            There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> possible arrangements of the
hydrogen and hydroxy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of a
simple, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six-carbon</NUMEX> sugar molecule.  To remember
these, we had, â€œAll altruists gladly make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gum</ENAMEX> in gallon
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX>,â€™ yielding allose, altrose, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, maltose,
gulose, idose, galactose, talose .  This mnemonic also
yields the correct structures, if one can manage to
remember the proper alternations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fischer</ENAMEX>
projections used to represent their configurations in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> dimensions.

            A different kind of mnemonic is used for remembering
the difference between stalagmites and
stalactites : <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œMites grow up.â€™





         
         


            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> items caught my eye in a recent number
[XVI<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX>].  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Bricklin</ENAMEX>'s attribution to
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> â€œGeorges Louisâ€™ of the observation that â€œStyle
is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> himselfâ€™ (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 18</ENAMEX>).  Now, it may just be that
someone by that name--a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Frenchman</ENAMEX>, one would
gather from the spelling <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œGeorgesâ€™</ENAMEX>--uttered those
words or foreign equivalents thereof.  But I think it
more than likely that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bricklin</ENAMEX> is referring to the
famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">naturalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Georges-Louis Leclere</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">count de Buffon</ENAMEX>, better known to literary history
simply as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œBuffon</ENAMEX>.â€™  The oft-quoted citation is from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Discours sur le</ENAMEX> style , his acceptance speech delivered
before the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">AcadÃ©mie FranÃ§caise</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 1753</TIMEX>.  As here, it is usually wrenched a little out
of context.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buffon</ENAMEX> did not mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> paints an
autobiographical portrait by his style.  Rather, that of
all the things an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> might describe, all are extraneous
to him except for his style, which is his alone,
and hence his only possible passport to literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immortality</ENAMEX>:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">quantitÃ© des connaissances</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la singularitÃ© des</ENAMEX>

[The number of things known, the curiosity of the

certain guarantors of immortality....  These
things are outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, while style is man

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> item, on a lighter note, is one of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel P. Richard</ENAMEX>'s homophonic epigrams: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œI</ENAMEX> regret
that I have but one asterisk for my countryâ€™ (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p.22</ENAMEX>).
It reminded me of a little jingle that I read <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>
in some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> (alleged) humor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> and
which I rescue here from a well-earned oblivion:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> had a little plane

Now wasn't she a silly girl
Her little *!?
            





         
         
            Needless to Say



            It goes without saying that the duty of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> is
to explain.  In the modern world, there's no denying
that everything can in fact be explained.  The
best prose, therefore, is prose that imposes order.
Thus are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> made secure, and, more important,
thus is life made simple.  Nothing, it is clear, could be
more self-evident.

            Yet some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> strive instead for eloquence.
That is, they try to produce memorable work.  But
they do so, unfortunately, at the risk of confusing
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>.  To start with, their writing is often
rhetorical or even evocative.  It contains statements,
consequently, that allow varying interpretations; inevitably,
anything that affects a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>'s feelings is
bound to produce an unpredictable response.  Furthermore,
such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> at times resort to humour.  Accordingly,
they display cynicism, or alas, lead the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reader</ENAMEX> into ambiguity and paradox.  Worst of all,
these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> sometimes will communicate surprise
or wonder.  The result is to arouse a sense of mystery.
In sum, the effect of such writing is to portray
human existence as something vague and complex.
More than that, it can actually complicate matters
further.  On top of all this, we have the unhappy fact
that eloquent writing is indeed sometimes memorable,
compounding the problem.

            In contrast, the effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">communicator</TIMEX> creates
certainty.  He or she does this, it is evident, in two
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX>.  First, he rules out irrelevant or erroneous
thoughts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, he continually supplies
answers.  In short, he maintains command, investing
his exposition with all the authority that he
can muster.

            The goal, then, is omniscience.  Admittedly,
most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> are in reality not omniscient.  Not yet,
at any rate.  But nevertheless, it is within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>
of any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> to make a definitive statement on
a specific point.  This, surely, is sufficient.  After all,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">omniscience</ENAMEX> can be cumulative.  Over time, manifestly,
a multiplicity of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">omnisciences</ENAMEX> will add
up to total omniscience.  It is as if in recognition of
this, perforce, that increasing numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> are
looking for a way to produce airtight, irrefutable
prose.  And it is no accident that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language
provides just such a method.  I refer, of
course, to syllothetics.

            The syllothetic system had its origins, no doubt,
in the rule followed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of university
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monographs</ENAMEX> and government position papers.  To
wit: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> tell them what you are going to say, then
tell them what you are saying, and finally tell them
what you have said.  A sound practice, unquestionably.
But it was observed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> could be effectively
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> sentence by sentence.  That is to say,
the meaning of a sentence could be signaled--and
thereby validated--by the use of a sentence adverb
such as moreover, indeed , or however .  Essentially,
the thrust of the sentence was communicated in advance.
In this way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> knew what a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> was
going to say before he said it.  In a sense, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>
said it themselves.

            To be sure, the technique of qualifying sentences
with modifiers is nothing new.  For instance,
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> had sorted out their expository works
with such expressions as incidentally, on one hand ,
and for example .  In addition, others had followed
the practice of enumerating their sentences with
first, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> , or next, then , and finally , or
all of these.  More noteworthy, some had reinforced
their statements with, on the one hand, such key
words as significantly, symbolically , and thankfully ,
or, on the other hand, such indispensables as unfortunately,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unhappily</ENAMEX> , and alas .  Most significantly, it
should be noted, many had gone so far as to advance
statements in the form of a premise or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given</TIMEX>, e.g.,
it need hardly be stated, obviously , and of course of
course .

            Be that as it may, the foundations of modern
syllothetics were cemented, as we now know, with
the systematic use of but at the beginnings of sentences.
There can be no doubt whatever that with
this development logical exposition could thereby
become relentless.  It was discovered--and this
should no longer be any cause for wonder--that a
sentence containing however could also begin with
but .  Moreover, but could appear directly in front of
nevertheless .  But this development reached its zenith
with the use of but as a topper conjunction (see
the beginning of this sentence); the topper but does
not in reality indicate a contradiction, for it always
appears at the start of a sentence which is, truth be,
in harmony with preceding sentences, but rather it
tops the previous statements by pointing unerringly
to that which is promised by contradiction, namely
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">illumination</ENAMEX>.  Let's be frank.  It was the logical force
of but , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, that began to supply the dynamism
of syllothetics, enabling it to combine, as it
does, the undeniable energy of the syllogism with
the indisputable power of the theorem.

            In consequence we have, in syllothetics, a veritable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arsenal</ENAMEX> of instruments that serve to produce
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coherence</ENAMEX> and logic in modern prose.  For example,
there is not only affirmation by demonstration (ergo,
hence, therefore, accordingly , but there is also documentation
by postulation (it can be assumed, we can
suppose) and also validation by synthesization (basically,
in truth, in a very real sense) as well as verification
by substitution (that is to say, in other words, in
short) .  Similarly, there is not only confutation by disputation
(on the contrary, notwithstanding, however,
nevertheless) , but there is also negation by concession
(despite, although, allowing that) and also, not
least, refutation by capitulation (it might be argued,
it would be easy to conclude) .

            Syllothetics, it can be seen, is inexorable.  Either
we have corroboration by escalation (moreover, on
top of that, above all) , or we have devaluation by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">declination</ENAMEX> (worse, worse still, worst of all) .  On one
hand we have substantiation by association (similarly,
in the same way) ; on the other hand we have
invalidation by differentiation (quite a different matter,
we cannot compare, something else again) .

            It is hardly necessary to add that syllothetics
possesses the capacity to transcend logic.  Who can
deny it?  We have, happily, induction by intuition,
the inference that goes beyond mere fact (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> cannot
avoid the suspicion, it is difficult to shake off the conviction) ,
and also, thanks be, attestation by clarification,
the proof that is superior to mere evidence
(even so, still, in any event) .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plainly</ENAMEX>, we are in the
presence here of higher truths: look at ratification
by approximation (for the most part, as it were,
broadly speaking) ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> the revelation of amplification
(conceivably, it may even be, it would not be
too much to say) .

            This brings us, willy-nilly, to the infinite utility
of syllothetics.  It is a system, broadly speaking, that
is impervious to criticism.  Certainly it is no passing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fad</ENAMEX>, dependent on vogue words, for despite its infancy
it employs such age-old terms as alas, albeit,
perforce , and withal .  Nor it can be taxed with pedantry,
demonstrably, for on occasion it makes use of
colloquial expressions like for starters, likewise, for
sure , and no doubt about it .  Above all, though some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> might think otherwise, it definitely does not
involve clichÃ©s.  On the contrary.  For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing, a
clichÃ© can be defined as an imaginative expression
which through repetition has lost its imaginativeness.
But syllothetics, in contradistinction, shuns the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">imaginations</ENAMEX> altogether.  More to the point, syllothetics
deploys a vocabulary of unparalleled variety.  In
fact there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">well over one hundred</NUMEX> syllothetic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modifiers</ENAMEX>.  And what is more, additional ones are
coming into use <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>.  Hence the recent discovery,
by some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, that it is possible to syllothesize
every sentence.

            It is true that there are rational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, seemingly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">logical</ENAMEX>, who make little or no use of syllothetics.
They feel, it would seem, that coherence can be
obtained without it.  They would say, undoubtedly,
that one sentence follows another.  But the question
is, how closely?  In syllothetics, it must be pointed
out, an expression such as naturally or in other
words not only introduces a sentence but also refers
to the previous one.  The effect is that at every step
syllotheticians have their feet in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two</TIMEX> sentences, as it
were.  And by looking backward at all times, it need
hardly be added, they appear to be going nowhere
of interest.  Naturally, nothing is more reassuring to
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>.  Nothing, in other words, is more conducive
to acquiesence.

            It can be argued, you will object, that such a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> is slow, and that, concommitantly, very
little is being said.  But this objection, however,
misses the point.  True, syllotheticians aim high; in a
word, they seek not merely to persuade but to convince.
Still, the fact that their goals are essentially
modest.  Let it be remembered that they make no
declarations.  They restrict themselves to deductions,
basing them on references, citations, or precedents,
which is a different matter altogether.  They
may, perhaps, list variables, or, on occasion, identify
options; at most, they will establish parameters.  But,
it must be emphasized, they do not express anything.
They articulate, which is something else
again.  Nor, what is more, do they ever describe.
They delineate, which is something entirely different.
So it should come as no surprise to be told that,
basically, syllotheticians are at bottom unconcerned
about how little they might have to say.

            It would not be too much to say that it does not
at all matter what may or may not be contained in
syllothetic sentences.  The content lies, rather, in the
articulation of the logical relationships between
them.  But make no mistake about it, that is enough.
For, clearly, although it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>'s duty to explain,
the very fact that everything must be explained
means, indisputably, that in due course everything
will in fact be explained.  Ergo, the less said
the better.

            Already, it is becoming very difficult to deny--
all available evidence points to it--that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> is
surely coming, withal, when there will remain, truly,
no mere coincidences about which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> cannot avoid
a suspicion or shake off a conviction, when clearly
everything will incontrovertibly support a thesis or
conversely stand in direct contrast to it, and, overriding
all this, there will as a result be not the slightest
doubt in our minds about one inescapable conclusion,
namely the dawning realization that, there
being nothing more to say on the subject, as it were,
we therefore will no longer hesitate but rather will
necessarily feel compelled to state the obvious.  Indeed,
we would be remiss in our duty if we failed to
mention it.  Needless to say.

quotations make up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">166</NUMEX> pages you ask?  Well, the
quotations actually make up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">134</NUMEX> pages, with pages
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">137</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">155</NUMEX> devoted to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Authors</ENAMEX>' Index, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">157</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">163</NUMEX> to

contains an alphabetical listing of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">191</NUMEX> categories.

            Language <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Maven Strikes Again</ENAMEX>
            It is probably safe to say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Safire</ENAMEX> is the
most prolific of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX>;
it is very likely true that he is the most prolific
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> on language in general.  His articles, â€œOn
Language,â€™ have appeared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> (except when he
was taking a holiday) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York Times Magazine</ENAMEX>
since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>.  As <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> language buffs
know--even those who do not take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York</ENAMEX>
Times --he is a fearless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentator</ENAMEX> on every aspect
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> who has gathered behind him not
only an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> of admires but a cadre of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX>,
dubbed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œthe Lexicographic Irregulars</ENAMEX>,â€™ who send
him citations, comments, and queries.  I call him
â€œBillâ€™ partly because most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do and partly because
we have known each other since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1967</TIMEX>
when his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New Language of Politics</ENAMEX> was edited under
my direction at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>.  Although he is not a
professional linguist, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> knows a great deal about
language and, notwithstanding some of the comments
he makes in his column, is very sensitive to it.
He is a very good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, too, though I sometimes
find his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX> approach unnecessary and a bit annoying:
he seems in a perpetual pursuit of the pun, an
affliction not entirely unknown in these hallowed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">halls</ENAMEX>.  However, I have the same criticism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard</ENAMEX>'s commentaries on language published,
from time to time, in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> and, formerly, in
these pages, and I can only attribute attrition among
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> to that and other weaknesses
in myself.

            Because of the enormous variety of the pieces
collected here, the anthology is virtually impossible
to review.  It doesn't, of course, deal with every aspect
of language, but it does cover a very broad
spectrum.  In fact, anyone who pretends to have an
interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> and who has a library of worthwhile
works on the subject must have all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safire</ENAMEX>'s

Advice , which he wrote with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leonard</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safir</ENAMEX>.  The indexes are quite good, though not as exhaustive
as one might have wished; yet one is likely
to find what he is looking for without difficulty.
Moreover, the books are attractively set out, which
adds to their readability.  Even the title design is
clever: it is shown on the jacket (over his photo,
which the wretch clearly got his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> to pose for),
cover, and title page as,

            It is a pity that the articles are not provided with
the dates of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>, though it is not difficult
to understand why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> might be reluctant
to do so.  Yet, when I read that a subscription
to VERBATIM costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10.00</NUMEX>, while I am grateful for
the plug, I realize that the piece must have appeared
quite some time ago.  A certain amount of updating
might be in order, perhaps by enclosing in square
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">brackets</TIMEX> subscription rates in effect at the time of
publication of the book.  Occasionally wrong, not
only is Bill not reluctant to admit his errors, he may
be one of the few who literally profited from their
mistakes by compiling a book containing many of
them: called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">I Stand Corrected</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times Books</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>),
it actually contains other matter, too.

            To a subject that is treated in the most turgid
fashion by linguists and with unusually irresponsible
scholarship by many other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Safire</ENAMEX>
brings just the right, literate, human touch, often
funny, ever lively, and always friendly, informative,
and entertaining.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Power</ENAMEX> and the Word
            In his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Preface</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> offers, â€œMy purpose in
writing this book is quite simple: to draw together
and make accessible some of the academic and other
reading that I have done in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</TIMEX>.â€™  In
this aim, he has succeeded quite admirably, though
one might be given to wonder what, if anything, he
reads for amusement.  There are many extremely abstruse
notions in linguistics, and if any one might find
useful a brief summarization [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ] of many of the linguistic
philosophies of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 150 years</TIMEX>, this is a
convenient, minimalist approach.  I say â€œminimalistâ€™
because the ideas are watered down, then doubledistilled,
then compressed, then encapsulated.  Because
linguists are atrociously bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, in most
cases, this would be a merciful deliverance from the
agony of wading through their texts at first hand
were it not for the unfortunate fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersen</ENAMEX> is
a pretty boring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> himself.  Also, it would have
been useful (and not necessarily munificent) to have
provided such a book with a reasonably replete index.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, that is also a barebones affair.  I was unable
to find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wittgenstein</ENAMEX> in the Index, but I would
not lay odds on his having been omitted from the
text.

            The book is uneven, here summarizing an important
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scholar</ENAMEX>'s work in a paragraph or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, there
devoting one entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and
another to black <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, both rather disproportionately
trivial in the general scheme of linguistic theory.
Missing is coverage of more important areas of
linguistics, like computational linguistics, mechanical
translation, lexicography, language analysis by
computer, and some others.  But that may merely be
reflective of my own interests, or does not reflect
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s readings, or, probably, both.  Well, one
cannot have everything, and, as I sometimes maintain
but rarely believe, a book should be reviewed
for what it contains and not condemned for what it
omits.

            If you are a professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguist</ENAMEX>, you can pass
this one by, unless you teach and need a crib for
your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>.  If you are a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> of linguistics (in
any sense of the term), you might find it convenient
to have this book to save your running to the multivolume
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encyclopedia</ENAMEX> or the original text (if you have
it) in order to see what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. F. Skinner</ENAMEX> and Noam
Chomsky were on about.  Had it been more complete
and better done, the book might have served
as a survey text for linguistics, a work that is sorely
needed.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguists</ENAMEX> who write books seem invariably
to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> who are touting their own points
of view, some of which are recondite, to say the
least.  Surely there must be a teaching linguist out
there, somewhere, capable of putting together a cogent,
readable text that discusses not only the field
of linguistics but its various theories and their interrelations.
Unfortunately, there has not been a good
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">bookwriting</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguist</ENAMEX> who was also a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> of
expository prose since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otto Jespersen</ENAMEX>, the Santayana
of linguistics, and he died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX>.

            I admire <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Hirschberg</ENAMEX>'s mnemonic tricks
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>], but he has left out an important postscript
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ogden Nash</ENAMEX> poem about the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>- I lama and
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-l llama .  When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nash</ENAMEX> gets to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>- l
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lllama</ENAMEX> and concludes there isn't any, he amends
himself in a footnote: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œThe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s attention has
been called to a type of conflagration known as the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-alarmer .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pooh</ENAMEX>.â€™  I suppose this just supports an
old adage: footnotes are forgettable.





         
         


            I have recently met <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> phrases that I cannot
find in the sort of reference books that might be expected
to define them if they are, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> I was
reading implied, recognized political or economic
terms.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, sobornostic collectivism , is said to
refer to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leninist</ENAMEX> school of thought; the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>,
agathistic distributism , is called â€œa theory of economic
nationalism.â€™

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sobornost</ENAMEX> is a word used by some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian Orthodox</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">theologians</ENAMEX>, and there is, or was, a philosophic
position called agathism .  (The curious are directed
to OED2.)  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collectivism</ENAMEX> is part of the common
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vocabulary</ENAMEX> now, and distributism was a movement
that enjoyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chesterton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belloc</ENAMEX> as its chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX>.
I am however, unable to see much meaning
in those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-word phrases.  Can any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>
offer information about them?




         
         



            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> often ask me how they can â€œimproveâ€™
their vocabularies and what books I can recommend
as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aids</ENAMEX>.  My invariable reply is that the only genuine
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to increase one's vocabulary is by reading, reading,
reading.  It may not be an immediately obvious
fact, but it is significant that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who ask the
question--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strangers</ENAMEX>, who telephone me--are quite
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">articulate</ENAMEX>, from which I deduce that one must have
reached some proficiency in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> before becoming
aware that there might be some <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX>.
I can get by in a couple of other languages, chiefly in
reading, not speaking them, but feel that I cannot
afford the time to improved my control of other languages
at the expense of my continuing efforts to
learn what I can about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>.  That is, of course, a
purely personal view and should under no circumstances
be construed as an adverse comment on the
study of foreign languages.  But there is a difference
between learning about them and trying to gain fluency
in them: I think I know a fair amount about
many languages in which I have no speaking or writing
ability; however rewarding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fluency</ENAMEX> in them
might be for aesthetic reasons (to read their literature,
for example), one has just so much time...;
those who need them for practical reasons, should
not be deterred or discouraged by these remarks,
nor should those who wish to study them for any
other reason.  The study and acquisition of foreign
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">languages</ENAMEX>, living and dead, is both intellectually and
practically rewarding.  By the time I graduated from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">college</ENAMEX>, I had studied <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> and Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> for
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lithuanian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanskrit</ENAMEX> for one, and had established
a passing acquaintance with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norwegian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX>.
I can get by in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> (after I have spoken it for
several <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>), but I do not speak much <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>,
partly, perhaps, because of the paucity of conversational
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">companions</ENAMEX>.  I bring this up not to vaunt any
great accomplishments but to emphasize that I am
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to encourage the study of foreign languages.
I simply draw the line between studying
them and learning them: learning a foreign language
is extremely difficult, and most of those who are
truly fluent in a second <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> have been brought
up in bilingual (or, sometimes, trilingual) situations.

            I raise the matter of foreign languages in connection
with vocabulary partly because familiarity
with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> is
particularly useful in establishing an intimate relationship
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language.  I have often
been told that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> is a difficult language to learn,
but, as a native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>, I have no personal opinion
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> that.  I do know, however, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who
acquired English relatively late in life and whom I
consider to have a better command of the medium
than most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native speakers</ENAMEX>.  That <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is an exception;
indeed, she has a younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> who acquired
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> at the same time who has difficulty expressing
herself.  These examples may serve to confirm
what we all already suspect, that there is a spectrum
of natural ability for language, with the gifted at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
end--presumably, our poets, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, and so forth--and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">less gifted</ENAMEX> at
the other.  The former possess <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SprachgefÃ</ENAMEX>¼hl `a sensitivity
for language; language sense'; from among the
latter I exclude pathological cases.  In that connection
I am constrained to express my skepticism about
the accuracy and wisdom of diagnosing everyone
who has difficulty learning to read and write as being
afflicted with dyslexia: learning is sometimes difficult--I
had terrible trouble with history when I was
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>--and it is wrong to attribute a large percentage
of failures and difficulties to some disorder
rather than to the (possible) failings of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> or,
more often, to a simple lack of interest and motivation
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>.

            Fortunate are those who have been raised in a
reading household or have acquired a thirst and opportunity
for reading early in life.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fortunate</ENAMEX>, too,
are those who were given the opportunities of being
exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> who were not too busy or lazy
to assign weekly essays and to mark them for style as
well as for grammar and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>.  For the manipulation
of language as an art one must first view it as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">craft</ENAMEX>, and the acquisition of any craft cannot be accomplished
without effort: one does not become a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> by sitting around thinking about it or by saying
he is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> when someone asks, â€œWhat do you
do?â€™; one is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> by virtue of the fact that he
writes, with no regard whatsoever to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>.

            In this connection, it is not the quantity of vocabulary
that marks a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> but the quality.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ask me about increasing their vocabularies,
often suggest that they read The Growth of the
Soil , by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knut Hamsun</ENAMEX>.  Hamsun, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norwegian</ENAMEX>, won
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX> prize in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1920</TIMEX> and is seldom talked about
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>, though, as far as I am aware, his books
are in print; in any event, they are available from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamsun</ENAMEX> wrote in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norwegian</ENAMEX>, of course; I do
not know who translated Growth in the edition in
which I originally read it (which I think was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library</ENAMEX>), but as a teenager I was terribly impressed
by the writing.  The story is unimportant--some bucolic
tale--but the writing is extraordinary, and I
must assume that while the art of the original remains,
no small credit is due to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX>.  What
makes this book such an exemplary piece of work is
that I doubt it contains many words of more than
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> syllable (so to speak).  It is consequently a model
of clarity as well as of simplicity and an abiding lesson
to all who think that increasing their vocabularies
will make them more articulate.

            It is interesting to note that one of the most successful
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vocabulary</ENAMEX> books bears the title, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">It Pays to</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Increase Your Word Power</ENAMEX> , that is, not something
like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œIt Pays to Increase Your Vocabulary</ENAMEX>.â€™  In other
words, memorizing a slew of arcane, recondite sesquipedalianisms
is not what gives <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> the edge, it is
knowing how to use the language one already possesses.
â€œUse a word <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times and it is yoursâ€™ is a
slogan that is occasionally seen blazoned across mail-order
advertising.  It conjures up the picture of
someone boning up on his â€œword for the dayâ€™ just
before attending a cocktail party and then awkwardly
trying to steer the conversation in such a way
that he can insert a word like paradigm, paragon , or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX> .

            Those who wish to sharpen their language skills
are best advised to read and write, and to do both as
much as possible, perhaps trying to emulate an admired
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>.  If it is felt that some guidance is
needed, then they should hire a tutor--there ought
to be plenty of good ones available everywhere.  Attending
writing classes is a possible alternative, but
those vary so in quality as well as purpose that an
individual's needs might not be met.  Finally, they
should not view <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> as their tutors, submitting
their writings in the hope of critique: however good
they might be as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>, they are not necessarily
good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> and are usually focused very specifically
on the demands of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>.
