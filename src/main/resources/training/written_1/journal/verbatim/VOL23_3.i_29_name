            According to the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linguist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otto</ENAMEX>
Jespersen, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> theories to account for
the origin of language: the bow-wow theory, in
which speech imitated animal calls; the pooh-pooh
theory, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> made instinctive sounds
through physical or emotional reactions; the dingdong
theory, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> reacted to the environment;
the yo-he-ho theory, in which people
spoke when working together; and the la-la theory,
in which speech arose from the romantic side of life.

            If bird names are anything to go by, the bowwow
theory (perhaps we should call it the tweet-tweet
theory) rules the roost, since many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> are
named for their songs or calls.  This even holds for the
generic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cock</ENAMEX>, hen, and chick .  The farmyard cock is so
called for its clucks, as illustrated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaucer</ENAMEX> in The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nun</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Priest's Tale</ENAMEX>, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chanticleer</ENAMEX> cryde anon,
cok, cok.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cockerel</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cock-a-doodle-doo</ENAMEX> is an
extension of this, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cock</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crow</ENAMEX>.  The hen is so called
for her singing, with a name related to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> canere
to sing, and so to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> chant .  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chanticleer</ENAMEX>, though
male, has a name meaning one who sings clearly.)
The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> has a name related to that of the cock ,
with its changed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vowel</ENAMEX> representing its less powerful
cry.  The chick , as a young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>, is named from it.

            Outside the farmyard, but still (usually) within
farmland territory, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crow</ENAMEX> and rook are both named
for their harsh call or caw , and though less common,
the chough and the raven are similarly named.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chough</ENAMEX>'s cry has been described 
as kyaw , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">raven</ENAMEX>'s as prruk (suggesting the name of the physically
related rook ).  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corncrake</ENAMEX>'s cry has been verbalized
as crex , which adequately represents the crake that is
the basic form of the name.

            Elsewhere afield, the curlew , with its cry of courli ,
is obviously named, as is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cuckoo</ENAMEX> , whose name is
similar in many languages (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> coucou , German
Kuckuck , <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> kokkux , <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> cuculus ).  The first
part of its name is in fact directly related to that of the
cock , as the initial cuck - of its call corresponds to the
farmyard <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>'s cluck.

            
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jackdaw</ENAMEX> also belongs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crow</ENAMEX> family
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corvidae</ENAMEX> ), and daw represents its chak .  (It does it
better in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, where the bird is a taccola ,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from earlier</TIMEX> tacca .)  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part of its name is

            the personal name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX> .  The sparrow does not itself
have an imitative name, although it was formerly nicknamed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip</ENAMEX> , for its rapid twittering and chirping
notes.  Hence <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Skelton</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 16th-century</TIMEX> poem
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phyllyp Sparowe</ENAMEX> , a lament by a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> for her pet
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sparrow</ENAMEX> killed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>, with the affecting lines:
Nothynge it auayled/To call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phylyp</ENAMEX> agayne,<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/Whom</ENAMEX>
Gyb our <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat hath slayne</ENAMEX>.

            Another bird with an imitative name prefixed by
a personal name is the magpie .  Here pie is related to
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> pipere to chirp.  There are other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pi -</ENAMEX> or its equivalent in their names similarly, such as
the peewit, pipit , and even the pigeon .  True, pigeons
coo , but the bird derives its name from the onomatopoeic
base pip - that imitates the chirp of a young
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bird</ENAMEX> (and that also gave <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipe</ENAMEX> ).  Hence also the
more obvious name of the sandpiper , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> that pipes
(or peeps ) on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sands</ENAMEX>.

            We are now by the seaside, where the gull has a
name representing its repeated kyow, kyow .  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seagull</ENAMEX> is also known as the mew , likewise an imitative
name.  Another aquatic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goose</ENAMEX> , whose name
represents its distinctive honk.  The male of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, the gander , has a directly related name, as
does the gannet .  Its cry is described as a barking
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrah</ENAMEX> .  Still with the water <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, the heron is named
for its harsh cry rrank; the name itself is related to
that of the hen .  The bittern is a further wading <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>;
its cry is usually described as a boom, and the first
part of its name, from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> butio , represents this.
Yet another water dweller is the garganey , a kind of
duck.  Its name represents its distinctive quacking.

            On dry land, the finch is named for its prolonged
nasal tswe<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-e-e</ENAMEX> , mostly clearly heard in the greenfinch.
The siskin is in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and has a similar
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nameâ€”and</ENAMEX> indeed a similar call.  A harsher note is
sounded by the shrike , whose name is related to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">screech</ENAMEX> and shriek .  The quail is so called not because
it is timid but because the call of the female is a double
note queep, queep .  The quail is a gamebird, as is
the partridge .  Its own name is equally imitative, not
of its voice but of the sharp whirring sound made by
its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wings</ENAMEX> when it suddenly flies up.  This sounds like
a fart , a related word.  (Compare <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> perdix partridge.
and perdesthai to break wind.)  Quite a different
sound is made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">owl</ENAMEX>, whose name represents
its familiar hoot, otherwise the final, longer
note of its conventional call <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tu-whit tu-whoo</NUMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">howl</ENAMEX> is a related word.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hibou</ENAMEX> also imitates the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bird</ENAMEX>'s call, as does its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eule</ENAMEX> , a diminutive
form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uhu</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">eagle owl</ENAMEX>.

            Even the little wren has an echoic name, as much
more obviously does the chiffchaff , although its chiffs
and chaffs are usually repeated in irregular order, such
as chiff, chiff, chiff, chaff, chiff, chaff .  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rarer bird</ENAMEX>, but
also with an obviously onomatopoeic name, is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hoopoe</ENAMEX> .  Its far-carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">poo-poo-poo</ENAMEX> is also represened
in its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> name, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upupa</ENAMEX> epops .  Its name
evokes the equally exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bobolink</ENAMEX>, bulbul and whippoorwill ,
with their clearly echoic names.  The last
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bird</ENAMEX> is an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nightjar</ENAMEX> , where jar is also an imitative
word, referring to its loud churring cry.  ( Churr
and jar are related words.)  The nightingale does not
have a directly imitative name, although the final- gale
is related to yell , which is undoubtedly echoic.

            It is tempting to relate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">yellowhammer</ENAMEX>'s name
to yammer (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> jammern ), referring to its fussy
call, a rapid chi-chi-chi-chi-chi... chweee , traditionally
rendered little<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-bit-</NUMEX>of-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>-and-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>.  But the
origin of the name is disputed.  (The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part of the
name indicates the colour of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and underparts.)

            Finally in this bouquet of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> names, let us
savour the rail , whose repeated gep, gep, gep and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groaning</ENAMEX> and grunting notes suggest a death rattle , a
related word.  They order things more neatly in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> here, for rÃ¢le is both the name of the bird
and the word for this agonized and agonizing sound.

               Vale!
            

            The time has come, as it does to all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, animate
and inanimate, to say goodby.  This issue,
Volume XXIII, Number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Winter 1997</ENAMEX>], will be the
last published and edited under our aegis.

            It has, as they say, been a good run.  There have
been ups (like the time when we had a mailing service
that kept adding new and renewing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX>' names
and addresses without removing the old ones, leading
us not only into a state of euphoria contemplating our
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> paid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> but, at the same time, into
near bankruptcy paying the attendent increased printing
and postage costs without the expected revenues);
and, of course, there have been downs (like falling
behind so far in the publishing schedule that we
changed the dates of the issues from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Summer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Autumn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winter</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spring</ENAMEX> (as in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Of Thee I Sing</ENAMEX>! ), and the dismay and disappointment
at the down-marketing of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorker</ENAMEX> , once a stalwartâ€”if expensiveâ€”source of new
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX>, nowâ€”still expensiveâ€”catering to the
pretentious philistine market).

            Present <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> might be surprised to learn
that the initial rate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>'s subscription was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.50</NUMEX>
and that copies were sent out via first-class mail.  It
must be said, though, that those <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> issues ran to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> pages compared with the current <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty-four</TIMEX>
(or, sometimes, more).  Being rather indolent in
money matters, we have never been aggressive in pursuing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX>; but the frequent return and regular
orders from some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> reflected some satisfaction
with the results sought.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of our proudest moments came when, upon
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> loading into our computer the CD-ROM of the
Second <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX> , we
discovered that it contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">121</NUMEX> quotations from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>.  We were pleased, too, when, several years
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>, we were able to pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX>, a rare occurrence
in the loftier realms of noncommercial publishing.
Also, many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">periodicals</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reader's Digest</ENAMEX>
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> of lesser circulation, have reprinted articles
from VERBATIM.

            With the rarest exceptions, those who wrote to us
seeking information, offering comment or criticismâ€”
and there have been many, from everywhere in the
worldâ€”treated us with kindness and respect, even
when they caught us in the most embarrassing errors.
We have enjoyed chatting with those who have telephoned,
and we haveâ€”without fail, we thinkâ€”sent
written replies to all who have written (with the exception
of those who sent publishable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPISTOLAE</ENAMEX>).
Lately, we have been remiss only in writing discouraging
letters to job <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX>, because virtually all
have written merely to a name and address found in
a list of book or periodical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>.

            Our book publishing activities have not shaken
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> beneath our or anyone else's feet: our bestseller
by far has been the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-volume <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grammar</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George O. Curme</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> printings),
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Lederer</ENAMEX>'s Colonial American
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> a close <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> printings).  Other books,
which I still believe to be good ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Word for Word</ENAMEX> , by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward C. Pinkerton</ENAMEX>), amusing ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wordsmanship</ENAMEX> , by
ClaurÃ¨ne duGran, a thinly disguised anagram of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Urdang</ENAMEX>), and useful ( <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Verbatim Volumes I-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>
and the Index thereto, altogether <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> books), have
not fared so well: indeed, a substantial portion of the
stock at our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouse</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> consists of
Word for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Word and the Verbatim volumes</ENAMEX>.  Another
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Disaster</ENAMEX> (though it will probably go unnoticed
on any television series of that name) has been our offering
of VERBATIM binders: one must assume that the
back issues have ended up, along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roebuck</ENAMEX> catalogue, hanging from a nail in the privy.

            We found the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who knewâ€”or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">knowâ€”about VERBATIM</ENAMEX> to be astonishing: in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>,
among ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX>,
among linguists, among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> in general, most
knew of it; alas, they didn't subscribe.

            We, personally, shall miss the correspondence
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>;
and we shall miss the silent majority, those of you
who quietly continued to renew your subscriptions,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, occasionally dropping a line with a
complimentary remark.

            If we owned a green eyeshade, quill pen, and
cuff-protectors, we could tell you, with some sentiment,
that we are hanging them up.  We do not, and
you may be assured that if there is any reason to write
to us, we shall be about (either in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aylesbury</ENAMEX> or Old
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lyme</ENAMEX>), hence reasonably accessible to answer
your questions.

            Confusion results not only from using the wrong
word, but also from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinful Syntax</ENAMEX>.  In the sentence,
She loves music better than me , the syntax gives
the meaning She loves music better than she loves
me; but a majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, infected
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinful Syntax</ENAMEX>, will today understand the sentence
as She loves music better than I love it or ...better
than I do.  If that is really what was meant, then the
sentence should have been, She loves music better
than I .  Elementary!  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> would have said only a

            Not even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York Times</ENAMEX> , our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> of record,
is immune.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">caption</ENAMEX> beneath a photograph in the

in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brownsville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX>.
            

            Sometimes it is not the case that is wrong but the
pronoun itself: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> who; the people
which .  Even possessive pronouns present difficulty
for some.  My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and I's constant fear was ... said

many educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> misuse pronouns that others,
uncertain of what is correct, try to avoid one error by
committing another.  This, at any rate, would explain
the increasingly common for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> and myself and

            If meaning is to emerge without ambiguity from
a language like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, largely uninflected and having
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homonyms</ENAMEX> and homophones, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> must
be able to recognize not just the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Parts of Speech but</ENAMEX>
also those peripatetic words that wander from one
category to another.  All your work is undone .  Does
that mean no work was done or the work done was
destroyed?  In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maine Sunday Telegram</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1992</TIMEX>, an article about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hibernating</ENAMEX> bears
contained this sentence: I have seen some bears double
their size.  Is double verb or adjective?  Treating
adjectives as if they were nouns is a form of abuse
which has become common.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Painting for Posterity</ENAMEX>,
an article by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy Sutherland</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telegram</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Section E</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1996</TIMEX>,
there was this: [in a portrait] Too broad of a smile
could look maniacal, or like a smirk.

            Even when syntax is not sinful, meaning may be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">muddled</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Gleick</ENAMEX> in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> biography, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Genius</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Feynman</ENAMEX> , quoted the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> philosopher, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.V. Quine</ENAMEX>: I think that for scientific
purposes the best we can do is give up the notion
of knowledge as a bad job...  Did he mean
give up as a bad [useless, vain] job the notion of knowledge
[of the ability to know anything with precision] or
did he mean give up thinking that knowledge is a bad
[impossible] job?  In light of the context, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> interpretation
seemed more suitable to this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>.

            On page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harper</ENAMEX>'s , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1995</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathryn Harrison</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">What Remains</ENAMEX>, wrote:
Because most of us fear suffering so intensely...
Did she mean fear so intensely [all] suffering or
fear such intense suffering?  In the comic strip
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Valiant</ENAMEX> , whose captions are consistently well
written (and no wonder: their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Cullen</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX>), there was in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1996</TIMEX> sequence:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cormac</ENAMEX>'s arrival was watched... by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>'s most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populous inhabitants</ENAMEX>.  Perhaps the original was most
of the populous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> and was deformed
through some editorial glitchâ€”but even
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Homer</ENAMEX>, it is said, sometimes nodded.

            Stress may alter meaning in ways unforeseen by
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>.  On page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> August
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, there was this: I think it's what they used to call
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>.  Was it something for calling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> or the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>'s name?  On page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> of the same issue is the ambiguous
He disliked boring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Advertisers</ENAMEX>
often exploit the possibility of a double meaning or of
a pun which shifting stress can provide: A growing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">problem; Drink</ENAMEX> in the sun!; The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> you
keep.

            Other ambiguities occur when vernacular expressions
begin to invade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High English</ENAMEX>.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer Rooks</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31 January 1995</TIMEX>,
said, [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say they have no problem with
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Freeport</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>.  Because of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">faddish</ENAMEX> (and odious) No problem!, such a sentence
will soon meanâ€”even now will be understood by
many to meanâ€”that school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> do not disapprove
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>.

            And what of that little word, too?  I cannot
speak too highly of him.  It cannot be too long.
He's not too fond of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, is he?  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbott</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Costello</ENAMEX> could have wrung a good many laughs
from such sentences, as well as from one in an accident
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>: There was no one to help.  At first, the
meaning seemed to be no one to give help; but,
as the report continued and we learned that the victim
had walked away, the meaning changed to no
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to be helped.

            Meaning can be muddled in many ways.  Sense
is slippery.  It easily escapes the nets flung out by
words, even when they are straitened by rules of syntax
and by logic.  When the possibilities for misunderstanding
seem nearly as infinite as words
themselves, what a wondrous thing it is when words
and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>' intentions coincide.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Salty Sayings</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cornwall</ENAMEX>



            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornish</ENAMEX> way with words tends to be as salty as
their native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilchards</ENAMEX>.  Many old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sayings</ENAMEX> are
concerned with cutting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> down to size and
shrewd thrusts are meant to find their mark!

            The slow-witted are often described as, Like
Tregony <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bandâ€”three scats</ENAMEX> [beats] behind, or as
too slow to carry a cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dennar</ENAMEX> [dinner].  Stronger
still is the old gibe, Put in weth the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> and took
out weth the cakes, often muttered behind the deficient
one's back.  Any sign of putting on airs or assertiveness
is frowned upon, and one still hears crude
jokes like, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quietness</ENAMEX> is the best noise as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uncle</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny</ENAMEX> said when he knocked down his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, or
Dressed to death like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally Hatch</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mournful</ENAMEX> looks
were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crisply</ENAMEX> dismissed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Cornwall</ENAMEX> as looking
like a dying <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX> in a thunderstorm.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greed</ENAMEX>, too,
was discouraged with a terse reminder, You don't
need that any more than a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">toad</ENAMEX> needs side pockets.

            The famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornish</ENAMEX> pasties provide the saying,
As long as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan Bedella</ENAMEX>'s fiddle if a new young cook
makes a misshapen pasty.  For the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornish</ENAMEX> tend to be
rather a critical race owing to their struggle to make
ends meet in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> which has long known economic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hardship</ENAMEX>.  A hard-pressed life naturally tends to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blunt</ENAMEX> speech.

            Of a bandy-legged individual you will hear, He
couldn't stop a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> in a passage! and of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lank hair</ENAMEX>,
like a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> of pump <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.  Even a contented person
is often heard to say, Ah'm happy on me own dung
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heap</ENAMEX>, with typical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornish</ENAMEX> self-mockery.  Ask an
older inhabitant for his or her age and you may well
get the familiar reply, As old as my little finger and a
bit older than my teeth.  In a strong-minded county
like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cornwall</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> may be admired as being
as tough as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hancock</ENAMEX>'s motherâ€”an archetypal
dragon lady rooted in local history.

            Being a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Celtic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornish cleave</ENAMEX> naturally
to vivid descriptions.  Any sign of restlessness, for
instance, is summed up as, All of a motion like a
Mulfra <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">toad</ENAMEX> on a red hot shovel, and when shivering,
it is a case of cold as a quilkin [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">frog</ENAMEX>] or chilled to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">marra</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX>].  Although pushiness is not a
quality naturally approved of in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cornwall</ENAMEX>, neither is
undue modesty: standing in his own light like the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Market Jew</ENAMEX> (another apocryphal figure).
Pride is rebuked as, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fancies</ENAMEX> she was brought up in
Court, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX> one end and she t'other!  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laziness</ENAMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tartly</ENAMEX> described as, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ludlow</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>, leaning agen
the wall to bark.  As for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX> of weak <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>, more
strong words are forthcoming: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water</ENAMEX> bewitched and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea begrudged</ENAMEX>.

            More encouraging are the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornish</ENAMEX> sayings,
Turn the best side to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> Show off the best
side of anything and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cheer</ENAMEX> up you'll live till you
die!  More rough good humour comes out in the oft
heard, You'll do it bit by bit as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> said when she
swallowed the hatchet ...I'll manage but it's a tight
fit.

            Dark explanations may be given for misfortune in
Cornwall such as, He bin awverlooked [ill wished].
Still, bracing remarks in plenty urge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> to get on
with things.  After all, concentrate on the basics,
carry a knife, a piece of string and some money; then
you can cut, tie and buy.  Count your blessings, however
meagre, as, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">toad</ENAMEX> is a diamond in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX>'s eye.

            The idea that someone has been in a situation
very like your own, long before you, is very prevalent
in these old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornish</ENAMEX> sayings.  Often this has a warning
note, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady Fan Todd</ENAMEX> dressed to death and killed
with fashion is one, so is the curious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tongues</ENAMEX> will cut your throat with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soap</ENAMEX> or hang
you with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX>.  Just as strange is the gluttony
warning, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Dumplens</ENAMEX> after guldize
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">supper</ENAMEX>, carry me home and don't bend me, for I'm
feeling rather possed up.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanity</ENAMEX> in young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> is
checked by, Nobody will stop their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> galloping to
look at you.

            Throughout all these sayings, a downright judgmental
tone can be heard, summed up in the old
Cornish last word, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tes</ENAMEX> [it is] an' caan't be no
tesser!  No arguing with that.

            Settlement by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea</ENAMEX>




            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Astride Port Jackson</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Sydney</ENAMEX> marks
the site of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">settlement</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> a second convict settlement was established
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hobart</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tasmania</ENAMEX>.  To the north, on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moreton Bay</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Queensland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brisbane</ENAMEX> was founded;
to the south, on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Port Phillip Bay</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Melbourne</ENAMEX>.
Westward round the southern coast,
Adelaide was first approached from the sea as was, at
the western extreme, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Perth</ENAMEX>.  In time, overland routes
between these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hobart</ENAMEX>, of course, excluded)
were found but, for much of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, what
are now the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital cities</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian States</ENAMEX>
were most easily reached by sea.

            In each of these the linguistic situation obtaining
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> was replicated.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> quickly discovered
that knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dharuk</ENAMEX> (the Aboriginal
language spoken in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX>) was of no help to them in
communicating with the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aboriginesâ</ENAMEX>€”unless the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aborigines</ENAMEX> had learned words from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> in the
belief that they were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, as indeed happened
with some pidgin terms and, in the west, with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boomerang</ENAMEX> .  In each new settlement, therefore, borrowing
began anew.  So, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brisbane</ENAMEX>, dialects of
Yagara were the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> encountered, and the source of
some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX> loan words.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Melbourne</ENAMEX>, the Victorian
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">languages</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wuywurung</ENAMEX> (spoken in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dialects on
the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Melbourne</ENAMEX> and to the north and west) and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wathawurung</ENAMEX> (spoken on the western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">side</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillip</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bay</ENAMEX>) were the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> source of borrowings,
though the surviving words number no more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX>.
The language spoken on the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adelaide</ENAMEX>,
Gaurna, though unusually well recordedâ€”by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lutheran missionaries</ENAMEX> who were amongst the early
settlersâ€”again yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about ten</NUMEX> loans.  The extremes
are provided by the nameless <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Tasmanian</ENAMEX> languages,
which gave <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than three</NUMEX> words to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nyungar</ENAMEX>, the language spoken over quite
a large area in the southwest of Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> but
essentially the language of the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Perth</ENAMEX>, which
has enriched English with more than fifty loanwords.
The ignorance surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Tasmanian</ENAMEX> languages
betrays the fact that the relationships between convicts
and later <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tasmanian</ENAMEX> Aborigines
were of a hostility unreached elsewhere; the continuing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fertility of Nyungar</ENAMEX> by contrast results from a
much happier and more accommodating relationship.

            One has to assume that the words which had a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX>-based currency in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> were known to
most <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX> because they had been encountered
either in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> or in accounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX>.  Nonetheless,
there is a sense in which each new settlement
meant a new start, and consequently a duplication in
the nomenclature of key items.  Gunyah , the Dharuk
word for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwelling</ENAMEX>, is matched by the Melburnian
quamby , a verb meaning lie down, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>, and also a
noun meaning shelter, by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brisbane humpy</ENAMEX> , the
Adelaide wurley , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Perth</ENAMEX> mia mia .  Of these,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hump</ENAMEX> is now the most commonly used, in the general
sense of a hut or temporary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwelling</ENAMEX>, whether of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> provenance.  And mia mia
has been widely used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX> in this sense and, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX>, of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shooter</ENAMEX>'s hide.  But the fact
remains that, despite this diversity, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hut</ENAMEX> enjoyed a greater currency than any of the borrowings,
being the usual word for the accommodation
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">convict</ENAMEX>, the rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">labourer</ENAMEX>, and the
itinerant bushman.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pidgin</ENAMEX> acquired a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> negative,
borak , used as an alternative to baal or in a figurative
sense for humbug, nonsense, or rubbish, from
Wathawurung, whence came also an exclamation merrygig
well done and coolie , a derogatory term for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who partnered an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.  It is
ironic that lubra , a word for a black womanâ€”usually
a younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> than is connoted by the Dharuk
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gin â</ENAMEX>€”was one of the few survivals of the Tasmanian
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">languages</ENAMEX>, in which it has been suggested that it
meant penis.  From <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yagara</ENAMEX> come bung broken,
dead, yacka , both as a noun and a verb meaning
work, and yohi , an affirmative, all originally in pidgin.

            Other loanwords repeat the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> pattern, striking
or otherwise significant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX>, and weapons
being named: so there is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tasmanian</ENAMEX> boobialla , a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fruit</ENAMEX>-bearing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acacia</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melburnian</ENAMEX> bullan bullan , a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beautiful bird</ENAMEX> with a lyre-shaped tail, the Brisbane
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yungan gong</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adelaide</ENAMEX> pinkie , a bilby or bandicoot,
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Perth</ENAMEX> quokka , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of wallaby.  And
there are local names for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, like weet-weet , a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> missile used both as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> and as a toy,
-wirra , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>, and kylie , a West
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> boomerang.

            Each new settlement meant a new beginning but
so limited was the relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> and
Aborigines that there was little progress beyond the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Port Jackson</ENAMEX> model.  Not until travel by land supplemented
and eventually replaced that by sea did incremental
borrowing became at least a possibility, just
as the passage of time meant that there was a likelihood
that a language would be more fully and more
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">competently</ENAMEX> recorded.
         
         
            The Case of Nyungar





            Exploration and settlement overland followed
travel by sea.  In particular, once the mountain barrier
had been overcome, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> area
moved inland and to the north.  Thus the languages
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New South Wales</ENAMEX> inlandâ€”Wiradhuri and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamilaroi</ENAMEX> and its dialect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuwaalaraayâ</ENAMEX>€”formed part
of a borrowing continuum which began with Dharuk
and which incorporated the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> pidgin which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Collins</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Fleet</ENAMEX>, had described
as a barbarous mixture of English with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Port Jackson</ENAMEX> dialect.  Words like gammon and piccaninny ,
from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> slang and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> pidgin respectively,
joined a range of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port Jackson</ENAMEX> words to form a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pidgin</ENAMEX> in which limited communication was possible.
This was added to as it travelled north and west by
words like yabber talk, based on the root ya -, found
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wiradhuri</ENAMEX> and other languages), the Yagara
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brisbane</ENAMEX>) words bung dead, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">humpy dwelling</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yacka</ENAMEX> work (as noun and verb), and, particularly, by
names for <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX> the travellers now recognized
as being commonly found in the inland.  So
Wiradhuri words like corella and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang-gang</ENAMEX> , names
for cockatoos, kookaburra , a kingfisher, boggi , a lizard,
belah , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Casuarina</ENAMEX>, billabong anabranch, gilgai waterhole,
and bondi , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>, became parts of everyday
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian English</ENAMEX>, as did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamilaroi</ENAMEX> words brolga ,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crane</ENAMEX>, budgerigar , a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parrot</ENAMEX>, coolamon wooden
vessel or basin, gundy , yet another word for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hut</ENAMEX>, and
towri <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> of an Aboriginal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuwaalaraay</ENAMEX> words galah , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parrot</ENAMEX>, and
gidgee , an acacia, and words common to Kamilaroi
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuwaalaraay</ENAMEX> like the names of other species of
acacia such as boree and mulga .  When a would-be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">poet</ENAMEX> writes the lines,



Where the tangled boree blossoms,
Where the gidya thickets wave,
And the tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yapunyah</ENAMEX>'s shadow
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rests</ENAMEX> upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stockman</ENAMEX>'s grave
            

            he has, in a sense, guaranteed the currency of the
words he uses.

            Much the same sort of continuum exists in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">west</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nyungar</ENAMEX>, which had a number of advantages
over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dharuk</ENAMEX>, has provided for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 150</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> a source of loan words.  First, the settlement in
the west took place some <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> after that in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> had a better idea of what they
were handling.  <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, though the language is no
longer spoken, it was more fully and more intelligently
recorded than those first encountered.  And,
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, as a matter of governmental policy, Aboriginal
names for <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX> have been preferred.  So,
for instance, the names of the farmed freshwater crayfish,
koonac , and marron , have only short histories of
usage in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, coincident with their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>, though
they were first recorded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>.  And
there are substantial lists of the names of treesâ€” jarrah,
karri, mallett, marri, tuart , and wandoo â€”and of
animalsâ€” chuditch, dalgite, dunnart, kumarl, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">nool-benger</ENAMEX> ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">numbat â€”that</ENAMEX> are familiar at least in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">west</ENAMEX>.

            There are also words representative of other
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> life, such as boylya cleverman or
wise elder, gnamma waterhole, kylie boomerang,
miamia <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwelling</ENAMEX>, monaych , originally the name of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cockatoo</ENAMEX> and by transference a police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>, nyoongar
Aboriginal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, wagyl , the mythical rainbow
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">serpent</ENAMEX>, wilgie , a red ochre used to paint the
body on ceremonial occasions, and wongi , a word for
an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, originally used around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kalgoorlie</ENAMEX>.

            But, though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nyungar</ENAMEX> words supply a more
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> picture of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> life than do the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dharuk</ENAMEX> or those from any single inland language, the
greater number of words used to denote key notions
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> belief and life are special uses of English
words like cleverman, which has replaced words like
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dharuk</ENAMEX> koradji and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nyoongar</ENAMEX> boylya , which
are effectively obsolete.  So the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> equivalent
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creation</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dreamtime</ENAMEX> , itself a translation of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alcheringa</ENAMEX> (an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Aranda</ENAMEX> word), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bark hut</ENAMEX> is preferred
to gunyah or humpy, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamilaroi</ENAMEX> towri ,
and walkabout to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nyungar</ENAMEX> pink-eye .  And bark
paintings are known in the terms in which they are
characterized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eye</ENAMEX>, as dot or X-ray
paintings.  The language of the invaders is the language
of choice, except in the artificially maintained
case of the nomenclature of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX>.

            In other words, although the opportunity was
there for borrowing on a larger scale and with a degree
of comprehensiveness that had not been
achieved hitherto, it has not been taken.  In the west,
as elsewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, the lexicographical evidence
of a developing understanding of the indigenous peoples
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> is slight indeed.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proliferating Plurals</ENAMEX> (and Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singular Substitutions</ENAMEX>)



            It seems that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> have invented a new rule: Whenever possible,
use plurals.  Thus television, radio, and newspaper
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> tell us:



<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Aids</ENAMEX> and assistances were given by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Cross</ENAMEX>.

The conditions of the bombing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> are unknown.

            At the same time, perhaps from an unconscious discomfort
caused by so many perplexing plurals, there
has been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX>trend in the opposite direction.  One
form has been the de facto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singularization</ENAMEX> of some
commonly used words of foreign origin: L <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>,
datum, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, stratum ; It graffito ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LL</ENAMEX> (fr <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gk</ENAMEX>) phenomenon ;
Gk criterion .  Though all are currently
being used almost exclusively in plural form, they are
treated as if they were singular, e.g., a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, etc.
The more usual form of singularizing appears when
we are told that someone is no longer in the good
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grace</ENAMEX>  of someone else; the ground for divorce was...;
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> or custodian (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">janitor</ENAMEX>] of a school
building was also responsible for the upkeep of its
ground ; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>, evidently mightily disturbed
by the prevalent pluralism, even tried to
make a singular noun still more so by lopping off its
final s : a specie of mammal (which one might think is
right on the money).  Though the singular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insanity</ENAMEX> is
far outstripped by the multiple mania, one can expect,
in this age of downsizing, to encounter more of
the less and less of the more.

         
         
            What's In a Name?
            This slightly enlarged version of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Dickson</ENAMEX>'s
Names , published by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delacorte Press</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, is a
light-hearted collection of names that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> considers
to be interesting for one reason or another.  We
are invited to share his delight in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embraceable Zoo</ENAMEX>
(for a store selling toys), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Onan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy Parker</ENAMEX>'s pet
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">canary</ENAMEX> who spilled his <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robot Redford</ENAMEX> (a robot
which once gave a commencement address), and
many similar examples.  For most of us, these are typical
tit-bits that raise a passing smile when we come
across them as column-fillers in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>.  To
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">irrespressible</ENAMEX> name-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Dickson they</ENAMEX>
bring the thrill of a new find that anyone who has
ever collected anything will understand.  I have
known a few name-collectors in my time, and they
are an enthusiastic bunch.  I remember <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbard</ENAMEX> showing me the filing cabinets in his New
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>, crammed with lists of personal names
like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mollie Panter-Downes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Romeo Yench</ENAMEX> .  I also
recall with affection the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Leaver</ENAMEX>, who cycled
around the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> countryside as a boy collecting
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pub-</ENAMEX>names.  He was still collecting them in his seventies.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Leaver</ENAMEX> is not mentioned in this book, which
is very thin on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>.  Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickson</ENAMEX> says, for
instance, that he has long had a special passion for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apple</ENAMEX> names, and quotes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> of them,
but he ignores the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Apple Register</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uriel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.G. Smith</ENAMEX>, which catalogues
the names of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22,000</NUMEX> cultivars.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss Smith</ENAMEX>
once amused herself by working <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">365</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apple</ENAMEX> names into
a story, which began:



<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Toogood</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Little</ENAMEX>
Beauty, but rather a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Coquette</ENAMEX>, despaired of ever seeing
a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Golden/Ring on the Lady's Finger...</ENAMEX>)
            

            We need not cavil, of course, at the absence of such
obvious reference <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>; in a work like this the author
has the right to favour serendipity over methodical
research.

            Whether he has the right to be needlessly careless
in his statements is perhaps another matter.  As a
typical example, we read that the word derrick , derived
from the surname of a famous hangman, was
in use for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> as a name for the gallows.  A
glance at the citations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> or at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Partridge</ENAMEX>'s article
in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Name Into Word</ENAMEX> , which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickson</ENAMEX> cites in his
bibliography, would have made it clear that this usage
did not extend beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>.  It is also
news to me that I once wrote a book called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First</ENAMEX>
Names , mentioned on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">138</NUMEX>.  Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickson</ENAMEX>'s definition
of name is itself rather unsatisfactory.  Why are
we suddenly treated on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> to an incomplete list
of -ine words ( bovine, feline, lupine , etc.)?  What are
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nouns</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wettfahrt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fahrtwind</ENAMEX> (printed
without their capital letters) doing here?  The latter
may interest those who make a special study of flatulence
(perdologists?), if such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> exist, but these
are not names.

            There is no need to include non-names in a book
of this kind when we are surrounded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of
minor nomenclatures.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> on which these
words are printed, for instance, as well as the typeface
and even the ink, have names.  Almost any generic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noun</ENAMEX> can be broken down into named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subdivisions</ENAMEX>.
To a knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pogonologist</ENAMEX>, a beard is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bodkin</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral, Ducktail</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goatee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lavatory Brush</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial</ENAMEX>,
Pique-devant, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spade, Stiletto</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vandyke</ENAMEX> , to name but
a few.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least two hundred</NUMEX> types of hat have more
specific names.  If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickson</ENAMEX> wished to remain thoroughly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>, he could still find interesting names
on his doorstep.  Let me recommend the names of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-pin bowling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>, which often pun on strike, split ,
or pin .  (The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-fifties <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> for which I play is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hot</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irons</ENAMEX>: we strike while the iron's hot and also play
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX>.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Merriam-Webster</ENAMEX> say that this book forms part of
their lighter side of language series.  I hope that
they will at some stage do justice to the more scholarly
work that has been done, especially on place names
and personal names.  Names and naming rightly attract
the attention of philologists, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX>,
literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>, and others.  Huge sums of
money are spent on finding suitable brand names.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Dickson</ENAMEX> has every right to approach names in a
light-hearted way, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juliet</ENAMEX>'s question, What's in a
name?  can be answered in many more intellectually
satisfying ways than this.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thames Ditton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Surrey</ENAMEX>
            
         
         
            Chasing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jonathon Green</ENAMEX> has deservedly acquired the
mantle of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Partridge</ENAMEX> as the foremost authority on
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> slang.  His books are many; listed on the back
flap of the dustjacket of this book are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macmillan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contemporary Slang</ENAMEX>, The Slang
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thesaurus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neologisms</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Words</ENAMEX> Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>, Slang
Down the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ages</TIMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Historical Development of Slang</ENAMEX> ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Dictionary of Jargon</ENAMEX> .

            The present work is a departure for him, for most
of his earlier works have been reference books.  I
have heard some of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX>'s broadcasts and interviews,
and he comes off quite well, for he is smooth and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glib</ENAMEX>, just what is needed for radio.  That style translated
into book form, however, makes this book seem
greatly overwritten.  Its main fault lies in the reliance
on extensive quotations from the works described,
the sort of thing one expects to be paraphrased by a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">historian</ENAMEX>, with the original matter buried in footnotes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mercifully</ENAMEX>, there are few such notes, and they come at
the end of the book where they can be ignored.  The
problem with the quotations is that they are often
quite long and neither interesting nor revealing, often
serving to support a point made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, whom
I would be happy to believe on his own recognizance.
Still, there are a number of errors which ought to be
corrected for any subsequent edition or printing.
            

            Green's account of the early history of dictionary-making
is very useful and interesting, for it gathers
together information about the personal lives (and
qualificationsâ€”or lack thereof) of the famous lexicographers.
One might quarrel with an occasional
comment (like, [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Techne</ENAMEX> ] might be said to have
become the basis of every <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> textbook that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolboys</ENAMEX>,
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> and elsewhere, would face until the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year 1000</TIMEX>, which must have encompassed a relatively
small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX>), but such are few and far between in
the earlier chapters of the book.  It is not till we arrive
at the final chapter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Modern World</ENAMEX>, that serious
inadequacies rear their ugly heads.

            Green writes:



[<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Lexicographers</ENAMEX>] have retained their priestly role, especially
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, and especially in the world of
what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America</ENAMEX> terms college and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> concise
dictionaries,...

[<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p. 359</ENAMEX>]
            

            The simple facts are that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> college (or
desk) dictionaries today contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 170,000</NUMEX> entries
(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> that number of headwords), up from
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Â±130,000</NUMEX> they had till <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> concise
dictionaries contain far fewer than that: the Concise
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> , the best-selling dictionary in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>, contains
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 120,000</NUMEX> entries (probably not more than about
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60,000 headwords</NUMEX>), which is equivalent to what are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classed</ENAMEX> as concise dictionaries in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.  As far as
I am aware, what are called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> or desk dictionaries
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> have no special label in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>,
though <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several</TIMEX>, notably the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Collins Dictionary</ENAMEX> , are of
comparable extent.

            Green is correct in writing that the (unabridged
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Funk & Wagnalls</ENAMEX>) Standard <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of the English</ENAMEX>
Language (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1893</TIMEX>) gives <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pronunciations for each
entry, but he is mistaken in reporting that one represents
the popular pronunciation, the other showing
the precise <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p.364</ENAMEX>]: there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pronunciations
because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> employs a more popular, presumably
understandable pronunciation key (called, in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">phonetics</ENAMEX> trade, a broad transcription) while the
other cleaves to a scholarly transcription (called a narrow
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX>); if such a pattern were followed
today, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> would be the simplified system used
generally in most dictionaries and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> would
employ the symbols of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Phonetic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alphabet</ENAMEX> (which, for their more recondite transcriptions,
require a trained phonetician for their understanding).

            
In discussing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merriam-Webster</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New International Dictionary</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MW-III</ENAMEX>),
Green describes one of its main advances as a general
move away from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s traditional prescriptive
lexicography, towards a more descriptive, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
style. Such a move had, indeed, taken place many
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Gove</ENAMEX>'s editorship of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">MW-III</ENAMEX>
and is evidenced in such works as the Merriam-Webster
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collegiate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s New World, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American College</ENAMEX> dictionaries, among others.  Some
of these dictionaries contain notes describing contentious
issues of usage (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infer</ENAMEX>/imply, reason is
because/that , etc.), but those are, essentially, reflective
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of the language, hence
can be set forth as descriptive.

            On page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">366</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> refers to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">MW-III</ENAMEX> as containing
450,000 headwords: it does not, of course; it
contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450,000</NUMEX> entries.  The notion of entry, as described
many times in these pages, includes (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>-word,(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inflected</ENAMEX> forms (which, in the sole case of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">MW-III</ENAMEX> , includes regular inflections, which pumps
up the entry count considerably), (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) changes in parts
of speech, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) embedded boldface entries (like idioms
and phrases), (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) run-on forms (those that are added at
the ends of entries to illustrate headwords with suffixes
of transparent meaning added, e.g., national and nationally
run on to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> and nationalization run on to
nationalize , (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) spelling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> (like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> honour,
nationalise, nationalisation , etc.).  Thus, a dictionary
with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 80,000</NUMEX> headwords, the size of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX>, contains more than
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170,000</NUMEX> entries.  I do not know how many headwords
the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">MW-III</ENAMEX> contains, but it is far, far fewer than
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450,000</NUMEX> entries claimed.  (Those who greet with
consternation what might seem to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>'s fiddling
with counts in dictionaries ought to know that the
system for such counting was worked out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>,
mainly between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merriam-Webster</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury Department</ENAMEX>, which was then in charge of all
government purchases, as a means for assessing the information
content of dictionaries being purchased for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, a responsibility later shifted to another
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>.)

            On page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">379</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> writes:



There are, after all, a number of books of Americanisms
but none, although there have been plans to fill
this gap, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Briticisms</ENAMEX>.
            

            That is not quite accurate, for, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macmillan</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US; Johnson</ENAMEX> & <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacon</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>) published

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM BOOKS</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>; revised and expanded further,
it was published as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British English</ENAMEX> A to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zed</ENAMEX> by
Facts On File in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1990</TIMEX>. It is not entirely accurate
to describe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schur</ENAMEX>'s book as a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>, for, although
it is in alphabetical order (by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briticism</ENAMEX>, with
the American equivalent in the Index), it combines
definitions with descriptions of cultural phenomena
(as in the entry for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ashes</ENAMEX> , which needs an explanation
rather than a mere definition).

            Green's treatment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern World</ENAMEX> of lexicography
is very thin on the ground.  Bare mention is
made of the most important and best-selling dictionaries
published in the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty years</TIMEX>, when the sales of
all kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> exploded throughout the
world.  It is probably true to say that an entire book
could be written about this recent period in dictionary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, including not only the reflection of
sound linguistic philosophy but the effects of the introduction
of computers into the dictionary research,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compilation</ENAMEX>, composition, and accession (as through
personal computers to CD-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROMS</ENAMEX> and diskettes): certainly
there is more documented information about it than
the period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several hundered years</TIMEX> covered in the first
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> chapters of Chasing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> .

            But one must be grateful to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jonathon Green</ENAMEX> at
least for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX>, which gather in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place an enormous amount of interesting, useful

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Care Terms</ENAMEX>
            We need not be bludgeoned with the information
that the world has become more bureaucracy-ridden
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few decades</TIMEX>, a trend that probably began
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> to be reinforced through <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II.
It is probably the language that has borne much of the
burden in that development: the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> citation for
acronym in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX>, quotes <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> Notes
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queries</ENAMEX> , which refers to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, unidentified
usage of the term.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1940s</TIMEX> we were besieged
by repl <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">depots</ENAMEX> (pronounced REPil DEPOZe), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> ,
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of other acronyms and abbreviations
the meaning of which we learned through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> repetition
on news broadcasts.

            (I find it convenient to distinguish an abbreviation
as a shortening that is not or cannot be pronounced,
like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>, from an acronym as a shortening that is pronounced
as a word, like ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lib</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WREN</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COMSAT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> , etc.  Those who specialize
in this area prefer to subsume them all under the general
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rubric</ENAMEX>, initialism , a term quoted by the OED
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from the 1890s</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Notes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queries</ENAMEX>, but one that
did not become current, I believe, till <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gale Research</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Company</ENAMEX> published <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Acronyms and Initialisms Dictionary</ENAMEX> ,
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX>.  An enormous work, that book has
grown by the publication of periodic supplements.)

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Care</ENAMEX> Terms contains a good deal besides
initialisms, but I focus on those because they are probably
most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the jargon we are faced
with whenever we encounter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureaucracy</ENAMEX>: as if
the compounding of incomprehensible, undescriptive
jargon were not enough, those who concoct that obfuscating
gobbledygook are not content till they have
turned it into an abbreviation or an acronym.  The jargon
also becomes sprinkled with euphemisms, among
which I count health care professional , a definition for
whichâ€”too long to repeat hereâ€”appears in this book
under professional .  Part of it (excluding the awkward
pronoun of reference) is pertinent:



...[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ome individuals</ENAMEX> may call themselves professional
with little or no training.  For example, there
are no minimum requirements to be a nutritionist,
so anyone can call him or herself <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.
            

            During a recent hospital stay (my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>), I learned that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who mops the floor is referred to as a
health professional, along with what I would have
called the medical orderly who has the responsibility
for taking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX>, the registered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> in attendance,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> floor or ward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX>, and the various
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>.  Having been the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> in chief of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosby's Medical</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nursing Dictionary</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">first edition</TIMEX>),
it occurred to me that I, too, might be termed
a health care professional; so too, perhaps, might
an inveterate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypochondriac</ENAMEX>.

            This book can do nothing, of course, to relieve us
of the sort of vocabulary that makes a garbage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> or
dustman into a waste removal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX>, but it is
enormously helpful in explaining, in a straightforward
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> and (unfortunately) without rancor, what bureaucracy
has bequeathed us.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evidently</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GP</ENAMEX> no
longer exists, having been replaced by the family
practice practitioner, now considered a medical specialty.
Naturally, family practice is referred to as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPâ</ENAMEX>€”what else?  why not FamPrac?â€”for which
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Care Terms</ENAMEX> offers the following definition:


The specialty of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> which deals with providing,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">supervising</ENAMEX>, and coordinating the continuing
general medical care of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> of all ages, primarily
in family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.  The care provided is primary care.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the medical specialties for which residency
programs have been approved by the Accreditation
Council for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Graduate Medical Education</ENAMEX> (ACGME).
See specialty.
            

            I suppose that means that as an aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divorcÃ©</ENAMEX> who
lives alone, I am only marginally entitled to treatment,
for a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> can scarcely be considered a
family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.  This specialty reminds me of a time,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some decades ago</TIMEX>, when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> advised me, indignantly,
that he was not a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GP</ENAMEX>: gesturing to a
framed certificate hanging on the wall of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, he
told me in no uncertain terms that he was an internist,
to which I replied that I should thereafter
require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>, an internist and a dermatologist.
He didn't see the humor of that remark.

            If one's field touches on the medical profession,
insurance, or any other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> concerned with the bureaucracy
(which I am always tempted to spell bureaucrazy),
this is an essential aid in unraveling and
clarifyingâ€”insofar as is possibleâ€”the verbiage that
assails <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from all sides.  Although the average victim
of the medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureaucracy</ENAMEX> need not have this as a
vademecum, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, private, and, especially, hospital
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">librarians</ENAMEX> should note its great value as an adjunct to
the other reference books available, none of which
covers the same territory.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appendices</ENAMEX> round
out the usefulness of this work.

            It would be only fair to mention that the terminology
is that used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.

            Ship to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shore</ENAMEX>

            My aim in this work is to illustrate what I believe is
the astonishing debt that our idiomatic speech owes
to the nautical language of the past.  <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is extraordinarily
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX> in metaphor, and it is the intention of
this book to show that many of the figures of speech
that we use from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> to day derive from the language
and customs of the sea.

            â€”From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preface</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter D. Jeans</ENAMEX> is an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> who writes a column
in The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">West Australian</ENAMEX> on the origin of words.
This is a substantial, useful, interesting work, but if the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader/user</ENAMEX> is seeking an authoritative, documented
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archive</ENAMEX> of nautical expressions, he may be disappointed.
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> are aware, we give
short shrift to the trappings of academia in our pages:
we eschew footnotes (with rare exceptions) as well as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bibliographies</ENAMEX>.  But in reviewing the works of others,
attention must be paid to such materials, and the
Bibliography of Selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Sources</ENAMEX> and Dictionaries
Consulted include only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-five</TIMEX> titles under the
former category (plus fifteen of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick O'Brian</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jack</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aubrey</ENAMEX> novels) and only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> under the latter, some of
which are curious choices indeed: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Hunter</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Dictionary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collier</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1897</TIMEX>, which I have never heard of; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Partridge</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Modern English</ENAMEX> contains a great many errors and
ought to be avoided by serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>; the author
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evidently</ENAMEX> chose not to wade through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>,
relying instead on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McAdam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milne</ENAMEX>'s A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Selection</ENAMEX>.
            

            Still, it is unfair to judge a book by its peripherals.
Before getting to the content, let us look at the appendices,
of which there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, Nautical
Prepositions, includes aback, abeam, about, abox,
a-cockbill, adrift, and other words that are adverbs,
not prepositions, along with ahoy and a few others
beginning with a -: evidently the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> believes that
many nautical words beginning with a- are prepositions,
which is simply not the case.  <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Appendix 2</ENAMEX> contains
Changed <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Spellings and Corrupted Word Forms</ENAMEX>;
although the information given here is accurate as far
as I could tell, it is confusing to have some words
listed under their original spelling (studding sail,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">treenail</ENAMEX>) and others in their corrupted form (gunnel,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bosun</ENAMEX>) â€”and what happened to trunnel?  I fear that
there is a great deal more to the question of spelling
and pronunciation than has been allowed for.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Appendix 3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nautical Terms Related to Human</ENAMEX>
Anatomy, shows nauticalisms that were borrowed
from anatomical terms, not the other way round.  The
coverage is a bit loose, but no one is likely to consider
earring an anatomical term, and forelock, a
small iron wedge of pin driven through a hole or slot
at the end of a sheave-pin to prevent it from working
out, contains a - lock from a door, not from a forehead,
which has a different etymological origin.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nautical Terms Derived</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land</ENAMEX>, Appendix
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, is divided into the sublistings Domestic
Environment and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Environment</ENAMEX>.  The suitability
for such treatment varies: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bosun</ENAMEX>'s chair is listed
simply because it is a chair; cap is listed presumably
because it is thought to refer to an item of apparel.
But a chair is virtually anything for an individual to sit
on and cap, etymologically at least, originally meant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cape</ENAMEX> (with a hood) or so the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> has it.  Without
dated citations for the earliest occurrences of these
words in a nautical context, how is one to know if they
were derived from the Land or merely coincidental
with them?

            Still, no serious harm.  Let us now turn to the
main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of the work.  Opening it at random we
find, appropriately enough,



<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hogwash Sailor</ENAMEX>'s slang for nonsense, rubbish, a tale
with no truth in it; and worthless stuff:
His claim that he is an experienced
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor</ENAMEX> mechanic is all hogwash.
            

            Aside from the unfortunate quotation, which hardly
seems nautical at all, hogwash is ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>,
which, it may be assumed, (English-speaking) sailors
used as a medium in which to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couch</ENAMEX> their nauticalisms.
Thus, the direction would seem to have been
from everyday word to language of the sea, and not,
as advertised, vice versa.  The same must be said for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hitch</ENAMEX>, go without a hitch, get hitched, hoist, hold off,
hold on , and scores of other entries: these were everyday
words in the general language before they were
used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX>.  The problemâ€”and it is a serious oneâ€”
is that there are, indeed, many words and phrases that
originated at sea and were brought ashore for ready
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embodiment</ENAMEX> in everyday speech, but to find the same
terms in both does not justify the assertion that the sea
term came first.

            It must be saidâ€”and I believe I shall be borne out
on thisâ€”that relying on citations appearing in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> or in works written long ago is a precarious business:
the only accurate, safe statement that can be
made about such information is that it provides evidence
for the existence of a word in a given context at
the time of publication of the work: it cannot and must
not be construed as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time the word appeared
on the face of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>, merely as the first written
evidence we have of its appearance.  Clearly, that is not
to say that most words appearing in quotations in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> and in any other (original) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> are being used
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first time</TIMEX>: on the contrary, it is very likelyâ€”and
this might well apply to terms of art of a specialized
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX> and, particularly, the speech of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX>, who did
not enjoy an entirely savory reputationâ€”that the terms
were in oral use for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> before they were written
down.  Consider how long it took lexicographers to
include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-letter words in their dictionaries; yet we
know from long experience with spoken <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> that
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five hundred years</TIMEX> hence would be wrong
to conclude that those terms were invented or even
came into general use at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 20th century</TIMEX>.
(And still not all are listed.)

            A problem arises when those who would swallow
dictionaries whole are left to conclude that their content
is sacrosanct.  Those who try to apply a scientific
approach to the assessment of data become rapidly
aware that what we are examining is not likely to be
completeâ€”which is certainly true when dealing with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">languageâ€”or</ENAMEX> even accurate, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alchemists</ENAMEX> and
other early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> in science discovered.

            There is a certain charm seen in working the
alchemy of language, and we can well appreciate it in
the context of artistic license.  But it is quite another
thing when it is foisted on an unsuspecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> as
fact, when, indeed, it is either pure speculation or a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">writer's</ENAMEX> interpretation of the best way to make data fit
into the procrustean bed of his theory.

            There is no doubt that much controversy has surrounded
the interpretation of the word devil in nautical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contexts</ENAMEX> and, particularly, with the expression
between the devil and the deep blue sea.  Likewise, it
is indisputable that many nautical expressions have
come ashore to be used metaphorically by landlubbers.
The problem is that although many such expressions
have been included in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ship</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shore</ENAMEX>, many
that were not nautical have also been listed.  As it is
impossible for the non-expert to sort them out, it remains
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeans</ENAMEX> to do so, and he has incautiously
included many for which insufficient
evidence exists that they were originally nautical, and
he has failed in his duty by not identifying questionable
entries.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nineteenth-Century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>
            It is always a good idea to read an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s preface
(or foreword) to discover the purpose of a book
before reading and, certainly, before reviewing it.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bailey</ENAMEX>'s, we quote the following,
which pretty much sums up his attitude toward language
in general and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in particular:



<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is a single language full of variety, and I believe
that no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> is beneath notice and no single
one has exclusive rights to represent the language.
Models assuming metropolis and hinterland, capital
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>, standard language and dialect have little
to offer except fragmentation and prejudice.
            

            It is virtually impossible to argue against such a point
of departure from the standpoint of the linguistic scientific
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>.  After all, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>, virology, and bacteriology would look
quite foolish were they to adopt the high moral
ground by damning the causes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> as sinful or
bad.  Yet the issue of good vs. bad is always at
the forefront when language comes up for discussion,
not, perhaps, among linguists but, to be sure, among
the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.  In some cases, murder,
mayhem, and, to borrow a tasteless euphemism from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> conflict, linguistic cleansing have been
aroused by languageâ€”not by vituperation, cursing,
and blasphemy but simply by being in the wrong
place at the wrong time speaking a particular language
or dialect.  Dialect differences can cause strife
and disharmony, as can be witnessed in the contemporary
dispute over the decision by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> school
district to use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ebonics</ENAMEX> as a vehicle to teach
Standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linguists</ENAMEX> might well distance themselves from
such mundane anti-intellectualism, but that does not
make it go away nor does it solve the problem or
come close to answering the question of what should
be done about teaching language.  A very telling point
in such disputes is that those who speak a dialect
other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard</ENAMEX> (which we persist in putting in
quotation marks because it continually changes, both
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temporally</ENAMEX> and geographically) are condemned to accept
work that is below a level, socially and economically,
to which they aspire and to which they feel they
are entitled, at least from the standpoint of opportunity.

            
As I have held, while language itself can the subject
of cool analysis in some contexts, it is a social institution
and our means of communication.  While it
is not only scientific and scholarly but noble to maintain
that such matters as pronunciation, usage, dialect,
and other features are all part of the description
of language and are neither good nor bad, the fact
remains that using a dialect or speech pattern that is
unacceptable to those who are giving out the jobs may
mean that one either gets the job or not, other qualifications
being equal, hence the scientific and
scholarly considerations may be effectively put into
their academic niches where they belong.

            There is another aspect to the entire subject, invariably
ignored by linguists and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguistic scientists</ENAMEX>
because they remain unable to measure or quantify it,
namely, style.  Language is language says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>,
totally ignoring (sometimes deliberately, usually owing
to lack of discernment) any artâ€”or lack thereofâ€”that
might be involved in the speech or writing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>,
whether professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> or not.  (Some
might protest that the study called stylistics deals with
art in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX>, but those who know the nature of
stylistics are aware that it does not even come close to
measuring effectiveness, poetry, eloquence, beauty,
and other characteristics associated with artistic expression.)

            
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the language of an individual reflects his
culture, which is a catch-all term covering many
things.  There are those of an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> that
considers itself better educated than almost anyone
younger who understand culture to mean familiarity
with the better and more important works of art (of all
kinds) of the world.  This interpretation of culture, is
admittedly, of decreasing importance to an increasing
proportion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, who place rock 'n' roll
stars on the same scale of artistic accomplishment as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rembrandt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mozart</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gershwin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>; because the last do not speak to them, they
are peremptorily shouldered out of consideration.
This aspect of language should not be construed solely
as a demonstration of knowledge (as in knowing how
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symphonies</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beethoven</ENAMEX> wrote, whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caruso</ENAMEX>
was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenor</ENAMEX> or a bass, or being able to hum melodies
from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puccini</ENAMEX>'s operas), though that is certainly a reflex
of a cultured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>.  Rather, it is the artistry that
rubs off on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> steeped in the best parts of
the culture, the phrase unconsciously plucked from a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">poem</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> play, (no matter
how corny, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Methinks</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> doth protest too
much), the single word that indicates at least passing
familiarity with history (like defenestration ), the fragment
of an air associated with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bach</ENAMEX> fugue.

            These aspects of language are social, philosophical,
artistic, largely ignored by linguists, sometimes
out of devotion to what is perceived as the scientific
method, sometimes out of sheer philistinism and the
inability to exercise taste, sometimes out of abject ignorance.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> need only read the academic papers
published in linguistic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> to be convinced that,
notwithstanding their specialty, linguists at large are
incapable of writing simple, expository, declarative
sentences without resorting to turgid syntax, obscure
vocabulary, and uncompromising sesquipedalianism.
In short, considering that their specialty is language,
it is astonishing how few of them use it effectively.

            In this regard, I am pleased to say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bailey</ENAMEX> is an exception.  Though a linguistâ€”and a good
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oneâ€”he</ENAMEX> knows how to write, and how to write persuasively
and informatively.  Most of the preceding
commentary has nothing whatsoever to do with the
substance of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Nineteenth-Century English</ENAMEX>, which
traces the spread, growth, and increasing universality
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that period</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bailey</ENAMEX> examines
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Writing, Sounds, Words, Slang, Grammar</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Voices</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, to quote the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter headings</ENAMEX>,
and he does so without expressing much opinion
about them, letting the facts speak for themselves.
Well, almost.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bailey</ENAMEX>'s presentation is tinged by an
underlying suggestion of disapproval of those who
would dictate the way the language should be used.
He does not say as much expressly, but his characterization
of such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">do-gooders</ENAMEX> as pedants (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 215</ENAMEX>) and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">purists</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 223</ENAMEX>), his persistent placing of quotation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marks</ENAMEX> around words and phrases condemned by contemporary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">purists</ENAMEX> and pedants to signifyâ€”what?â€”
their quaintness?  their curiosity?

            For the most part, despite the occasional campaigning
for linguistic liberalism (aimed, obviously, at
20th- and, presumably, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21st-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>), what
emerges is an engaging picture of concerned speakers
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, some of them pedants trying to establish
(or preserve) some purity in the language, the remainder
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of the works published by the former
in the shape of grammars, usage guides, pronunciation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guides</ENAMEX>, spellers, etc.  Because <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> spelling is often
unrelated to its pronunciation and inconsistent with it,
the majority of spellers were used as teaching tools in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>; but there was also an opportunity to acquaint
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with accepted spelling forms (just as there is
today, among the bad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">speller</ENAMEX>'s dictionaries).

            There is no gainsaying that standardization of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spelling</ENAMEX> (and of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> of language) can be
helpful to communication, but like other reflexes of
language proficiency, it can also mark the relative literacy
or education of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>.  Spelling and conventional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyphenation</ENAMEX> can be linked; while I noted not
so much as a single typographical error in this book, I
saw once again confirmation of the encroaching ignorance
of those who write automatic hyphenation programs
for computers, presumably employed in the
production of the work: the oft-repeated word <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>,
properly hyphenated <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eng-lish</ENAMEX>, has been made to
conform to the other words having -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ng</NUMEX>- at a syllable
break by appearing as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eng-lish</ENAMEX> throughout.  This
rule is well known to traditional compositors, though,
curiously, it does not extend to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angle</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX> (as in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Saxon</ENAMEX> ) though they are all linked etymologically.
The same point was raised in our review
[<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">XIX, 1, 15</ENAMEX>] of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bailey</ENAMEX>'s Images of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, also
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Michigan Press</ENAMEX>).

            In his assessment of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the century</TIMEX> as a whole,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bailey</ENAMEX> discusses the progress of education, especially
public education and the spread of literacy.  In that
regard, a point to be made about the culture of the
period in contrast to the language, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>,
late in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the century</TIMEX>, of a number of reference books,
especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>' handbooks and particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phrase</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fable</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. Cobham Brewer</ENAMEX>,
which went through many printings and, revived in
the latter part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>, through several updated
editions.  It is significant because its enormous
popularity reflects the public's interest in metaphor
based on classical and cultural references understandable
only to those steeped in the literature, not
to those who, having learned to read, seldom read
anything but a dime novel, a popular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>, or a
newspaper.  Those who aspired to broader knowledge
used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Brewer's</ENAMEX> and others' books as a ready-reference
guide to culture.  It is not insignificant that their popularity
has seen a reflowering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a hundred years</TIMEX> after
their original appearance, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late in the 19th century</TIMEX>.

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nineteenth-Century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> is an interesting if
somewhat staid tracing of the development of English
into a world language, though its influence <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is
probably owing directly more to events of the past
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sixty</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> than to the growth and spread it enjoyed
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the century</TIMEX> of colonialism.  Still, there is no
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gainsaying Bailey</ENAMEX>'s ultimate argument:



<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nineteenth-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> was part of a social
transformation that changed the language and
changed the world.
            

            It remains to be seen what will be written about the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th century</TIMEX>, the close of which is seeing a spread of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> via the Internet that is regarded as so pernicious
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> that they have seen fit to prosecute
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> (with a pied Ã¡ terre in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>) for
advertising on the medium in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> without the accompaniment
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> translation.  Will the 21st
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> see still more diversification of English and
encouragement of that diversity or more standardization
and conformity to the medium employed by
major industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX>?  There is little doubt that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are driven by economic necessity will
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cleave</ENAMEX> to the language most closely associated with
financial reward, and the opportunities offered by the
Internet are immense compared with those formerly
offered by books, motion pictures, television, and
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>.  Still, it is impossible to predict accurately
what the future will bring, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a hundred years</TIMEX>
hence everyone might well be lisping in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Swahili</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Accents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dialects</ENAMEX>
            [Note: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> originally sent only the cassette,
and that is what is reviewed here.]

            This hour-long tape recording, employing the casual
format of the candid microphone, offers thirteen
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">diverse English</ENAMEX> speech patterns gleaned from as
many off the cuff interviews.

            Because no other information accompanied the
tape, this reviewer was forced to depend on the more
than slightly helter-skelter impression it leaves on the
chartless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listener</ENAMEX>.

            The quality of the tape itself is often fuzzy (no
matter that the interviews appear to be unrehearsed).
The table of contents on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sleeve</ENAMEX> omits the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX>
segment, even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> is very much
there, in his recollections of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1916</TIMEX> uprising,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd George</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tan</ENAMEX>, as well as bits and
pieces of his own life's history.

            The interviews are preceded by a set of drill-words,
presumably to establish the regional pronunciation
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> vowel sounds, which have, over the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centuries</ENAMEX>, undergone many striking changes.  Not altogether
surprisingly, the drill-words are almost without
exception spoken with great clarity, from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bristol</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northumberland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liverpool</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lowland Scots</ENAMEX>.
But once the polite obligation to enunciate these
sounds is got over, the narrators are back on familiar
ground, most of them buoyantly loquacious and quite
at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> with the art of the monologue.

            Their stories range from a mirthful account by a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bristol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> about her shiftless next-door neighbor
whose overflowing drain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gutters</ENAMEX> flooded her property,
to a somber story by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Wales</ENAMEX>
whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>'s leg was amputated in a fearful childhood
accident.

            There is no high drama in these everyday stories:
they are simply abstract and brief chronicles of time
and place, spoken artifacts for preserving the everfluctuating
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accents</ENAMEX> and dialects of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Great Britain</ENAMEX>'s intricate
linguistic hierarchy.

            It should be noted, however, that these singular
odds and ends of regional accents are far from being
useful for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> aspiring to become the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meryl</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Streep</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mistress</ENAMEX> of the (virtual) dialect.  Although they
are indisputably accurate, none of the excerpts is sufficiently
heightened to be a model for simulation,
especially given the unfocused quality of the tape itself.

            In his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX> preface to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pygmalion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bernard</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaw</ENAMEX> wrote, It is impossible for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Englishman</ENAMEX> to
open his mouth without making another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Englishman</ENAMEX>
hate or despise him.  And, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Honey</ENAMEX>, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> and phonetics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX>, wrote Does
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Accent Matter</ENAMEX>?  [rev. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVI,1,10</NUMEX>] in which he champions
the cause of teaching the Queen's <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX>, or received
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pronunciation</ENAMEX>) in order to achieve social and
economic equality for those who are passed over in the
job market because of unacceptable regional accents,
such as the nasal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">twangs</ENAMEX> and glottal stops of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cockey</ENAMEX>,
Liverpudlian, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glaswegian</ENAMEX>.

            Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pygmalion</ENAMEX> arguments are sound as well as
altruistic; but at a time when certain civilizations and
cultures are in danger of losing their spoken heritage,
these slight, quirky renderings of native speech may
prove to be as valuable as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">archaeologist</ENAMEX>'s fossil
finds.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Only this year</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ainu</ENAMEX>, an indigenous people
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hokkaido</ENAMEX>, are struggling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">valiantly</ENAMEX> and often painfully to relearn their native
language, which almost died out over the past fifty
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.  An <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ainu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> speaks for the strange, tenacious
hold of one's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> tongue: It's true the language
is almost lost, but there's a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirit</ENAMEX> still, so
I don't think it's too late.  And that appears to be the
underlying purpose of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Accents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dialects</ENAMEX>, a
fitting epigraph to which might be added <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady Percy</ENAMEX>'s
tribute to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> killed on the battlefield:

            ...[H]e was indeed the glass / wherein the noble
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> did dress themselves... And speaking thick,
which nature made his blemish, / Became the accents
of the valiant.

            Sometimes, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> use the wrong word,
its context, that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Great Disambiguator</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellison Kahn</ENAMEX> has called it [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>], will make the
meaning emerge.  Thus, when a family-planning expert
was interviewed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">60 Minutes</ENAMEX> and said,
The [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> is so abhorred by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anti-abortionist lobby</ENAMEX>..., even though abhorrence
may indeed have been the sentiment of anti-abortion
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyists</ENAMEX>, the context made clear to some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX>
that intimidate had been meant.  So, too, when
halfway through a report on cases of fraud, a local
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consumer Affairs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX>, Ursula
Lipari, said, This was obviously a sham, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX>
knew that scam was the word she should have
used.  Likewise, when in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1996</TIMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Cook</ENAMEX> said of gay marriage (a term cynics of an
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier era</TIMEX> might well have labeled an oxymoron),
The [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Catholic</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> sets the standard
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> adopt to, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX> knew that

an apparent decrease in spelling errors such as the

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliance</ENAMEX> on electronic proofreaders may, in fact, increase
phonetic errors.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Honolulu</ENAMEX>, the student <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Hawaii's</ENAMEX> campus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native English</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>, was unable to understand a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX>'s telephoned complaint about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>'s
use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> as the past tense of to ban.  She understood
the meaning of ban; she had apparently heard
its inflected past tense form; but the infinitive and
the present tense forms were unknown to her.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>'s electronic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> had not rejected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> and
therefore the word must be correct.  We can expect to
read more of such phonetic errors since even highly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">literate</ENAMEX> and careful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> will sometimes make such
mistakes and occasionally proofread in haste, as well,
though if it is pointed out, they will always understand
what the error is.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Cook</ENAMEX>'s adopt (for adapt ) might have been a
mere slip of the tongue; but when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">excuseâ€”he</ENAMEX> has been guilty of too many bloopers.

            But slips of the tongue, phonetic and spelling errors
are the least of our word woes.  On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26 June 1995</TIMEX>,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sad Stories of the Death of Kings</ENAMEX>



            Can there be any significance in the disappearance
of euphemisms for death?  Does it provide proof
that death is no longer taboo, or are such euphemisms
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of a modern contempt for flowery, imprecise
language?  For whatever reason, phrases such as
pushing up daisies, breathed his last, is no more, gone
to a better world , etc. sound decidedly old-fashioned
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>.  In some parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, however, the
death of a king is seen as a return to chaos and disorder
and is never announced directly.  Dare to announce
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> is dead in so many words and
you could soon be feeding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> yourself.  The
accepted formula varies from place to place.  The
Baule <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory Cost</ENAMEX> say that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King</ENAMEX> has

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Briggs</ENAMEX>'s nearly serious article [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXII,4</NUMEX>] about
the bowdlerizing of recent editions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s reminds
me that the same censorship is rife in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>.  For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> I have used <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twentieth Century Dictionary</ENAMEX>, first published in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1901â</NUMEX>€”I have the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">New Edition of 1939</ENAMEX>, latest impression
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1960)â€”and</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erskine Caldwell</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Webster's</ENAMEX>, it
shows its age.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers</ENAMEX>'s head <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edinburgh</ENAMEX>,
the printers are in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>; that might account for
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> words therein: some are easily
recognized, some are more obscure.

            
But what attracted me to the dictionary was its
sense of humour.  Some definitions:



<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea</ENAMEX>-serpent an enormous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marine animal</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">serpent</ENAMEX>-like
form, frequently seen and
described by credulous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX>, imaginative
landsmen, and common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liars</ENAMEX>.

non-smoker a railway compartment in which smoking
is supposed to be forbidden.

bull a ludicrous inconsistency in speech,
often said to be an especial prerogative
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irishmenâ€”I</ENAMEX> was a fine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, but
they changed me.

bump a protuberance on the head confidently
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> by phrenologists with
qualities or propensities of mind.

leal, adj. true-hearted, faithfull. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€”noun</ENAMEX>, lealty
Land o' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leal</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the
blessed after death; heaven, not
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>.
            

            There were many more.  But no longer.  Some <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> came another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Edition</ENAMEX> and the gentle wit
of some of the definitions was done away with.  This
bowdlerizing was the subject of extensive correspondence
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>) bemoaning that the
new edition had dropped the witty invention of earlier
editions.  Why new lexicographers (I'm suggesting
they belong to a new generation) want to make their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mark</ENAMEX> by eliminating these harmless jokes beats me.

            I have some sympathy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Briggs</ENAMEX>'s stance
against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> circumlocution.  Too often prisons
are called correction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>; a lavatory with urinals
a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX>; and as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briggs</ENAMEX> wrote, dope a controlled
substance.

            But I take issue with him on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing.  According
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briggs</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Penal Code</ENAMEX>, not noted for leniency,
has softened its attitude to car theft.  May I offer a better
solution?  As a long-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magistrate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Englishâ</ENAMEX>€”
now retired), I understood the legal definition of theft
was something akin to to take possession permanently
and illegally.  There were many joy-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">riders</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX>, as there are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>, mostly juveniles, who
abandon their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prize</ENAMEX> when they run out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>.  To
bracket them with serious car <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thieves</ENAMEX> would be unjust.
As far as I know, the problem has been solved in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX> by a creating another offence, less serious,
with lower penalties, driving and taking away.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Offenders</ENAMEX>, especially young ones, are usually charged
with driving without insurance and with no licence as
well, thus increasing the penalties and going some way
to mollifying the feelings of the car <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>.




         
         

            A few comments that arise from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>:

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emerson</ENAMEX>: the article did not mention a common
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> nickname pattern.  Some examples:



<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry    Bazza    Gary     Gazza    Warren   Wozza</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharon   Shazza   Darryl</ENAMEX>   Dazza
            

            The nicknames can be shortened to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bazz, Shazz</ENAMEX>, etc.
(I've never seen or heard <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hazza for Harry</ENAMEX> .)  Bazza
was the nickname of the title <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Adventures</ENAMEX>

strip <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appeared in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Private Eye</ENAMEX> and was the subject
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> films in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1970s</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Humphries</ENAMEX>
(also known for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alter ego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dame Edna Everage</ENAMEX>) is
an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> with a sharp ear for language.  I don't
know how much use the nickname pattern had before
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1970s</NUMEX>, although I'm inclined to think that the
films increased the use of the pattern.  The suffix - s
for nicknames still seems to be used, as in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following</TIMEX>,

the expressions can be humorous and often cynical.
For instance, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> has been called a neck-top

bought but never used, i.e., it just sits on the shelf.
New hardware or software, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">marketers</ENAMEX> have
trumpeted as leading-edge technology , is called bleeding-edge
technology by those who have experienced
the many problems accompanying new products.

            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">apostrophes</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Felts</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Safire's Syndrome</ENAMEX>),
I have occasionally wondered if I need an apostrophe
if the word already has an apostrophe.  For example,
if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burger King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> puts out a new product, it's
called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burger King</ENAMEX>'s new product .  On that basis, if the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organisation McDonald's</ENAMEX> puts out a new product,
shouldn't it be called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX> new product?  Or
am I just making things too complicated?

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€”Editor</ENAMEX>]
            

            The piece titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cyberspace and Khyber Pass</ENAMEX>
[XXIII<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1,11</NUMEX>] is unfortunate, to say the least.  Contrary
to assertion, the language of the internet and some of
the associated culture and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, as of
a certain time, is captured quite well in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hacker</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX> 2d edition, (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT Press</ENAMEX>).

            Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX> missed the point on so much.
For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> was not soothed by a cookie monster
which locked up your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> and kept you from
working until you provided a required response
(whose exact form was not necessarily known by the
victim) to its demand for a cookie.  Some of the definitions
are quite wrong.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flame</ENAMEX> is not distinguished
by its being ill-considered: a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flame</ENAMEX> is usually insulting
or provocative (in the sense of causing irritation); it
can also be simply persisting incessantly and rabidly
on a topic others find uninteresting (or past the point
of interest).  Flames are not any more ill-considered
than all the rest of human communication, unless you
are of a particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pacifist</ENAMEX> philosophy that deems all
acrimony ill considered.

            If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> doesn't know what a flag is, defining
it as a piece of information that is either true or false
is worse than not defining it at all.  You can think of a
flag as a marker associated with something else: the
flag can be one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, on or off, yes or no.  One
use of a flag is to mark whether information currently
in use in a computer application has been changed
since it was last saved.  If yes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> is asked
whether it should be saved upon exit; if no, the program
simply exits.  A flag is true or false only in the
very limited sense of asking the question, Is it true
that the information on the screen is different from its
counterpart on the disk?  It has nothing to do with
the correctness of the information, and the flag itself
is presumably always true.

            Almost as misleading is the idea that real time is
an amount of time such as the time it takes real people
to communicate on a telephone: real time as applied
to a computer system is actually a respected
technical term that describes using a computer for
something that is happening while the program is running,
like the computer's modification of the angles of
the flaps of an airplane in flight based on the rate of
change of the altimeter, independent of commands
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>.  This term distinguishes such programs
from the more common type, for example, calculating
a flight path based on weather predictions for use
later in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>.  Real time in jargon applies to doing
something without time for planning or previous
thought, as in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the minutes</TIMEX> before a presentation (or
indeed during it), creating a display to replace the
key prop someone forgot.  Other terms define a duration
of time in the real world as opposed to the
amount of computer processing time required for
something.  One such term is wall time (from the
clock on the wall).

            I do not claim to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the society that
uses this language, but I have traveled there and
learned a little from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX>.  Nor are my definitions
of these terms intended to be rigorous.




         
         

            I am delighted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth Flanders</ENAMEX> has tried to
show the interesting imagery underlying <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idioms</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Treasures</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXII,1,21</NUMEX>].
Unfortunately, she only browsed through the dictionary
and, thus, committed a number of deplorable inaccuracies
and infelicities.

            Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flanders</ENAMEX> lists bÃ¶ hmische <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DÃ¶rfer</ENAMEX> and
Wortsalat as synonyms.  These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words are, however,
far from interchangeable.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wortsalat</ENAMEX> means obscure
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phraseology</ENAMEX> and mysterious wording, often
referring to page-length sentences that can crop up in
the writing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>.  The phrase
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">jemandem / fiir jemanden bÃ¶hmische DÃ¶rfer / ein bÃ¶hmisches</ENAMEX>
Dorf sein could be translated as to appear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incomprehensible</ENAMEX>, inexplicable, or strange.
Originally, the phrase expressed the fact that to
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> living in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Bohemia the Slav</ENAMEX> village names
sounded strange and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> could not understand
them precisely.

            Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> would never say or write Senf
dazugeben , when they had in mind the meaning to
meddle in other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s affairs / conversation by
adding one's own piece of wisdom.  In this case it is
especially important to add the possessive adjective,
hence: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seinen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Senf</ENAMEX> dazugeben .  Otherwise it would
be assumed that you were talking about sausages and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seasoning</ENAMEX>.

            The last <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> phrase in Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flanders</ENAMEX>' article,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gesicht wie 37 Regenwetter</ENAMEX> haben , is also not
quite correct, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert J. Powers</ENAMEX> notes [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPISTOLA</ENAMEX>,
XXII<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3,14</NUMEX>].  It should be added, however, that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
figures can be used in connection with the phrase ein
Gesicht wie <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3/7/10/14 Tage Regenwetter</ENAMEX> haben .

            In More <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Treasures</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXIII,1,13</NUMEX>], die
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ã¶ffentliche Hand</ENAMEX> (singular, not plural) denotes the
state and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">municipalities</ENAMEX> in their function as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX>
and dispensers of taxes and public funds.

            Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grille</ENAMEX> (in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grillen</ENAMEX> im <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kopf</ENAMEX> haben)
means, quite correctly, <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">cricket</ENAMEX> in its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and literal
meaning, and strange and surprising idea in its figurative
sense, it ought to be mentioned that there is a
direct, traceable link between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grille</ENAMEX> acquired
its figurative sense in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX> whenâ€”at least
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germanyâ</ENAMEX>€”the superstition prevailed that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demons</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> appeared in the guise of an insect.

            The phrase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Das</ENAMEX> pabt wie die Faust aufs (not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ins</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Auge</ENAMEX>, lit.  That goes like a fist into the eye, is interesting
from a semantic viewpoint.  The comparison
signified that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ideas or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> did not go together
at all, because if someone hits you on the eye with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fist</ENAMEX>, it would, obviously, hurt very much.  Because of
frequent and ironic use, however, the proverb
changed its denotation to the opposite in Standard
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>.  The old meaning has, meanwhile, declined
in social status, frequency, and familiarity.

            As regards the term ein <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achtgroschenjunge</ENAMEX> , I really
would like to know from which reference work
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flanders</ENAMEX> has dredged up that term.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> treasures are also somewhat mutilated,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">queue</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXII,1</NUMEX>] is feminine not masculine: tirer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">le</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diable par la queue</ENAMEX>; appuyer sur <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">le</ENAMEX> champignon
means to step on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">le</ENAMEX> champignon being the
slang term for accelerator; in vivre comme un coq
en pÃ¢te there is no acute accent on the e; it is une
[not un ] autre paire de manches that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
use for something that is entirely different.  In More
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Treasures</ENAMEX>, se noyer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dans un verre</ENAMEX> means to
be incapable of overcoming even small problems and
obstacles, quite different from to make a mountain
out of a molehill.




         
         

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.A. Davidson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Problem</ENAMEX> of Names [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXIII,1</NUMEX>]
is a very good article and highly entertaining.  I have for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> suffered those who know what my particular
method of signing says about me.

            However, some of us are simply <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of circumstance.
In my case, when very young, the whole
immediate family resided in close proximity... including
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James David, Jr.</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James David</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sr.</ENAMEX>, added later).  After the customary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JD</ENAMEX>, and the like were exhausted,
there was not much left readily identifying yours truly.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Logically</ENAMEX>, then, I became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> rather than another
variant of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> .  As a result, I have been signing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. David</ENAMEX> (or just <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">David</ENAMEX> ) since the beginning.  The
choice was not even mine to make, since my signing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James D.</ENAMEX> would simply make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> call me <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX>.  Not
improper on its face, it leads to embarrassing moments
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people yell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX> as I walk away, not even
suspecting they are talking to me.  After all, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JD</ENAMEX> were my granddad and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX>, not me.  During
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">childhood</ENAMEX>, when someone yelled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX>!..  I wasn't sure
whom they were looking for, but it was a safe bet that
it wasn't me.  On the other hand, a loud <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> was
unmistakable evidence that (alas!) I had done something
to warrant the sudden attention.

            All in all a pleasant and very entertaining article,
save the skipping of those of us who have stylish
signatures by circumstance rather than by choice.




         
         

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OBITER DICTA</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXIII,3,16</NUMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Hall</ENAMEX> writes...
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX> is not a simple piece of mental
arithmetic.  But it is!  The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of any number
that ends in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX> (typically n5) = [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)]<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>.  Thus the
square of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX> = (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.6</NUMEX>)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30.25</NUMEX>.



         
         

            I had a good laugh over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.A. Davidson</ENAMEX>'s experience
with the chummy young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> who called him
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>.  If someone uses my real name, as in an opening
telephone conversation, for example, I know that
they do not know me as I rarely use it myself.  I go
through this all the time and I have several answers to
the question, What is your <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> name?  If it is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> I have just met, I say that I only reveal my real
name when we become intimate.  This, of course, has
killed off several potential relationships, so I have
given up on it.  I often say that I have the same name
as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Armstrong Custer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>.  This
has stumped almost everyone with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> exception.  My
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> comment is, I have an unlisted name.  You're
familiar with unlisted telephone numbers, aren't you?
Well I have an unlisted name.

            Now that one generally stops them in their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tracks</ENAMEX>.




         
         

            I cannot resist the temptation to comment on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Israel Wilenitz</ENAMEX>'s comment in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPISTOLA</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXIII,1,24</NUMEX>]
about my EPISTOLA [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XXII,2,10</NUMEX>] in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milton</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horowitz</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A Discouraging Word</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OBITER DICTA</ENAMEX>,
XXII<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1,13</NUMEX>].  The subject of our epistolary dialogue is
the etymology of the word balagan , a buzzword in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">modern Hebrew</ENAMEX>.

            If in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilenitz</ENAMEX>'s EPISTOLA he had written
Perhaps [instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surely</ENAMEX> ] the vehicle for carrying
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> word into modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli Hebrew</ENAMEX> was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yiddish</ENAMEX>, I would agree with him without reservation.
But recent experiences in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, as well as
casual earlier observations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> area and in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> suggest to me that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> is to the current
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashkenazic Diaspora</ENAMEX> what <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> was to earlier
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.

            The analogy is not perfect; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analogies</ENAMEX> hardly ever
are.  Unless <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> is merely a dialect of German
and not a separate language spoken almost exclusively
by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, it differs from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> spoken by the
bulk of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emigrants</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSR</ENAMEX> in being the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>' own language rather than a shared language like
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>.  In the following anecdote substitution of
the word <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> kills the joke, though I
am sure that many more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> today speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>
than speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>.



An old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> was chided by her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
for talking to their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sabra</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>,
the dialect of the ghetto, instead of in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>.
But, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> protested, I talk to
them in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> because I want them to know
they're <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>.
            

            Nevertheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and
even in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, despite pressure to learn <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>, communicate
among themselves mainly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>, hardly
ever in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>.  When <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> were allowed to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">emigrate</ENAMEX> and poured into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, the HOBOE
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PYCCKOE CJIOBO</ENAMEX>, previously an anti-Communist
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian-language</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> published in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>,
became more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> in orientation,
running ads for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">funeral parlors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">summer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>.  The best <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, in
contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Bashevis Singer</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>, wrote
their masterpieces in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>.  I have in mind <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Babel</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yevgeniya Ginsburg</ENAMEX> and her <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aksyonov</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">poets Osip Mandelshtam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Brodsky</ENAMEX>, and
in my opinion the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, Vasily
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grossman</ENAMEX>.

            Recently I accompanied my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>
where she underwent a series of diagnostic tests
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCSF/ Mount Zion Medical Center</ENAMEX>, which, I
gathered, was basically a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> institution.  I was bemused
to notice that throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> there
were signs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  I found myself
chatting with one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>.  While
waiting for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> in the reception <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, I saw a
dapper little old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> approach the information desk
and attempt in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> to get directions from the uncomprehending
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> in attendance there behind a
sign in several languages, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tagalogâ</ENAMEX>€”but not
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>.  I interpreted for the old gentleman and then
having nothing better to do, walked with him to the
building he had been directed to.  He was from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kiev</ENAMEX>.
I was once at a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>'s birthday <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> where
somehow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>, mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>, got to talking
about their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX>, most of whom came from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kiev</ENAMEX> and thereabouts.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>, laughing,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hyperbolically</ENAMEX> remarked, Well, everyone's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>
came from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kiev</ENAMEX>.  (Of course, politically the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ukraine</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ukraine</ENAMEX> tout <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> as it is now officially
called, is no longer <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>, but as for language, it is
at least as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> as it is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ukrainian</ENAMEX>.)  So I guessed
that the old gentleman was <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>, and I would bet
that he was fluent only in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>.

            If indeed <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> is the principal language of the
current <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> Diaspora, balagan , at least in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milton</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horowitz</ENAMEX>'s example where it applied to a computer
screen, might have come directly from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> into
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> without the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">intermediary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>.  Or perhaps
it was simply <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> transliteration
rather than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hebrew</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> word borrowed
from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>.
