            The small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> straggles from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> to the
school <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>.  Everyone else has already boarded
and is waiting impatiently.  Well, claims the little
girl proudly, last but not lost.  At least that's what
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> always says.  Fifty other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolchildren</ENAMEX>
hear and nod.

            That is how a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">clashing cliché</ENAMEX> gets started, or at
any rate that is the explanatory scenario I dreamed
up.  Like someone who hears a pun and then searches
for a story to use it as a punch line, over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> I
have collected mangled metaphors, battered idioms,
and twisted expressions, always looking for explanations
behind the novel usage.  Some of this may have
to do with my chosen profession, which involves poring
over student essays.  But I also hear full-grown
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, clearly native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>, talk that way.  At the
risk of opening up a whole can of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX>, let me proceed.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> category of altered expressions resembles
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">malapropism</ENAMEX> in all its unintentional oddysey.
Perhaps the simplest explanation for many of these
missed idioms is mis-hearing, as in You can't pull the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX> over my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>.  Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> rarely bother to think
about the meaning behind a figurative expression,
anything that sounds right will foot the bill.  In this
realm are several undisputed classics: cutting off
your nose despite your face is quite popular, as is the
gloomy reflection It's a doggy-dog world.  Other
highly ranked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> are taken for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">empiric</ENAMEX> victory.  It is worth noting that some of these
were first heard from the radio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falstaff</ENAMEX>
Openshaw on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Allen</ENAMEX>'s imaginary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alley</ENAMEX>,
where they were used for all intensive purposes.

            Usually these errors sound simple-minded;
many are merely careless.  Give him a wide birth, for
instance, may have been just a spelling error on a
student's paper I was reading.  But in slovenliness
sleeps the sound of new sayings.  He wants to go out
and wipe the world, for instance, has an idiosyncratic
rightness, bespeaking not a powerful conqueror but
a great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformer</ENAMEX>.  These newly created meanings are
what make these expressions more than mere mistakes,
even if at times they bring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> upshore.  I
treasure the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sage</ENAMEX> advice in Savor the best for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last and</TIMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">victor</ENAMEX> is spoiled .  And worshipers of satin , even if
it is just a typographical slip, describes a class of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> I know all too well.  Occasionally, these eras
occur on a rather high level of sophistication, such as
engaging in self-flatulation .

            A more complex category is the conflation of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> expressions.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time I stumbled across
this phenomenon, I was discussing an agenda with
a middle-aged business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX>.  We got to item
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hmm</ENAMEX>... he mused.  I'll have to touch
bases with you on that one <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>.  Only after I
replayed his sentence in my mind did I realize that it
was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a splice of</NUMEX> to touch base and I'll get back to you .
Since then, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hybrid</ENAMEX> has become so prevalent that
it hardly sounds peculiar at all.

            In fact, that kind of error crops up--or creeps
up--frequently, especially with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> expressions using
the same locution or image.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Ferguson</ENAMEX>,
writing some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years ago</TIMEX> in VERBATIM [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">XI, 4</ENAMEX>],
termed them <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bunnyisms</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bunny</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of
film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman McLeod</ENAMEX> and an egregious example
to us all.  Telling me a thing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> and out
the other is one of hers.  Figures like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gracie Allen</ENAMEX> on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> , as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Ace</ENAMEX>, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">radio</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mistress</ENAMEX> of misinformation on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Easy Aces</ENAMEX> ,
simply turned that kind of locution into a routine in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>.

            Unfortunately, that kind of routine has become
unconscious error with many; in other words, routine.
Consequently, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> will paint a portrait
of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> both incompetent and corrupt:
The left hand doesn't know how to wash the right .
His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX>, on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> hand, might speak disparagingly
of proposed reforms that he regards as
trite yet dangerous: old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> in new cans .  Other
attempts may be simply off-- the bad end of the stick
of life, there's no dog like an old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> --or inspired:
That throws a wrench into your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX>, doesn't it? , I
once heard a math <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> tell a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX>.  There
may even be instances where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> clichés trade half
their similes.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trouper</ENAMEX>'s get your ass together .  and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trouper</ENAMEX>'s get your ass in gear are often confused
as get your act in gear and get your ass together .  The
other day I heard someone described as deaf as a
bat , and now, like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> waiting for the other shoe
to drop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> above his, I listen for blind as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">post</ENAMEX> .

            Figurative accuracy seems to have gone to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hogs</ENAMEX>; is figurative language itself on the decline?  It is
certainly not encouraged in places like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York</ENAMEX>
Times , also known as the gray <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> of journalism, but
neither does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> often mix metaphors.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Politicians</ENAMEX>
often do, as they strive for an image the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
public can embrace.  In fact, one of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homemades</ENAMEX> recently made national headlines, as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Jackson</ENAMEX> protested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> ticket were cut from the same stripes .
That is a clear conflation of cut from the same cloth
and of the same stripe --what one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
once called a slip at the wheel .

            Here is another attempt at explanation: in a culture
that has deserted basic agriculture for industry,
where professions such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shoemaker</ENAMEX> and blacksmith
and cooper have all but disappeared, many people
never learn the connections between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nature</ENAMEX>, or the crafts of working with basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX>.
Since so many colorful expressions depend on these
vanished relationships, uncertainty rules the roast.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> describes her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX> as a tough nut to
catch ; a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waitress</ENAMEX> tells me approvingly as she pours
my cup of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> coffee, The busy bee catches the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> .  Yet modern technology also baffles our culture,
which tends to confuse input with feedback as a
metaphor for soliciting opinion.  Maybe the problem,
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anonymous</ENAMEX> has stated, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.

            Then there are the image-switches and intensifications.
Go ahead, break my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> , says a persuasible
type.  She bit off her nose to spite her face adds a
contortionist twist to an already harsh metaphor.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Ace</ENAMEX> once complained on the air, I've been
working my head to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>.  Getting the inside
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">skinny</ENAMEX> , as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> recently put it, is
equally grotesque-- a sight for sick eyes , as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> once said.  Here the trend seems to be
toward deepening an image already present or shifting
to a more emphatic expression.  One time-honored
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> of doing this, of course, is to insert sexual
and scatological terms.  Don't crap on my parade!
shouts a student <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist</ENAMEX> in my earshot, decrying defecation
instead of precipitation.  The reductio ad absurdum
of this move is the common declarative Fuck
that shit! , where an all-purpose verb and an all-inclusive
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noun</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stand</ENAMEX> in for all manner of once-current
idioms, including the hell with .  An early instance of
this change, when the shit hits the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> , is by now so
ingrained in the public lexicon that few recall the
original expression, when the smoke hits the fan .  In
an attempt to reverse this trend, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of
mine offers the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternate</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grits</ENAMEX> hit the pan ,
but this usage seems destined to remain a regionalism
at best, the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Southernism</ENAMEX> collected by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John H. Felts</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bumps</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grinds</ENAMEX>, and Other Lewd
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1389</TIMEX>) Gestures [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVI,3</NUMEX>].

            Sometimes the shift can be quite subtle, as in
Don't throw all your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> basket , even
though the simple verb-substitution renders the advice
devastating to anyone but an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">omelet-maker</ENAMEX>.
Sometimes the shift comes about through the omission
of a word: in a recollection entitled Master
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malaprop</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VII,2</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Higgins</ENAMEX> describes a newspaper
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> who made such proclamations as A
hand in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX> is worth <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> .  Along a similar vane,
a hardware <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> once told me that the brackets I
needed were scarce as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hens</ENAMEX> .  In truth, cutting or adding
words may occasionally result in an expression
more felicitous than the original.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> to hell is
paved with good intentions , eminently quotable, is
attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Johnson</ENAMEX> only as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hell</ENAMEX> is paved
with good intentions.  Play it again, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX> sounds better
than the actual line from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Casablanca</ENAMEX>, Play it,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congreve's Music</ENAMEX> has charms to soothe a
savage <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> was long ago altered to soothe the savage
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beast</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Euphony</ENAMEX> beats logic.  Or, as one of these idioms
might put it: take care of the sound, and the sense
will take care of itself.  At times, the image shifts
entirely through what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freud</ENAMEX> called klang <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>,
or sheer phonic similarity.  Yet Don't bite the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> that feeds you makes satisfactory sense; so does
It takes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to tangle .  I do not quite agree with the
sense underlying a tough road to hoe and his head
sank to his boots , but I assume they occasion no discomfort
on the part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>.  After all, that is
the way many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are taught.

            The last <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">group</ENAMEX> falls into what I call prepositional
trouble, as in That one threw me over the deep end .
Like some of the phrases in other categories, several
have become so common as to have ousted the original
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diction</ENAMEX>.  I cannot count how many times I have
heard of someone walking out of the door , the laws
of physics notwithstanding.  A close <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is the
request not to hold it up against me --does this refer
to a grudge or the fitting of a suit?  A similar corruption
is hanging into his every word: rapt attention or
verbal grappling?  Admittedly, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">preposition</ENAMEX> usage is
not always clearly defined: does one compare apples
to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX>, or just stick in an
and ?  Also, certain prepositional phrases, such as
waiting on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> , probably qualify as regional usage.
As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> of mine once remarked, I suppose
it is all part of the wonder about being alive.

            Let us open the drawer of conclusions.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First of</ENAMEX>
all, I do not mean to impugn non-native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">valiantly</ENAMEX> trying to master a language that often is not
even sure of itself.  Rather, the so-called unerringness
of native speech is in part hit or myth.  As Lysander
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX> reminded us in Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malaprop</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XV,4</NUMEX>], other tongues have their slips, as
well.  All languages are composed of dead metaphors
as the soil of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpses</ENAMEX>, wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Empson</ENAMEX>.
Some metaphors simply suffer a sea change.  If language
is a continual exercise in combination and
permutation, it makes sense that such expressions,
or lusus linguae , will always be with us.  They may
even infect otherwise straightforward VERBATIM
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prose</ENAMEX>, as alert <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> will have spotted.  In any
event, I am keeping my ears peeled.  It's never too
late to mend , overheard <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX>--is that a
combination of It's never too late to learn and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First</ENAMEX>
ended, soonest mended?  When will someone within
earshot confuse swear by and swear at ?

            Ah, it is a wise <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fool</ENAMEX> that knows his own mother
tongue.
         
         
            
It's turned out to be one of those red herrings
around our necks.  [Quote from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Porter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maintenance and Engineering Services</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fontana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rhyme and Punishment</ENAMEX>



            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1781</TIMEX>, it was claimed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gentleman's Magazine</ENAMEX>
that A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who could make so vile a pun
would not scruple to pick a pocket, so who dares to
deny that puns are so called because they are punishable?

            Yet despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hearer</ENAMEX>'s conventional groan and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perpetrator</ENAMEX>'s equally conventional apology, everyone
knows that verbal play gives a great deal of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pleasure</ENAMEX>, justifying the great deal of ingenuity that
goes into producing it.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Writers</ENAMEX> plainly value being
able to use words in ways that not only fail to reflect
their dictionary meaning but seem flatly to reject it.
In an article <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan Morris</ENAMEX> refers
to professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> as those of us who live by
the sweat of our ink.  Quite apart from the fact that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of writing with ink has decreasing literal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">validity</ENAMEX>, there is not much metaphorical sense
to be made here either, if we take the remark word
by word.  Ink does not sweat, we do not sweat ink,
and even the traditional fingers clutching traditional
ink-filled pens were less likely to be troubled by
sweat than by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">chilly cramp</TIMEX>.  In fact, of course, we
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">understand Jan Morris</ENAMEX> with no difficulty because she
knew that we would take the whole sequence, live
by the sweat of our ink (new to us), and map it on
to a similar one that was familiar to us.  The similarity
(in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, rhythm, wording, etc.) is doubly
important.  It supplies the stimulus to make the comparison,
and it hints that the degree of mismatch will
be the clue to the meaning.  In consequence, because
the familiar live by the sweat of our brows
means work hard for a living (no longer entailing
the sort of physical effort that cause sweating), we
are prepared to conclude that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan Morris</ENAMEX> clone
means work hard for a living by authorship .

            And maybe that is all it is meant to mean.  But
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Wilson</ENAMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Art of Rhetoric</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1553</TIMEX>)
speaks of travail and toil with the sweat of his
brows, we can be sure that he is referring to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam</ENAMEX>'s expulsion from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eden</ENAMEX> and the beginning of
toil for everyone (though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genesis III</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.19</NUMEX> in the Authorized
Version follows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coverdale</ENAMEX> in using the
words sweat of thy face ).  So <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan Morris</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>
are free, perhaps encouraged, to think of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>'s
labors in mythic, cosmic terms as part of post-Edenic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compulsion</ENAMEX>.

            Such convolutions of phrasal meaning (an aspect
of what some call intertextuality) is a common rhetorical
device, especially perhaps at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the arty end of</TIMEX>
journalism.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Independent</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, the same page contained not only the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> article but a review entitled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Duty and the</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beast</ENAMEX>, another in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> lambastes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX>
who has left unread those things he ought to
have read, so there can be little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> in him, and
yet another in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Quinn</ENAMEX> writes about
the gripes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX>.

            The rhyme-triggered evocation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fairy</ENAMEX> tale
Beauty and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Beast</ENAMEX>, even about a book on the
tinsel <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>, is not very rewarding,
and it seems just about as pointless to be led to the
General Confession in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglican</ENAMEX> prayer book to
evaluate a biography of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Himmler</ENAMEX>.  The punning by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Quinn</ENAMEX> is a different matter.  He is reviewing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Roth</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Deception</ENAMEX> which contrasts <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>,
and an anti-semitism in which <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> seem to connive,
with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, characterized by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> with force
... full of anger.  The contrast is strong enough to
sustain the allusion to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julia Ward Howe</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hymn</ENAMEX> (bypassing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinbeck</ENAMEX>, of course) when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinn</ENAMEX>
speaks of the narrative trampling over the now familiar
gripes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX>.  The contrast also justifies
the neat allusion to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cockney</ENAMEX> vowels
responsibly transmute the grapes of wrath and enrich
our reflections.

            Such intertextual references, whether or not
pointed by rhyme, puns, and rhythmic matching,
must indeed provide depth and enrichment if they
are not to become merely a stylistic cliché of the
scribbling classes (as they show every sign of doing
anyway).  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years</TIMEX> on and the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">daily paper</ENAMEX>:
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Independent</ENAMEX>'s arts pages in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1992</TIMEX> yielded
the following (among numerous others) over a period
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX>:


It's in the jeans ... concerning the apparently
genetic consistency of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi Strauss</ENAMEX> product
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">140 years</TIMEX>.

Pause and effect ... on the relation between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX>'s
careful timing and his continuing success
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Ceci n'est pas une critique</ENAMEX> ... a measured assessment
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Magritte</ENAMEX> exhibition in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>.

Top hat and tales ... about pop-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slash</ENAMEX> and
combining his oral memoirs with his penchant
for fancy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">headwear</ENAMEX>.

Making tracks for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elgar</ENAMEX> ... relating a renewed
interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX> to an account of how
his early recordings were made.

Hit and myth ... about a successful recording
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gluck</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orfeo</ENAMEX>.

Desert island risks ... a sneer at pulpy romance
and record programmes but with some admiration
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last century</TIMEX>'s explorers in tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>.
(The reference is to a long-running <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX>
radio interview program, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Desert Island Discs</ENAMEX>.)
            

            There is of course a very long history of such
textual duplication whereby meaning is simultaneously
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compressed</ENAMEX> and extended.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dramatists</ENAMEX> and
novelists have been especially keen to provide their
works with titles that are Janus-faced.  For Whom the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bell Tolls enabled Hemingway</ENAMEX> to look forward into
Civil <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War</ENAMEX> tragedy as well as back into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donne's Devotions</ENAMEX> .
In this instance, indeed, the impact of the
novel was so great that any reference to the quotation
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past half century</TIMEX> could not help evoking
both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX> story and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donne</ENAMEX> passage--which
was thereby given an entirely fresh
currency.

            There were striking instances of such multiple
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intertextuality</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1990</TIMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> occasion was the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centenary of Manet</ENAMEX>'s painting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia</ENAMEX>, and The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Independent</ENAMEX> (where else need I turn for material?)
ran an article on how the picture's critical reception
had changed from rejection by a scandalized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1890</TIMEX> to enthusiastic acclaim by an admiring
world in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>.  The piece bore the title The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady</ENAMEX>'s
Not for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spurning</ENAMEX>, with the reasonably obvious
meaning The subject of this painting is not to be
spurned as a disreputable whore (but enjoyed as a
sensitive portrayal).  Reasonably obvious, I say,
though we are helped if we recall that among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christopher</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fry</ENAMEX>'s other norm-defying titles ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Yard of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thor</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Sleep of Prisoners</ENAMEX> ) there
was The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady</ENAMEX>'s Not for Burning , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>.  This enforces
a passive interpretation of archaic or rustic flavor--
though it appears to be neither a quotation nor a
truly historical echo from the wretched time when
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> could suffer death at the stake for witchcraft.
All the more remarkable, then, that the article on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manet</ENAMEX> has a title that exactly matches <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fry</ENAMEX>'s in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rhythm</ENAMEX>, rhyme, and grammar, the match extending
to the curious use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> to denote in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> a
medieval wench thought to be a witch and in the
other a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> nude of dubious virtue.

            But the title could not be read in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> without
evoking another text and another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A decade</TIMEX>
earlier, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> was facing severe economic troubles and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insistent</ENAMEX> calls for a change of policy to deal with
them.  There was much talk of whether or not the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> would do a U-turn, but at the annual
conference of her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1980</TIMEX> she
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stoutly</ENAMEX> rejected any such suggestion.  In a rousing
speech, she delighted her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> with a particularly
rousing sentence: You turn if you want: the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lady</ENAMEX>'s not for turning.

            This is textually interesting in a number of ways.
It is calqued upon the title of a play that few of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> would have seen or read (significantly no
doubt the drafting of the speech seems to have involved
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Miller</ENAMEX>, himself a dramatist).  The lexical
match requires the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> to refer to herself in
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, while ingeniously seizing the opportunity--a
further intertextuality--to hint at her
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>-inspired sobriquet, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iron Lady</ENAMEX>.  But
although the sequence achieves near perfection in
prosodic matching, the grammar is hardly <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fry's:</ENAMEX>
turning is more plausibly active than passive, with
for in its familiar support-oriented role, in favor of.

            There followed numerous recyclings of this sentence
with an intertextual reference that was less
and less to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fry</ENAMEX> play and more and more to the
occasion of the conference speech.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ten years later</TIMEX>,
when Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> returned from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> meeting
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> accused
her of stubbornly refusing to heed political
trends and a change in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> public opinion.  The
Independent on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 October 1990</TIMEX> summed up this
view with the headline, The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>'s not for learning.
An even plainer link with the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> conference
came in a prominent announcement by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sky News</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1991</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> after her resignation, that Mrs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> was to appear in a major interview with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Frost</ENAMEX>, and--proclaimed the TV ad--The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lady</ENAMEX>'s not for turning off.

            A final twist.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles Kington</ENAMEX>'s column on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23 July</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> poked fun at the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX>'s current
interest in a tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> and suggested possible
slogans for advertising a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> cigarette.
They included Who would want to put a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>
out?  and The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>'s for burning.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English Loanwords in Chinese</ENAMEX>



            The spread of English words into other languages
is a process that goes on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>.  This
report details some older and some more recent
adoptions of English words into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cannon</ENAMEX> and opium plus the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United State</ENAMEX>'s open-door policy forced open the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX>'s feudal gate.  With the arrival of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX>
and foreign goods, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words began to
spread <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guanzhou</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canton</ENAMEX>)
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX>.  Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> words have entered
these dialects, the phonetic translation sometimes
being very homophonous, sometimes not.  The Cantonese
called:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cent</ENAMEX>      xian

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX>   gu
fashion   hua chen
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">stamp     shi dan</ENAMEX>

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> called:

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">chocolate   zhu gu li</ENAMEX>

            When western ideas of democracy and liberty
were imported into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> in some literature, relevant
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words were borrowed, for example:


romantic        luo man ti ke

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">international   ing</ENAMEX> te nai xang na er

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">famous writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lusun</ENAMEX> in his prose entitled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fe Er</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pe Lai Ying Gai Huan Xing</ENAMEX> used the phrase fair play ;
the title translates into <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No Fair Play Now</ENAMEX> .  Another
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xia Yian</ENAMEX>, in his novel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baoshen Gong</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contracted</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children Workers</ENAMEX> ), used Number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX>, name
wen , for the brutal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children workers</ENAMEX>.

            Of course, western science and technology exerted
great influence on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, so that some scientific
terms were borrowed into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX>.  Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">104</NUMEX>
chemical elements, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about ten</NUMEX> are direct meaning
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">translations</ENAMEX>, such as:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fe</ENAMEX>   tie
Cu   tong
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N    dan</ENAMEX>
Pb   qian
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag</ENAMEX>   yin
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg   gong</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>    qing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O    yang</ENAMEX>
C    tan
            

            The others are all sound translations, such as:


Na   na
Ca   gai
Ba   bei
Mn   meng
            

            Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> of physics are sound borrowings:


ampere    anpei
watt      wa te
Hz        hezi
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gram      ke</ENAMEX>
volt      fute
calorie   ka <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lu li</ENAMEX> or ka

            

            Some medical terms, especially the names of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX>, are borrowed directly from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
words:


aspirin      a si pi lin
analgesic    an nai jin
rutin        lu ding
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">penicillin   pan ni xi lin</ENAMEX>
atropine     a tu pin.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine      ke ka</ENAMEX> in
            

            Some scientific terms were first borrowed with
their original sounds; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>, these sound-translations
were dropped and new words were invented to
carry the meaning.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> may be more interested in the common
words popular in standard spoken <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX> language
in which there are some words directly borrowed
from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>:

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disco       di si ke</ENAMEX>

                         and weight respectively, but of the
                         same sound)
            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky Fried Chicken</ENAMEX> has changed into kente ji:
kente keeps the sound of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentu</ENAMEX>, and ji meaning
chicken, imitates the sound of ky.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> has
no sound for /<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ki</ENAMEX>/; ji is a phonetic adaptation.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MacDonald</ENAMEX>   mai ke tang na
hamburger   hanbao bao
hot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>     regou

            

            These terms are very popular in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> for the two
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> were opened there.  Even the modern
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> slang cool , excellent has become <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>: ku .
The interjection word wau (Wow!) can be
heard on radio or television.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, even
in the countryside, say bai bai to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> instead
of zai jian .

            It is interesting to note that a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>
called on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> to invite Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De</ENAMEX> and Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sai</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, de standing for democracy and sai for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science</ENAMEX> .

            Some translations are most fortuitous both in
sound and meaning: for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX>, kekou means
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tasty</ENAMEX> and kele satisfied.  Baishi kele is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi Cola</ENAMEX> ;
this translates into satisfied with everything.  There
are occasional anecdotes created around the inevitable
ambiguities that arise: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> an old country
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> heard <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> mention disco ; the old
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> thought that the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> was to kick his dog
to death, since disco sounds like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">di si kou</ENAMEX> , which
sounds like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ti si gou</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ti kick + si death + gou dog</ENAMEX>.

            Some of the borrowed words are formed with
combinations of sounds and meaning:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car       ka che</ENAMEX>: ka repeats the sound of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>,
                       and che means carriage
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">card      ka</ENAMEX> pian: ka imitates the sound; pian
                       means piece, or page, or card
carbine   kabin qiang: kabin imitates the sound
                       of combine; qiang means gun
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rifle</ENAMEX>     laifu qiang; laifu imitates the sound of
                       <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rifle</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter    baituo</ENAMEX> you: baituo imitates the sound;
                       you means <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> or grease
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer      pi jiu</ENAMEX>; pi imitates the sound; jiu means
                       wine
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaplin</ENAMEX>'s film <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Times</ENAMEX> was translated into
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Medeng Shidai</ENAMEX> , a typical example of combination
translation: medeng is a phonetic rendition of modern;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shidai</ENAMEX> means times.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX> word for
times is very old; medeng is a new word.

            In semi-colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, because of the underdevelopment
of science and technology, even some
simple products such as nails, matches, colorful
clothes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soaps</ENAMEX> had to be imported from abroad.
So even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese language</ENAMEX> was used, the
modifier yang foreign or imported had to be added:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nails     yang</ENAMEX> ding
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">matches   yang</ENAMEX> huo
oil       yang yiou
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soap      yang</ENAMEX> yizi
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cement    yang hui</ENAMEX>; (literally, foreign ash)

            

            With the development of industry, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">yang</ENAMEX> was deleted.
Now the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> do not
understand yang yizi; they know fei zao for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soap</ENAMEX> , or
xiang zao for toilet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soap</ENAMEX> .  The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> when foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oils</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shell</ENAMEX>, were dominant in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> market
has gone.  Nevertheless, in some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> novels
and films and in some spoken <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, we can hear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">yang</ENAMEX> guizi , foreign devil, a derogatory term referring
to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigner</ENAMEX>, especially from western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>,
like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Blinderman</ENAMEX>, who was
kind enough to type this article.

            In the mainland of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>, and in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> there may be different translations of
the same <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word computer
was translated into ji suan ji calculating machine, in
the mainland of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, but into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dian nao</ENAMEX> , electronic
brain in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>.  In spite of political
barriers, the academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> in the mainland of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> prefer dian nao to their original translation of
calculating machine: calculating being just one of
the several functions of computers, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s translation
is felt to be more exact.  There have been a lot
of different translations of computer terms which are
waiting for unification by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> on
both sides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> on the mainland is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ken ni di</ENAMEX>; but in Taiwan
it is gan nai <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">di</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> on the mainland is bu shi;
but in Taiwan it is bu xi .  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> is niu <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">xi lan</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>; but it is xin xi lan on the mainland.

            It is certain there will be more and more English
words coming into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vocabulary</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice</ENAMEX>-versa.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> has made many contributions to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, among them typhoon, sampan, taipan, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">silk</ENAMEX>, tong, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> as a verb, and tofu .  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
words kung fu and wok are currently in vogue in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>, whence they are likely to spread to other
English-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life & Times</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX>,

<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>.  The differences are hard
to discern, but no matter, for the book is a user-friendly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">excursion</ENAMEX> through the history of the language,
with many good examples of loanwords, derivations,
and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linguistic incunabula</ENAMEX>, curiosa, and
paraphernalia interestingly presented in a lively
fashion by a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>.  Not written for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX>,
the book makes a fine introduction to the subject

            Reaching for the Ready-Made



            As every good copywriter knows, one of the
most effective ways of drawing the attention
of newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> to a consumer advertisement
is to juggle cleverly with the shape and meaning of a
familiar idiom or set phrase.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> advertisement
for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> urged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> to Go to work
on an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>!  Go to work on can of course be interpreted
idiomatically as attack, but the presentation
also hinted wittily at the literal sense of the phrase
by portraying a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> pedaling to work on a cycle
with a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">egg-shaped</ENAMEX> wheel.  More recently, a
quality <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> has run an advertisement
for a nippy hatchback <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> under the caption A
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hardy performer</ENAMEX> wins its laurels.  This heading has
layers of meaning that can be peeled off like the
skins of an onion.  The tough little runabout has certainly
won an accolade from the motoring press.  But
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hardy performer</ENAMEX> also suggests hardy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> and, as
any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardener</ENAMEX> knows, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laurel</ENAMEX> is a shrub that survives
out of doors throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX>, just as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">maid-</ENAMEX>of-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-work <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">minicar</ENAMEX> has to fetch and carry in all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">weathers</ENAMEX>.  On another level again, we recognize the
vintage comedy performers <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Laurel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hardy</ENAMEX>--one
pretty light on his feet, the other with solider qualities.

            In advertising, almost any type of fixed expression
can be pressed into service.  Some familiar
phrases--such as go to work on --are plain idioms
with no cultural overtones.  But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laurel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardy</ENAMEX>,
like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Astaire</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogers</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodgers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hart</ENAMEX>) are
part of the history of popular entertainment in this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>.  In those examples, the popular culture is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX>: the references are understood by moviegoers
and radio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX> on both sides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>.
In other cases, the appeal is to something specifically
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> or peculiarly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, as in the ad
that referred to a popular brand of matches as The
Light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brigade</ENAMEX> and to its price as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Charge</ENAMEX>.

            Set phrases not only serve as arresting openings
and closings in advertising; they also function as
headlines in newspaper articles, quotable climaxes
in political speeches, and punch-lines in jokes, as
when a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> attending a demonstration
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> wrote:

It grew minute by minute windier and colder.
To one of the press cameramen it was a good
joke: You've got the thin blue line here all
right.

            

            Idioms are frequently fossilized metaphors: the thin
red line , which lies at the back of this piece of wordplay,
means the heroic resistance of the few against
many, and originally described a regiment of
redcoated highlanders at the battle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balaclava</ENAMEX>.  In
the puns we have been looking at, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> may
revive and extend a metaphor (portraying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>
as a small embattled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, but making them blue
with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold</ENAMEX>, as well) while at the same time changing
the form of the expression.  And as we saw with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laurel</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardy</ENAMEX> , such phrases are not only thought of
as normally fixed but are also deeply embedded in a
culture.  For this reason, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> produce a mild
shock-effect by distorting their forms or making over
their meanings.

            Fixed expressions that are open to humorous reshaping
are, of course, not always reshaped.  And
there are important types in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> that are hardly
ever adapted at all.  Consider the formulae we
regularly use to direct or punctuate the flow of conversation
and often, too, to indicate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>'s
attitude to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> addressed.  Among such formulae,
You have to be kidding! or You must be
joking!  (the first mainly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>, the second
largely <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>) are used to express skeptical dismissal
of a claim or suggestion:

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred</ENAMEX> buy a round of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>!  You must be
joking!
            

            In contrast, wholehearted agreement with an earlier
claim can be signaled by You can say that again!--
though as with You must be joking, this gambit
would only be used among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of roughly the
same age or status.  Consider this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>:

A: I wish they'd get round a table and sort the
whole thing out.

B: You can say that again!

            

            Now if A were a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX>--or an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> of
any standing--and B a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>, then B's gambit
might well seem impertinent.  I mention this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">detail</ENAMEX>--which
by the way is seldom treated in dictionaries--because
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of English we usually
have little freedom to decide how formulae are
used.  (Note, too, how in You can say that again,
the stress is always on that .)

            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> wish to convey the opposite of
what they seem to be saying on the surface, they can
do so by engineering a change of style or tone.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole Porter</ENAMEX> in the song Just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of those
Things wants to suggest the painful directness with
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy Parker</ENAMEX> might have sent a discarded
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> on his way, he switches incongruously from
plain <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> to an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elizabethan</ENAMEX> flourish:

As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy Parker</ENAMEX> once said
To her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fare</ENAMEX> thee well.

            

            Later on, he changes the direction of the stylistic
switch, and the move along the time scale, by ending
with a piece of up-to-date slang:

As <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> announced
When he knew he was bounced,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">“It</ENAMEX> was swell, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabel</ENAMEX>, swell.”

            

            But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porter</ENAMEX> is not content simply to shift to a
style that is out of keeping with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> or period.
He gives extra humor and zest to the erstwhile
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lover</ENAMEX>'s goodbye by wrapping it in a familiar set
phrase.  This is a favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porter</ENAMEX> device, used as here
in the verse but also in the title and refrain-- It was
just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of those things .  The trick is not confined
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porter</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the best-known numbers in the
Gershwin score for the movie <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">musical Shall We</ENAMEX>
Dance?  originates in a well-known formula, They
can't take that away from me, which duly appears as
the climax of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chorus</ENAMEX>.  But the last word in more
senses than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> goes to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Irving Berlin</ENAMEX>.  In a perfectly
constructed ballad of the depressed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-thirties</TIMEX> he
captures the mood of our own impoverished times
and offers his punning remedy to gloom:

Before the fiddlers have fled,
Before they ask us to pay the bill,
And while we still have a chance,
Let's face the music and dance.

            
         
         
            
We're going to pay now, or pay later.  Now, we're
paying later.  [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawton Chiles</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fla.</ENAMEX>), commenting

            Eyebrows and Lowbrows



            I once thought that most languages would have separate
words to identify and denote eyebrows, eyelids,
and eyelashes, features about as easily and objectively
observed as ears or lips.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> seemed to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bear</ENAMEX> this out with sourcil eyebrow, paupière eyelid,
and cil eyelash, although the literal sense of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sourcil</ENAMEX> (upper lash) seemed not too appropriate.
(Note also the obvious double duty of cil .)  But such
trouble as there was stemmed largely from goings-on
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> had terms for eyebrow and eyelid that
were the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> ones (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lat</ENAMEX> supercilium
and palebra ), but eyelash evidently caused trouble.
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> resorted to palpebrārum pilus
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lit</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eyelids</ENAMEX>' hair for eyelashes.  To complicate matters,
they also used the plural of eyebrow
( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">supercilia</NUMEX> ) to mean eyelashes.  And cilium , which
meant upper eyelid to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pliny the Elder</ENAMEX>, acquired in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later centuries</TIMEX> the senses of eyebrow, eyelid, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eyelash</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Körting</ENAMEX>'s Lateinisch-Romanisches
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wörterbuch</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stechert</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1923</TIMEX> repr.) glossed cilium as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eyebrow</ENAMEX>, as the only meaning (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Col. 271</ENAMEX>, No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2176</NUMEX>).
Pokorny, echoing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX>, suggested that cilium
meant the lower lid and supercilium the upper (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">553</ENAMEX>).
But supercilium meant eyebrow!

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> has inherited some of the confusion of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin</ENAMEX>.  It agrees with the ancestral tongue in sopracciglio
for eyebrow (compare Fr sourcil ) and in
palebra for eyelid (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Fr paupière</NUMEX> ).  But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ital</ENAMEX> ciglio can
mean either eyebrow or eyelash, and regional variants
complicate the picture.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portuguese</ENAMEX> has sobrancelha and palebra , in
agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>.  But for
eyelash it has pestana , matching <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> pestaña
(compare <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pestañear</ENAMEX> blink).  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spanish</ENAMEX> has ceja for
`eyebrow,' however, probably from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lat</ENAMEX> plural
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cilia</ENAMEX> .

            The purpose of this article is not primarily to establish
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etymologies</ENAMEX>--although that is partly involved--but
to note the extent to which the three
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> discussed are kept distinct (or the opposite)
in certain languages.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welsh</ENAMEX> has a word for brow
( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ael</NUMEX> ) and a word for lid ( amrant ), but, although there
is an expression meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eyelash</ENAMEX>, it is a phrase: blew
yr amrant (hair of the eyelid, reminiscent of Lat
palpebrārum pilus ).  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Breton</ENAMEX> for eyebrow,
abrant , seems akin to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welsh</ENAMEX> amrant eyelid, while
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornish</ENAMEX> abrans eyebrow is patently closer to Breton
(as is often the case).  Bret malvenn can mean eyelid
or eyelash and is probably a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> (browhair).
(Compare <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle Irish</ENAMEX> finda malach with the
same sense.)  A separate term in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Breton</ENAMEX> for eyelash
is kroc'han lagad skin of the eye.  It is easier for me
to conceive of eyelashes as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> than as skin.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goidelic Celtic</ENAMEX> does not have clearcut terms for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brow</ENAMEX>, lid, and lash either.  There is an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> mala
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eyebrow</ENAMEX> (Gaelic mala also; compare Bret malvenn ,
above) side by side with the synonymous braoi , which
may be related to or borrowed from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> brow .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> fabhra means eyelid and eyelash (and, at
times, eye).  Gaelic fabhradh appears to mean eyelash
and may share the other senses of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Irish fabhra</NUMEX> .
Gaelic rosc (alternating with rasg ) means eyelid and
eyelash, as well as eye.  (Old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> rosc meant
eye.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> clearly distinguishes Augenbraue eyebrow,
Augenlid eyelid, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Augenwimper</ENAMEX> eyelash.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scandinavian</ENAMEX> languages also show separate
terms for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English eyebrow</ENAMEX> and German
Augenbraue are matched by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swedish ögenbryn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norwegian</ENAMEX>
øyebryn , <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> øjenbryn , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Icelandic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mod</ENAMEX>.)  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">augabrún</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faroese</ENAMEX> eygnabro .  In <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danish</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norwegian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eye</ENAMEX>-hair is used for eyelashes:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swed</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ögonhår</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">øjenhår</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Icel</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">augnahár .</ENAMEX>
But <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norwegian</ENAMEX> has øyevipper for eyelash (compare
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ger Augenwimper</ENAMEX> ), and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> has, in addition to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">øjenhår</ENAMEX> , a secondary word for eyelash, øjenvipper .
For eyelid, several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scandinavian</ENAMEX> languages have
words ending with the element lok , etc. (lock,
cover, lid), for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swedish ögonlock</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">øjenlåg</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norwegian</ENAMEX> øyelokk , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faroese</ENAMEX> eygnalok .  An
old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Icelandic</ENAMEX> word hvarma eyelid persists in archaic
style in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Icelandic</ENAMEX> as well as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Faroese</ENAMEX>,
where it is in competition with eygnalok .  An Old
Icelandic kenning, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">hvarm-skógr</ENAMEX> , literally, eye-woods,
means eyelashes, as if implying that the
lashes resemble <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> lined up along the eyelid.  And
geisli hvarma, literally beam of the lids, means
eye.  Yet, apart from such figurative and poetic language,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Icelandic</ENAMEX> seems not to confuse lids and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lashes</ENAMEX>.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Welsh</ENAMEX>, there is, in addition to the primary
word for eyelid ( amrant ), a secondary expression
clawr llygad , literally, eye cover, = eyelid.  In
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Welsh</ENAMEX>, the word for brow can also mean
lid.

            There are, in various parts of the world, languages
with unambiguous designations of the three
periophthalmic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> discussed.  A sampling of
those languages follows.  The words mean, of course,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eyebrow</ENAMEX>, eyelid, and eyelash, as indicated.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ossetic</ENAMEX> has specific designations for eyebrows
and eyelashes ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ærphÿg</ENAMEX> and tsæstÿxau , respectively,
as transcribed from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyrillic</ENAMEX>).  It also distinguishes
upper eyelids ( \?<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">\ æltŭÿphal</ENAMEX> ) and lower eyelids
( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dæltiŭÿphal</ENAMEX> ).  I am not usually aware that I have
lower lids, except when something ails them, but the
Ossetes specify upper or lower lid without batting
an eyelash.  I am trying to find out whether they can
say eyelid itself, sans upper or lower.  Dictionaries
seem to offer scant help.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digor</ENAMEX> dialect (in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">west</ENAMEX> and north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ossete region</ENAMEX>) seems to
have such a separate word resembling the second
part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ossetic</ENAMEX> ones given above.  Since Ossetic
is an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> language (specifically <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranic</ENAMEX>;
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of its chief varieties is called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iron</ENAMEX>--and in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germ</ENAMEX>.  Ironisch! ), we might expect to find some
meaning in the words or their parts.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waldteufel</ENAMEX> will
hardly do as a cognate of the upper word, nor
Daredevil of the lower.  It seems that dæl - lower is
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> of words like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frisian del</ENAMEX> down, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">dale</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Church</ENAMEX> Slavic
dolŭ down, dolinŭ lower.

            This consideration of the varying ways in which
the physiological features of brows, lids, and lashes
are perceived in some languages, despite their possibility
of being objectively observed, is part of the
larger question of how the parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> are
named.  The often important factor of taboo seems
not to operate here too conspicuously, although the
superstition of the evil eye is often a potent consideration.
It may, in fact, be reflected in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish mac</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">imreasan</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupil</ENAMEX> of the eye (probably literally <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English</ENAMEX> regards lungs as a plural (at least its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> do), but <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> die <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lunge</ENAMEX> is singular.  In
some languages foot and leg are not differentiated,
note <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nog</ENAMEX> foot, leg.  <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khalkha Mongolian</ENAMEX> share that characteristic.
But, while <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> can denote <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> and hand
by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> word ( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ruká</ENAMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khalkha Mongolian</ENAMEX> have separate words for arm
and hand.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scandinavian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">languages</ENAMEX>, etc., we distinguish between fingers
and toes, physiologically and lexically.  In some languages
(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Czech</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Welsh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX>, and others) the same
word denotes both finger and toe (although it must
be remembered that when there is need to specify
that toes and not fingers are meant, or vice versa,
there are ways to do so in those languages).

            In some languages a distinction is made between
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chin</ENAMEX> and jaw, in others not.  Hair of the head
is at times called by a different word from that for
hair elsewhere on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Welsh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gwallt</ENAMEX> vs. blew ,
for example).  In <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> this difference is not found,
except possibly in medical contexts.

            We might well inquire whether a language lacking
a certain distinction (like that between eyelids
and eyelashes) also lacks other distinctions (and
shares the lacks with other languages).  Parallels are
difficult to discover, except fragmentarily.  Those
languages which show no difference in words for finger
and toe do not necessarily suffer (if that is the
right word) the lack of distinction between lid and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lash</ENAMEX>, etc.

            A high-school <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> used to give us
what he called <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> correlations, writing one
or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of them on the blackboard <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>.  He
aimed at general (maybe universal) claims and
mentioned no languages by name.  Some of his correlations
that I still recall were: Languages with an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ablative</ENAMEX> case will have no word for have .  Languages
with the same word for green and blue have
no plural nouns or adjectives.  Languages with
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than three degrees</NUMEX> of comparison of adjectives
lack words for yes and no .  Languages which do
not distinguish thumb and finger have no word for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hedgehog</ENAMEX> .  Here he was no doubt pulling our legs
(<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">or feet</NUMEX>?).

            It is possible to think of languages in which his
strangely selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correlations</ENAMEX> apply.  The first
could be <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> (a language he
had studied), the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> might be true of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Celtic</ENAMEX> language,
etc.  At any rate, he never seemed to bother
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about brows</TIMEX>, lids, and lashes, although his attitude
was sometimes supercilious.
         
         
            Dictionaries for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced Learners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Languages</ENAMEX>



            It is widely acknowledged that complaints about
missing items in the range of dictionaries required
by advanced learners and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of foreign
languages are justified to a very considerable extent.
Clearly, distinctions need to be made about the particular
first, or native language (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L1</NUMEX>) and the second
language (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L2</NUMEX>) of such learners if the above common
perception is to be substantiated.  If we are talking
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about Finns</TIMEX> attempting to learn <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Korean</ENAMEX>
then no one, surely, is going to argue that point,
except to make the observation, perhaps, that such
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hapless Finns</ENAMEX> are going to have to operate via an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interlingua</ENAMEX> (and its dictionaries), such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>.  If, on the other hand, it is a
matter of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native speakers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> grappling with
the task of acquiring a sophisticated knowledge of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German or Russian</ENAMEX>, then difficulties associated with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionaries</ENAMEX> will be of a lesser order, but there will
still be many occasions on which such learners will,
by reflex action, stretch out a hand to grab hold of a
dictionary that simply does not exist!

            A root cause of this problem is the logically reasonable
but in reality fallacious contention that what
you cannot find in a dictionary you are entitled to
find in a grammar and-- nota bene! --vice versa.  Of
course, we all know that there is a tangible overlap
between dictionaries and grammars rather than a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">no-man</ENAMEX>'s
land between them, and this in spite of their
different purposes.  Given that grammars are often
used on a systematic basis--the regularities dominate
the idiosyncrasies--grammarians write and format
them on that basis; yet grammars are also used,
exceedingly often, on a single-shot basis, a quick in
and out, just like a normal dictionary consultation.
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">learners</ENAMEX> want more than a valency pattern for a
particular verb or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of verbs or more than the
translation equivalent(s) of a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>-language
word, where do they turn?  The traditional and often
cynical-sounding counsel given to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> complaining
about this dilemma is: Go away and read
and/or listen to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty million</NUMEX> words in your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L2</TIMEX> and
you will find that the problem is diminished.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">counselor</ENAMEX>'s hope is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> will hone to
quasi-perfection a fine ability to detect, capture, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internalize</ENAMEX> information about the occurrence, co-occurrence
and patterning of lexis in context, plus a
lot else besides.  Maybe there was or is a subconscious
view that the path to L2 proficiency and success
is open only to those who can summon up the
intellectual energy and also physical, dictionary-(<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>)handling
stamina for the task.  It is a moot
point whether it is better for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> to read--
let us say--the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty million</NUMEX> running words of
text, or read the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten million</NUMEX> words twice or
even read the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five million</NUMEX> words <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times
over!  Similar questions can reasonably be asked
about the homogeneity versus heterogeneity of subject
matter and stylistic mode of this reasonably extensive
material amounting to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one hundred</NUMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred</NUMEX> and fifty average-sized books.

            Let us assume that advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> of a particular
L2 have equipped themselves with the following
reference word books: a top of the range L1→L2
and L2→L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>; a college -sized defining
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX> produced for and within their target L2
discourse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>; the best available <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L2</TIMEX> synonym
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX> and thesaurus; and a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary of proverbs</ENAMEX>
and idioms.  Ideally, they should also own their
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FL</ENAMEX> equivalent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adrian Room</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Great</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>.  If this is not available, they should start compiling
their own, on cards if necessary but ideally as a
computerized database.  They should also have access
to a large encyclopedia written in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L2</TIMEX>.  With this
back-up are they well prepared for the intricate task
of composing documents in their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L2</NUMEX> on various topics?
They are probably reasonably well prepared in
general terms but not so in particular terms.  What
they lack in terms of general lexical resources is a
collocations dictionary and a synonym differentiator,
such as --in the case of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duden</ENAMEX>'s
Die richtige <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wortwahl</ENAMEX> , which subtitles itself as a
comparative dictionary of sense-related expression.
For this aspect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L2</TIMEX> writing, incidentally, advanced
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> may
have recourse to the excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> Synonym
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.A. Rozenman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.D.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apresyan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russki Yazyk Publishing House</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>);
this compendium contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX> synonymic series, and
each article in the dictionary explains the meaning of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lexemes</ENAMEX> comprising the synonymic series, provides
a best approximation translation, and--crucially--supplies
a detailed characterization of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">similarities</ENAMEX> and differences between the synonyms,
offering at the same time an analysis of the conditions
in which each synonym is appropriate and where
they may substitute for each other.  All of this is exemplified
by belletristic citations.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced Russian-speaking</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> have available
the major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Deutsch-russisches Synonymwörterbuch</ENAMEX> , by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.V. Rakhmanov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et alii</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russki Yazyk</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>).  This
thoroughly researched and crafted reference book
contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2,500</NUMEX> entries, each representing
a synonymic series.  All items are quasialigned
with translation equivalents and are illustrated
by example sentences--not citations--in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, which are also given in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> translation.
The front matter of both of these dictionaries from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> includes substantial theoretical essays on the
theory of synonymy and on the lexicographic practicalities
of arraying and presenting synonyms in dictionary
format.

            It is clear that collocations dictionaries and
synonym differentiators may not exist at all in a
particular language <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>: in fact, very few
language <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> can boast of such resources.
That is a great pity because that is exactly what advanced
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">learners</ENAMEX> need.  In fact, it is not stretching
things too much to say that first-class collocational
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> is the hallmark of the true L2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX>; collocational
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> is normally the last linguistic subsystem
to be mastered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">learners</ENAMEX> who proceed to
an advanced level.  Correct deployment of collocations
is particularly important for anyone striving for
authenticity of performance within a particular professional
sociolect, such as the language of medicine
or economics.

            No one could claim that it is an easy task to create
collocations dictionaries: the chief problem is
where to draw the proverbial line on a spectrum
ranging from complete predictability, usually on a
left-to-right basis, to total volatility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> by
mere juxtaposition, for example, corned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX> v.
cheap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX> .  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictionary maker</ENAMEX>'s job is to capture
the habitualisms without overloading the dictionary
with items which are putatively valid enough in
absolute terms by not in the statistical sense of significance
derived via measurable co-occurrence.

            It has to be admitted that there are far too few
collocations dictionaries around.  In the English-speaking
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary microcosm The Oxford Thesaurus</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>), has clearly stolen a march over all its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX> in terms of size, structure, and depth of treatment.
Synonym differentiation was evidently--and
rightly--seen as a crucial task and the thoroughness
with which this task was carried out is one the dictionary's
most important assets.  In fact, the provision
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> example for each sense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> within an
entry is an innovative and pragmatically satisfactory
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> of hinting at the possibility and permissibility of
collocation with other words a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, whose native
language is not <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, may have in mind at the
moment of consultation.  Useful though that is, the
best-known genuine collocations dictionary for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>--probably,
however, only until the publication
of the seriously delayed Words in Use compilation
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cobuild</ENAMEX> stable--is undoubtedly the BBI
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Combinatory Dictionary</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M. Benson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E. Benson</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Ilson</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benjamin</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>).  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> other notable
dictionaries come from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Selected English Collocations</ENAMEX> ,
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. Dzier</ENAMEX>anowska and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Kozlowska</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWN Warsaw</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2nd ed., 1988</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> Adverbial
Collocations , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Kozlowska</ENAMEX> (PWN <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>).  [See p. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>.]  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Great Britain</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cobuild</ENAMEX> Collocations
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> is eagerly awaited.

            A quite remarkable and innovative dictionary is
now about to appear in revised, updated, and enlarged
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-edition: this is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.I. Ubin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> lexical intensifiers (Russki
Yazyk, orig. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pub</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>).  In essence, this is a versatile
two-way bilingual (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian English</ENAMEX>) collocation
dictionary providing information about how to intensify,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heighten</ENAMEX>, or escalate the basic meanings
of nouns on the one hand, and verbs and adjectives
on the other, by qualifying them with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adjectives</ENAMEX> and adverbs, respectively.  The dictionary's
structure is quadripartite with appropriate
cross-referencing, linkage, and metalinguistic information.
Each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> halves
has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sections: the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> comprises the alphabetically
ordered listing of the intensificands, each of
which constitutes a dictionary entry.  To each intensificand
is appended a translation equivalence
and an alphabetic list of permissible intensifiers.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> section consists of an alphabetically ordered
inverted list of intensifiers, alongside each of
which is a list of those intensificands which it can
modify.  Altogether, the dictionary yields some
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collocations</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 12,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collocations</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A. Reum</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Dictionary of English Style</ENAMEX> , republished
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hueber</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX> but dating back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>,
was intended by its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> as a reference work
which would allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> to formulate their ideas in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> yet express them in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, using typically
English modes of thought and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linguistic templates</ENAMEX>.
The same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> is noteworthy for his Petit Dictionnaire
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Style</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1911</TIMEX>) which offers <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>
an open sesame to authentic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.  This handbook
was conceived as a linguistic guide which would
somehow prevent its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> from grabbing hold of a
German→French dictionary the moment their personal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vocabulary</ENAMEX> ran out.

            Collocations dictionaries published in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">advanced</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L2</ENAMEX> learners of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> date back a quarter
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century or so</TIMEX> and have developed a very high
degree of variety and sophistication over the intervening
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.  The afore-mentioned variety extends,
for instance, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">learner</TIMEX>'s dictionaries of collocations
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> for specific purposes) areas
as disparate as agriculture, materials science, and sociopolitical
discourse.  The main general collocations
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slovar</ENAMEX>' sochetaemosti slov russkogo
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">yazyka Russian Word-combinatory Dictionary</ENAMEX>), by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.N. Denisov</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V.V. Markovkin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russki Yazyk</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>).  Such is the depth of the lexicographical
treatment that the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>, whilst containing only
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</NUMEX> articles, occupies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">685</NUMEX> pages!

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> the nearest thing to a straight collocations
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E. Agricola</ENAMEX>'s regularly republished
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wörter und Wendungen</ENAMEX> , written for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>
but highly valuable for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> at an
advanced level.  It is, however, worth examining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Becker</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stilwörterbuch</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leipzig</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964-66</TIMEX>).  Although
containing a mere <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">couple of hundred</NUMEX> entries
or so, the dictionary is valuable by virtue of the depth
of treatment and the ramifications of the information
supplied.

            Mention needs to be made, finally, of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other
publication from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. Erk</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zur Lexik</ENAMEX> wissenschaftlicher
Fachtexte, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Vols. 4, 5, & 6</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hueber</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972-82</TIMEX>).  Its aim is to provide frequency data and
modes of use of the basic vocabulary of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> academic
discourse.  The value of this work is diminished
by the fact that the citations given are merely
sub-sentence fragments from the corpus, which was
assembled for the frequency study itself, thus denying
users the opportunity to make full use of this
important data.

            This last point opens the door for a plea, or at
least a statement of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">desideratum</ENAMEX> perceived by advanced
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L2s</ENAMEX> and by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>.
Notwithstanding the logistic difficulties of constructing
synonym differentiators and collocations dictionaries,
particularly the latter, it is now possible
for information technology to deliver direct to socalled
end-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> lexical data retrieval systems of
great size, power, and usefulness.  Any doubting
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomases</ENAMEX> should make arrangements to view and
use the CD-ROM implementations of dictionaries
from such famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford University</ENAMEX>
Press, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Langenscheidt</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> of
these lines believes that the CD-ROM implementation
of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Le Grand Robert</ENAMEX> , for instance, is not only a paragon
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dictionary</ENAMEX> content but of navigation software
and of the retrieval tools provided.  What advanced
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of various L2s need, by comparison, is ridiculously
simple: they need a lexical data retrieval system--is
this sophisticated enough to deserve the
term lexical database?  --which will allow them to
enter a search word of interest, either from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> or
L2, and view nothing more than an arbitrarily chosen
number of underlying corpus citations relating
to one target-language lexeme, so that they can
get a feel for its semantic range and combinatory-collocatory
possibilities.  Of course, they should be
able to choose how many citations, what language
level they come from etc.  They should also be able
to operate various controls to refine search strategies;
still, when all is said and done, all they want is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authentic</ENAMEX> citations and authentic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">collocations</ENAMEX>.

            The main benefit of having such a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> is to
accelerate learning and growth of confidence by dint
of exposure to much more and much better focused
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linguistic</ENAMEX> material.  All of this is so easy from the technological
point of view--how does it look from the
commercial angle?  Responses or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ripostes</ENAMEX> awaited!

someone might say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mai ap ko batati hum</ENAMEX>, he is a
very reliable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> , where the opening words are
Hindi for I tell you.  This time, the mélange is
called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hindlish</ENAMEX>.  A similar statement in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>
could be This morning I hantar my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby tu</ENAMEX> dekat
babysitter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tu lah</ENAMEX> , in which the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and second <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> mean took and to the, and the particle
lah shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> and hearer are socially close.
Finally, on the other side of the world, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latino</ENAMEX> on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> border might observe, with a shrug,
Sometimes I'll start a sentence in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English y</ENAMEX> terminó en
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">español</ENAMEX> .  And this time the mix is known as Spanglish
or Tex-Mex.

            Such hybridization is all the rage on every continent
in the world and shows no sign of letting up.
It is so common that many jokey and dismissive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blends</ENAMEX> formed on - lish have almost become technical
terms.  Among them are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arablish, Chinglish</ENAMEX>,
Frenglish, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gerlish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutschlish, Italglish</ENAMEX>, Janglish
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japlish, Russlish</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yinglish</ENAMEX> .  The complex and
fluid developments in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>, between
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> other languages, have been
labeled in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX> ingeniously pejorative ways,
as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurolish, Eurospeak, Desperanto</ENAMEX>, and Minglish
(the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> also used to denote and deride Common
Market bureaucratese, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> to catch the
confusion that can arise among simultaneous translators).

            Although picturesque labels like these indicate
both amusement and anger among those who use
them, they do not match the scale of what is happening.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hybrids</ENAMEX> they denote may be mocked, denounced,
enjoyed, or ignored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, linguists,
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, but regardless of censure or praise
they just steamroller on.  Vast and utterly pragmatic,
they are used as freely by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purists</ENAMEX> who condemn
them (when they relax) as by those who simply go
with the flow.  The hybridization of English with innumerable
other languages on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> basis is a
product of necessity and one of the most remarkable
developments in communication that has ever taken
place.  Many have written on whether <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> will
supplant other languages, but few have considered
whether <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> (among other things) is simply going
to merge with many of them, for certain purposes
at least.

            This miscegenation is of course what has always
happened when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> comfortable in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> languages
use them freely in their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> affairs.  In the
heat of the moment, expressions in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> language
come more quickly to the tongue than expressions in
the other--and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> may never be sure at any
time which will provide the next word, phrase,
clause, or sentence.  In an important sense, such
mixers do not have just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> systems, A and B, to
work with, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>: a spectrum of A, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX>
This universal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quartet</ENAMEX> of possibilities is nicely reflected
in such current sets of labels as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>--
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frenglish</ENAMEX>--franglais--français in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quebec</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>--
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taglish</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engalog</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Tagalog</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spanglish</ENAMEX>--englañol--espanol in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rico</ENAMEX>.

            In general terms, when bilinguals are talking
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Language</ENAMEX> A alone, they stay pretty
well inside A, and the same with B.  But when they
are together, and especially if they constitute a large
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>, they splice the contents of their languages
into new and often unpredictable patterns;
this happened in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> when Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman French</ENAMEX> came together after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1066</TIMEX>, giving
rise to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hybrid</ENAMEX> that was in due
course used to such effect by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaucer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malory</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is now Language <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">A</ENAMEX> or B in the repertoire
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> throughout the world.  These versatile
bilinguals are at least as significant for the future
of the language as the more or less unilingual communities
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>; indeed,
they may be more significant because they outnumber
the unilinguals.  In such <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigeria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mixers</ENAMEX> are already key figures in the shaping
of national usage.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilingual</ENAMEX> and multilingual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> are often the product (in part at least)
of colonial pasts, as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, but not always: they can also be the outcome
of simple proximity, as when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican Spanish</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX> come intimately together in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> supermarket:

            It is a venerable truism that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> has long
been a mongrel tongue with a hybrid heritage.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Writers</ENAMEX> about the language routinely describe and
illustrate its ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> for picking up bits and
bobs from all kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Zulu</ENAMEX>.
From time to time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> have debated whether
Modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> should be listed not just as a Germanic
language, but in lexical terms as a Romance
language--in effect as a hybrid that is now spinning
off further <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hybrids</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Hindi</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> (or, informally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japlish</ENAMEX>) is
an intriguing case because of the economic prominence
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, the relative <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-sidedness at present
of the flow of words, and the restrictedness of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>,
a language little used outside the home islands.
Since immediately after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, the massive
inflow of English words has represented modernity
and internationalization.  Many <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of items
in contemporary urban <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> usage are adapted
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words, nativized by reshaping their syllabic
patterns into forms that can be written in katakana
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">symbols</ENAMEX> and pronounced without difficulty.

            Specimens of this virtually machinelike process
include erekutoronikkusu electronics, kurisumasu
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>, and purutoniumu <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plutonium</ENAMEX>.  Words
with sounds that are not present in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> are
given the best local fit, as in takushi <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX>, rabu
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">love</ENAMEX>, and basu both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> and bath.  Some loanwords
undergo a semantic shift, as with manshon
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">high-class</ENAMEX> apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> (from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> ), konpanion
female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> or hostess (from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> ),
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">baikingu buffet meal</ENAMEX>, smorgasbord (from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vi-king</ENAMEX> ).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clippings</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blends</ENAMEX> are common, such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terebi</ENAMEX> television, masukomi mass communication,
and wapuro word processor.  <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words also
sometimes combine with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> words, as for example
haburashi toothbrush, from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> ha
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tooth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> brush .  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> or more words from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English</ENAMEX> also sometimes come together in new ways,
as with pureigaido (play guide) a ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bakkumira</ENAMEX> (back mirror) a rear-view mirror.  In
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> such indigenous coinages are wryly referred
to as wasei eigo Made-in-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> English.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> have for some time been quietly
returning the compliment.  The number of loans is
low and almost entirely in the field of commercial
names, but their impact has been out of all proportion
to those numbers.  A common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formula</ENAMEX> is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-word
phrase that opens with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> company
name and closes with a product name that is genuinely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western</ENAMEX>, as with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ballade</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX>
Colt , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corolla</ENAMEX> , or that echoes such a word,
as with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda Acura</ENAMEX> (accurate?), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sentra</ENAMEX>
(central, sentry?), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan Micra</ENAMEX> (a feminization
of micro ).  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> capacity to produce
decorative off-beat <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> has been widely noted
for some time, as in this comment from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>:

The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> long ago mastered the process of
labeling their consumer goods to appeal to a
global market.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walkman</ENAMEX> may be a piece of fractured
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, but the term has become as generic
and widely recognized as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX>.

--The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Japanese Naming Game</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 13</TIMEX>
            

            The term <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Walkman</ENAMEX> is on a par with the atmosphere
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English</ENAMEX> found on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> T-Shirts, bags,
and pencil boxes, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenderness</ENAMEX> was completed
a pastel and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York City Theatre District</ENAMEX> is
where you can and us, anyone .  Such novel (mis)uses
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, as tokens of modernity rather than as
normal messages, are now widespread in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Asia</ENAMEX>
and elsewhere.  How long it will remain a standard
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> practice and an international fad is anybody's
guess.  But regardless of how decorative English
develops, it seems likely that a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> input
into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>--whatever forms it takes--will steadily
increase in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-first century</TIMEX>, not stay the
same or diminish.

            Although the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hybrids</ENAMEX> are currently
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unstable</ENAMEX>, the hybridity itself is stable enough.
It has been running for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Africa</ENAMEX>
and appears to have many more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> to run.  If
past situations are anything to go by, those languages
affected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> will undergo irreversible
change, as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> did after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">invasions</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Conquest</ENAMEX>.  Malay by government design
and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> by casual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">osmosis</ENAMEX> are already indelibly
marked by borrowings (including what <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> took
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> times from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>).  The
outcome is far from clear, but it can hardly be minor,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> will be affected in ways that we can
hardly imagine.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humor Caribbean Style</ENAMEX>



            There is no <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> on earth that does
not have its own style of humor, hence the
proliferation of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> jokes, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> jokes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
jokes, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> jokes, etc.  Humor is defined in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> as that quality of action, speech, or writing
which excites amusement and in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWIII</ENAMEX> as that
expression of ideas in a happening, an action, a situation,
or an expression of ideas which appeals to a
sense of the ludicrous or absurdly incongruous.  We
all know the highly beneficial effects of laughter on
our physical, mental, and emotional well-being.
Luckily for us <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caribbeans</ENAMEX>, humor plays a great part
in our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> lives and laughter is generally much
more common than a gloomy face.  Perhaps this is
related to our down-to-earth, often rather unsophisticated
use of language, especially at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> level.

            A few examples (from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lexicography Project</ENAMEX>) illustrate how our use of
language translates into laughter.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX> a certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>-of-the-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> councillor
in an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Caribbean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> (now independent;
it shall remain nameless) could not bear the
thought of any kind of expenditure by the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX>,
apart from that on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> and water-supply, the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> that he had faithfully promised his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX>.
When the question of money for urinals
came up, our redoubtable councillor, in typical fashion,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">loudly</ENAMEX> and vehemently abjected to spendin' the
poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> money on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dese urinals</ENAMEX>!   So persistent
and determined was his blocking of the vote that it
spurred another councillor to take him aside and explain
what a urinal was.  In he came again, gesticulating
vigorously, to deliver this piece in support of a
change of vote:


Why y'all didn't put de thing in praper terms?
Yes!  Yes!  I vote for them.  And while you buildin'
you must put in some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arsenals</ENAMEX> too!
            

            The concept of a plain-clothes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX> is familiar
to most, but don't be so sure in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>:
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX> who is not in proper unformed dress is
simply not dressed, as one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> saw it in this
newspaper report of her testimony in court:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheryl</ENAMEX> also claimed that among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> were a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St Michael landlord</ENAMEX>, a uniformed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX> and
others who she believed were undressed police
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>.
            

            But if such superficial use of words suggests that
their humor is hidden from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> concerned,
it would be a mistake to take that as normal.  More
often, there is a deliberateness in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>'s purpose to ridicule: A well-dressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strutting</ENAMEX> along on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> in rags notices her rather bony legs, so
he levels her with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>, you ain' 'fraid hungry
dog see you?  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> with noticeable steatopygia
may be specially greeted in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the middle of the morning</TIMEX>
or in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> with Oh good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">AFTERnoon</TIMEX>!  A
teenager wearing a neat pair of trousers, probably
hand-me-downs since they are much too short--so
short that he would not need to pull them up to walk
through <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>--evokes the arch query from his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">peers</ENAMEX>, You expecting flood?

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> experience often thrusts itself
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Eurocentric</ENAMEX> world view that has been superimposed
by schooling or by everyday circumstances.
For example, a common language exercise
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> is to ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to complete well-known
proverbial sayings like those below: each is followed
by the completions given in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> school
(as collected over a period of time by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>).


A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> in the hand will mess on your clothes.
One swallow does not make a meal.
You can't teach an old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> so don't waste your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>.
Penny wise is too far from dollar wise.
            

            In similar vein, there is a profusion of picturesque
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metaphors</ENAMEX> and similes framed in local experience
as is illustrated in the following examples:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rice</ENAMEX> dog or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heinz</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> a mongrel.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pond</ENAMEX>-fly of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> a promiscuous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flits</ENAMEX> around distributing her favors with premeditated
and predatory intent.

yard-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fowl</ENAMEX> a political sycophant or one who
gives allegiance to the political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> in power
with a view to any pickings that he or she might
receive.

banana-jockey a poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who would cadge
a ride on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX>-producing islands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>.

bag-blind bastard (derogatory and offensive) a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> so poor that he or she lives in the meanest
of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwellings</ENAMEX> with only empty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>-bags for curtains
(blinds as they are also known in the

            In a slightly different category is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Afro-Caribbean</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> of words who flourishes, particularly at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> level, immensely enjoying word-use as an
exercise--even a challenge.  He uses standard English
word-formation devices in order to create new
words with broad sensory connotations, such as
foodist, bellyologist , and groggist to refer to people
with uncontrolled appetites, dedicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drinkers</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eaters</ENAMEX>.

            The inventiveness of such word-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> may also
be uncontrolled, a feature of which little account has
been taken in analyzing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> language use, the
display of diction practised by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly men</ENAMEX> on
such festive occasions as christenings and weddings,
especially the latter.  In most <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> in
former times, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in a few rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> of the art of such diction were
sought out and specially invited so as to give status
to the ceremony at the wedding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>.  The following
is a sample of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such speech:


Lordly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> and magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX>, I
come on the gijantic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wings</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Archangel Gabriel</ENAMEX>
to expaterate the absolutely right-minded
eucharistic blessings upon you-all proceedings
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this evening</TIMEX>.  Primarily I was entranced at the entrance
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Magna Carta</ENAMEX> appearance of
Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bridegroom</ENAMEX> and the celestial and capital incorporated
specifications of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mrs Bride</ENAMEX>.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> for all that and what a piece of work is man
and God saw fit that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> should not be without
his keepmate and took out his ribs to make his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.  Do not let any bumptious, presumptious,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">officious</ENAMEX>, malicious or contentious reactionary socialist
come between you and interfere to counteract
the felicitary interprications of your marriage
bed.  Distolerate him!  Ostracize, cauterize
and excise him!  What a piece of work is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>!  Do
not hesitate to generate and add exhilaration to
our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.

...

And now to Him that giveth and taketh away
and doeth exceeding great good to all that loveth
Him and doeth his will willy-nilly, may the words
of my mouth and the meditations of mine heart
be acceptable to all of you and to both of you this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">day</ENAMEX> and henceforth forever, Amen.
            
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX>



            My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> is a born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disciplinarian</ENAMEX>, and
language annoys him no end.  He feels that,
as a type of mechanism, any language ought to have
a predictable regularity.  A lot of built-in irregularities
are merely inefficient.  A proper language
should click along like a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> watch, doing its job in
a no-nonsense way.  As a native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> has a difficult time.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English</ENAMEX> has rules--
some fairly regular rules--but too many exceptions.
Those aren't exceptions I tell him, there are subrules.
He glares at me, sneaky deceiver.  I am not
getting away with that one.

            Recently <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> got hold of a book on Sanskrit
and has been chewing away firmly at it.  That is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> a language ought to be!  I remind him that there
is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taj Mahal</ENAMEX>--and that is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>.  The mass
of humanity have to live in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>.  Some hovels too,
and caves and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tents</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> are relatively few.  Languages
built to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX>' specifications are artificial
and largely remain unspoken.  Some are even unspeakable.
If a language is to reflect what goes on in
the mind, it must have a lot of flexibility, tolerance,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluency</ENAMEX>.  The language genius exploits this flexibility
and fluency--and makes the best of it.  The language
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> learned fixes itself deeply in memory in
the fabric of the mind.  It becomes normal: it is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">idiolect</ENAMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> of thought unique to each
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, the basic layer.  One is seldom aware of it,
but it is still there underneath.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX>'s language
as he learned it in infancy is fixed.  He does not see it
as a set of rules; it is simply there and he resents
tampering with it.  Then he has another set of rules
derived from his high-school <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>, Miss
Martinet, about double negatives, final prepositions,
and other unquestionables that have an aura of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount Sinai</ENAMEX>.  Sometimes he sees me as a golden calf.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> feels that language should be strictly
logical.  He carries around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Occam</ENAMEX>'s razor--it is his
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> army <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">knife</ENAMEX>.  He has a sharp eye for any kind of
redundancy, even when used deliberately for emphasis
or to make a distinction or sense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>.  A
rose is a rose is a rose --so why say it <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times?
There is no need for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow-woman</ENAMEX> as long as we
have the word widower .  The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> man who
speaks of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">viper snake</ENAMEX> ought to know that vipers are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX> and we do not need to be told so.  And when
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> go swimming in the raw, of course they are bare
and they are naked, so why bare-naked?  They are
not naked unless they are totally bare.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bare</ENAMEX> should
mean totally too.  Why insist?  Excitement, enthusiasm,
are always messing up logic.  Also messing up
the language.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> has working in his office an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Englishwoman</ENAMEX>
who he thinks, having been born <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>,
should have more respect for the language.  She is
an exuberant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, and it shows.  I rather like her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spontaneity</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> finds it hard to take.  At
office parties she finds the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> frightfully tasty or
dreadfully nice, and when they are covered with
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">whipped cream</ENAMEX>, they can be sinfully delicious.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> cannot resist her--he has a sweet
tooth that forever betrays him--but he finds her
oxymoronic style hard to bear.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxymorons</ENAMEX> in general,
he says, are well named, and he is against them.
But he is not beyond a grumbling pun on oxen and
morons , while looking hard at me.  I have challenged
him with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX>'s line of the pun as the lowest form
of wit, but he says not if they are appropriate.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> suspects great and dangerous social
forces underlying changes in the use of words.  Not
long ago he had a running horror at what had happened
to the word awful .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton</ENAMEX>, he says, had it
right, the way it should properly be: full of awe,
awe-inspiring, an awful God .  But in our populist
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> with too many <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at large,
awful has become etiolated.  (Nice word--one of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">favorites</ENAMEX>.)  And awesome seems now to
have gone the same way--among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX>, at least,
a raw, brainless lot.  I grant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX> their last
fling of childish freedom before adulthood begins to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">descend</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> matured earlier than I; my occasional
lapses into juvenility pain him.  He is generally
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">forgiving</ENAMEX>: he still has hopes for me.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX>'s objections come not only in matters
of logic--there is a moral tinge to them sometimes.
He is against what seems deception, self-contradiction
in public speech-making.  He finds it insidious.
In its linguistic form, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> introduces his
subject by saying, To this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> I need not
explain..., then goes on and explains it.  To <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX>
this is a kind of hypocrisy: flattering the audience
by pretending they know something already
when he feels pretty sure they do not.  To tease him
I recently made a list of such phrases: It goes without
saying..., I hardly need to point out..., It
should be unnecessary to note that..., I will not insist
on the point, but if I did... And there are others,
old-timers such as Far be it from me to claim... .
My list only put <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> into a dismal mood.

            I chatter about the psychology of speech-making,
catching and keeping an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>'s attention,
but it does not impress him.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Audiences</ENAMEX> should
need no flattery.  Give them the facts, the truth, no
soft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soap</ENAMEX>, and that should be enough.  I insist on the
need to repeat, to emphasize, even to exhort.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Audiences</ENAMEX>
appreciate a bit of verbal legerdemain.  Will
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rogers</ENAMEX> knew it, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnum</ENAMEX> before him, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antony</ENAMEX> before them.  To <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> it all reflects
on the shameful gullibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX> and the
amorality of language, which should be at least logically
pure, if also, unfortunately, anybody's strumpet
otherwise.

            I have pleaded with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> about the right of
language to an occasional <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holiday</TIMEX>--to have a bit of
fun.  He admits the pleasure of a good pun--not a
false or missed pun, or a too obvious, witless pun,
but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that activates a mental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Leyden jar</ENAMEX>.  But he
feels uncomfortable with the imitative uses of language,
which often seem primitive and trivial.  Ono-matopeias,
especially--the old bow-wow theory
of language origin--it is too obvious and too limited:
oral noises, not language.  Even when they become
conventionalized, echoic words are suspect.  They
are baby talk, purely <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>.  They are not language
until they are elaborated, until they develop rules,
system.  I do not think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> has ever seen a small
child break the single-word language barrier and get
hold of syntax, a fundamental breakthrough in language
learning.  He favors a sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Athenian</ENAMEX> approach:
language bursts full-armored from the brow
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jove</ENAMEX>.

            He should follow a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s language learning,
not sternly but curiously.  It might impress him to
hear the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> regularize our odd plurals, with mans
and gooses and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lifes</ENAMEX> , a sub-rule which he has to swallow
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">willy-nilly</ENAMEX>.  And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s imitative words and
the noises they make, the words they invent as they
play with their vocal apparatus and explore the possibilities
of the language.  Not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> alone, but
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> rolling on their tongues such wondrous inventions
as discombobulate and goloptious and humongous --fun-words
for special occasions, word play.
If all the world were playing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holidays</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX>
quotes, and blows the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">umpire</ENAMEX>'s whistle.  He enjoys
enforcing rules: you do not have a game without
rules. I agree, and add that rules have to be revised
from time to time, not always on grounds of theory,
but of experience learned in play.  The thing to
avoid is rigidity.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> sniffs and tilts his chin.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> bears with my frivolous ways, for we
have been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>.  I find myself inventing
words from time to time and even getting
them into print when they slip past weary or tolerant
copy-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>, perhaps even on their merits.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obviable</ENAMEX> is one of these beauties, and brainworm is
another.  I know I made them up all new, though
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lexicographers</ENAMEX> might already have registered them.
They just seem to come out naturally to fill a place
where nothing else would quite do.  I have not
boasted of them to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> but perhaps I should set
up a subtle test--slip them over on him, not as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>,
and see the effect.  One might pass on the flavor of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latinism</ENAMEX>.  But I shall never risk any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">syntactic</ENAMEX> experiments
on him.  Not even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s renown and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grace</ENAMEX> is dead or that cannot be so neither would
get by.  Nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton</ENAMEX>'s airy tongues that syllable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s names.  I can hear him declaring firmly,
Nouns are nouns and should not be wrenched into
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">verbs</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southey</ENAMEX>'s now no respite, neither by day
nor night, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s neither search nor labour are
necessary, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chesterfield</ENAMEX>'s others speak so fast and
sputter that they are not to be fully understood neither--are
all blunders.  They flout logic.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jefferson</ENAMEX>'s
claim of unalienable rights in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Declaration</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Independence</ENAMEX> is, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX>, an egregious example
of miscegenation, where a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> word is joined
to an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Anglo-Saxon</ENAMEX> prefix.  The fact that unalienable
had existed alongside inalienable for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a century</TIMEX>
is no excuse.  I quote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, what boots it
with uncessant care....  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, indeed, says
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX>.

            Some time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> is in a lugubrious
mood and we are telling sad stories of the death of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kings</ENAMEX>, I am going to propose, for his tombstone,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, with all thy faults, I loved thee still.  For
mine I can imagine him coming up with something
like, A good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, apart from his too easy tolerance.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Word Watchers</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fitzedward Hall</ENAMEX>



            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fitzedward Hall</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1825-1901</TIMEX>) traced his career
as an etymologist to a shipwreck.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Son</ENAMEX> of a prosperous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Troy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall</ENAMEX> completed his
studies in engineering at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rensselaer</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1842</TIMEX> and was
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time--from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard College</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1846</TIMEX>--when his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> sent him on an errand.
A younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, inexplicably drawn by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dana</ENAMEX>'s
grim novel <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two Years</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mast</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1840</TIMEX>), had run
away to a life of adventure at sea, and their father
ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fitzedward</ENAMEX> to bring him home.

            Soon thereafter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> found himself a castaway
at the mouth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ganges</ENAMEX>, and he chose to remain,
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calcutta</ENAMEX>, where he became a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>.  Drawn to the study of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> languages, he
rose to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanskrit</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government College</ENAMEX>,
Benares, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1850</TIMEX>, and commenced a career as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanskrit</ENAMEX> texts, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> to
do so.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1857</TIMEX>, he took an armed part in the suppression
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sepoy</ENAMEX> uprising and then rewarded
himself with a vacation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
While he was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Dwight</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitney</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s preeminent orientalist, did all
that he could to persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall</ENAMEX> to remain at home,
but he could not prevail.  On his way back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> awarded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> an honorary doctorate in recognition
of his contribution to oriental learning.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1862</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> to spend the rest of his
life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX>'s campaign to find him an
appointment at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> continued but with diminished
chances of success.  In a letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles Eliot</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norton</ENAMEX>--like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis James Child</ENAMEX>, a member
of the class of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'46</NUMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitney</ENAMEX> wrote resignedly,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anyhow</ENAMEX>, one takes a kind of wicked satisfaction in
seeing that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> has to come even to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> for
her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> in that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Oriental</ENAMEX> study
which it is most her duty and interest to cultivate.
On settling at last in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> was appointed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanskrit, Hindi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> jurisprudence
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>.  In short order, he
was made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">librarian</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiner</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> languages for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil Service Commissioners</ENAMEX>.
He continued the duties of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiner</ENAMEX> even
after his retirement in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1869</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marlesford, Suffolk</ENAMEX>,
when he completed his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanskrit</ENAMEX> editing.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belatedly</ENAMEX>,
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> awarded him an honorary doctorate
and was rewarded by the bequest of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manuscripts</ENAMEX> and editions.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>'s philological career had another side, one
of special interest to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>.  As far
back as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1838</TIMEX>, he wrote, I began the practice,
which I have kept up ever since, of desultorily jotting
down notes on points of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  (He was then a
mere philological stripling of thirteen.)  Not until
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1872</TIMEX>, however, did he compile these notes into book
form, a volume with the splendid title, Recent Exemplifications
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">False Philology</ENAMEX> .  In it, he attacked vigorously
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> worthies well-known for their opinions
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Savage Landor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas De</ENAMEX>
Quincey, and (lengthily) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Grant White</ENAMEX>.  All
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> were inclined to uninformed etymology or ignorant
censure, he alleged.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern English</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1873</TIMEX>), he harassed other self-proclaimed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>,
and, in both books, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> lines of text
float above a dense mass of footnotes in tightly set <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-point
type.  By this method, he ensured that no claim
would stand without supporting evidence.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>'s authority came from his citations, a mass
so large that desultorily can hardly describe the
intensity of his collecting.  Before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> , no one
could have easily located examples to dispute him,
though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richardson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> (as revised by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Todd</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Latham</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> (as revised by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodrich</ENAMEX>) all
gave historical usages.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> was immeasurably better
informed than those he criticized, and he recognized
that a trustworthy dictionary must be founded on
examples--a thing never to be expected, save as the
result of extensive cooperation, and judicious subdivision
of labour.  Naturally enough, he was soon
recruited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Murray</ENAMEX> as a collaborator in the
preparation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> .  In the preface to the first
volume of that great dictionary, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray</ENAMEX> thanked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>
expansively for his voluntary and gratuitous service:
Those who are familiar with the pages of his
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Modern English</ENAMEX> , his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> Adjectives in -able
[<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1877</TIMEX>], and his numerous articles and papers on special
points of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, know with what an amazing
wealth of evidence the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> illustrates the history
of every word, idiom, or grammatical usage, upon
which he touches.  In the preface to volume <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Murray</ENAMEX>
declared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX> his death is an incalculable
loss, a loss that would indeed have been irreparable
but for the fact that he left directions that
all his ms. quotations, references, notes, and memoranda,
should be handed over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX>, and that
we should have the free use of the books in his own
extensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> to which these referred.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> was
similarly generous in opening his collections to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joseph</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> (for the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">English Dialect Dictionary</ENAMEX> ) and
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> engaged in the preparation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Century Dictionary</ENAMEX> .

            Like many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> grew increasingly conservative
as he aged, but his allegiance to usage as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> of judgments about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> remained
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>.  In particular, he was suspicious of language
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformers</ENAMEX> who wished to revive or fabricate Anglo-Saxon
synonyms for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latinate</ENAMEX> words.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Masses</ENAMEX> of
older <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, he thought, had no more chance of
revival than water-clocks and tinderboxes.  In a
sentence intended to poke fun at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saxonists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall</ENAMEX>
declared: Our lingual hybridism is ineradicable.
Romantic yearnings for an imaginary past were, to
him, anathema, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> of many kinds
were early subject to his critical strictures: The
rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> [the conservative] has gradually grown
used, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">long years</TIMEX> of disquietude, to hear talked
of, without apprehension of catalepsy; but you must
wait for his son, or for his son's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, if you would get
a candid hearing for the rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.

            Despite his long residence abroad, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> was self-consciously
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> and, latterly, all too ready to
cede authority to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> in matters of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
Toward the end of his life, he wrote: If egotism for
a moment is pardonable, no false shame deters me
from avowing that, though I have lived away from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> upwards of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX>-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX>, I feel, to this
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX>, in writing <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, that I am writing a foreign
language, and that, if not incessantly on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX>, I
am in peril of stumbling.  What a pained admission
from an acknowledge authority on the language--
particularly one who had earlier celebrated the revolutionary
fervor in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> that had led,
at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 18th century</TIMEX>, to forswearing...
supine parrotry.  How different from his declaration
at the outset of his career as a philologist: As
regards everything else, so as regards language, the
spirit of rigid conservatism operates as a principle of
unalloyed evil and mischief.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>'s disputatious style in his many contributions
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> led him into controversy, and the
memorial notices published after his death were often
circumspect.  In one, a life-long <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> declared:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> had all the aggressive confidence of modesty
adequately equipped, a judgment that conceals
criticism in praise.  Another opined that his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prose</ENAMEX> was apt to be difficult reading.  Had he combined
with his vast learning a light and playful style,
he would not more effectually have strewn the field
with the slain, but he would have made the process
as delightful as it was edifying.  As it is, his works are
a permanent resource against the ignoramus and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">charlatan</ENAMEX> who seek to make the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language
into their own likeness.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of American</ENAMEX>
Biography is rather more blunt: His style was
too subject to his own criticism to be natural; it was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">selfconscious</ENAMEX> and pedantic.

            Despite their often dry character, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>'s works
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bear</ENAMEX> re-reading, not least because of his refusal to
bewail the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the language: No unprejudiced
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, if he takes the trouble to observe and consider,
can <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soberly</ENAMEX> maintain, that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> is deteriorating.
Yet, above all, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> raised the standard of
discussion on the bulwarks of evidence, and, even
when he was captious or carping, he compelled respect.
Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Olmsted Williams</ENAMEX> often engaged
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall</ENAMEX> in the pages of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dial and of Modern Language</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Notes</ENAMEX>; these exchanges <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Williams</ENAMEX> published in
Some Questions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good English</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1897</TIMEX>), recognizing
that with such an adversary as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> it was difficult
to claim victory even when claiming the benefit
of the last word.  Of course <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> was often dismissed--by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigner</ENAMEX> unworthy to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English</ENAMEX> usage and by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> as an anglophile
and expatriate.  But the most serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> took him seriously, and, if he did not
make uninformed allegations about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> impossible,
he at least made them subject to the trial of
evidence from usage.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australia</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Environment: the First Fifty Years</ENAMEX>



            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australia</ENAMEX> has recently (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>) celebrated its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bicentenary</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian National Dictionary</ENAMEX>
was published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX> and, for the first
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, it has been possible to assemble and describe
the set of lexical innovations used in one particular
semantic field, that is, the words and meanings of
words that register perceptions and utilizations of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> environment.  I have tried to build my
argument not on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-interpretation of single,
apparently key words but on the evidence of the use
of those words within a set, within a context of
groupings of semantically related words that gain
weight and suggest directions of enquiry from their
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">mass.</ENAMEX>  But the problem of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-interpretation remains.

            This article is concerned with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> fifty years
of settlement, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1788-1838</TIMEX> and begins with the two
collocations Crown land and waste land , which
sometimes coalesce in the uniquely <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> waste
lands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crown</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crown</ENAMEX> land is used (as it has
been in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian English</ENAMEX>) of land that is either inalienable
or unalienated, of land that is either reserved
for the purposes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crown</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crown</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> or held in the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crown</ENAMEX>.  In the
former sense it gives way to government land or to
more specific terms for parcels of land like government
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, government <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX>, government garden,
government ground, government paddock, government
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reserve</ENAMEX> and government run ; in the latter it
comes increasingly to refer to land that is available
for grant, lease, or purchase, to distinguish land
which is variously described as unlocated, unoccupied
or (from slightly later, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1840s</TIMEX>) unsettled
from land which is located or settled.  Waste land is
used (as it had been in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX> and, later,
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Zealand English</ENAMEX>) to distinguish unused
land--uncultivated because unoccupied land--from
land under cultivation or in some way improved as
pasture.  It is thus synonymous with wild land (also
so used in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX>) or with the apparently
contradictory wild government ground described in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1849</TIMEX> as covered with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and grass never used
before, except for feeding blackfellows, kangaroos,
cattle, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>.  This description recognizes
that as yet unalienated land might have been
used as wild pasture, just as an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1867</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> of bureaucratese
can complain that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crown</ENAMEX> lands
are very frequently, in Government phrase, styled
the waste lands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crown</ENAMEX>... [though] they
cannot... with propriety be called waste lands, for
they are applied to the only purpose, speaking of
them in general, to which they can ever be applied--grazing.

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> arrival in these waste lands was described
in terms of settlement and location .  Both are
very much terms of occupation.  Settlement is used in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1788</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> as established or
founded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1792</TIMEX> of a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, or
place where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have settled or established
themselves.  The verb settle is used transitively of the
action of peopling a place, as in to settle a district,
intransitively of the action of settling oneself, as in
to settle in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>.  By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1803</TIMEX> the unoccupied
land is so designated and before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1820</TIMEX> the settled districts
or settled lands are so identified.  Settler , from
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1788</TIMEX>, was roughly synonymous with colonist: I say
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly</NUMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W.H. Breton</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1833</TIMEX>, distinguishes
between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> only and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX>
the whole of the free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>, though this
may be an academic distinction as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dunmore</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lang</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next year</TIMEX> remarks that spirit of irreconcilable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enmity</ENAMEX> to standing timber... almost uniformly
evinced by all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX>.  The
point is that, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX> , they had come to
occupy land and through occupation to utilize it.  Location
is more difficult, because its sense history in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX> is complex; but in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian</ENAMEX>
usage of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1788-1838</TIMEX> period it meant either an
allocation or grant of land or the act of establishing a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">settler</ENAMEX> in a place, in which case it was synonymous
with settlement, as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> will shortly be
thrown open to general location.  To locate meant, similarly,
to allocate (a parcel of land), to settle (oneself)
on a piece of land, or to select (a piece of land).
Located <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> was synonymous with settled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX>,
the limits of location (or boundaries or bounds)
the further extent of settlement, the boundary within
which land was surveyed and available for legal tenure,
the border , as it was also known.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> of
allocating land within the limits of location required
land <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land Board</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX>, land
fund, land orders, and led (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 1809</TIMEX>) to
land-jobbing and speculation by land-jobbers and
land-sharks.
            

            There was a continuing expansion into new
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">districts</ENAMEX>, new settlements as land was
taken up, opened up or, as the pace grew, thrown
open (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1830</TIMEX>).  Movement towards the interior was
movement up the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> (from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 1805</TIMEX>) or
into the back <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>; movement towards the settled
districts was movement down the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> or in: travelers
came in from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX> as they can now come in
to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, though out, except in collocations like
outdistrict, outfarm, outsettler, outsettlement, belongs
to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> period.  Squatter, not in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
and earliest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> sense of one who illegally
occupies land but in the main <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> sense of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> who has title to a tract of grazing land, is recorded
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1837</TIMEX> and is essentially a word of the
1840s; but in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> period both runs and stations
were being established for the grazing of sheep
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX>.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1804</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> so engaged, as distinct
from one who farmed <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX>--who engaged in
agricultural pursuits--was known as a grazier, and
from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1820s</NUMEX> such a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> occupied a property
(with the clear connotation of ownership).

            Words which through their coinage reflect the
utilization of the land give some measure of the environmental
impact --if I may use an anachronism.
A group of words reflects the immediate needs of an
isolated settlement seeking self-sufficiency: dairy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">station</ENAMEX>, farm, farming (restricted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX>-raising)
farm-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockholder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stock-keeper</ENAMEX>, stockman,
stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>, stock pen , and stock yard .  A group reflects
the use made of local resources.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> examples
are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mount Pitt bird</ENAMEX> and mutton <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>.  Of the first
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Gidley King</ENAMEX> wrote in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1794</TIMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Pit</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Birds</ENAMEX> are as Numerous as ever, Notwithstanding
upwards of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two Hundred thousand</NUMEX> have been killed
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Yearly</TIMEX>.  (The name is now obsolete and the bird
breeds only on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lord Howe Island</ENAMEX>.)  As to mutton
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bird</ENAMEX>, tastes vary: it may have required as W.H.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX> wrote in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1839</TIMEX> a desperate stomach to attack
such an oily mass, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Clarke</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1790</TIMEX> lovingly
packed a box for his beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Containing</ENAMEX>
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mount Pit Bird</ENAMEX>, A <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mutton Bird</ENAMEX>.  More
demonstrative are the uses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kangaroo</ENAMEX>, as evidenced
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kangaroo dog</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kangaroo flesh</ENAMEX>, kangaroo
hide, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kangaroo hunt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kangaroo leather</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kangaroo rug</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">kangaroo</ENAMEX> skin, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">kangaroo soup, kangaroo steak, kangaroo</ENAMEX>
steamer, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kangaroo stew</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kangaroo tail</ENAMEX>, kangaroo
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tail soup</ENAMEX> ; of bark, as in bark chopper, bark <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mill</ENAMEX>, bark
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stripper</ENAMEX>; of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cedar</ENAMEX>, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cedar brush</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cedar cutter</ENAMEX>,
cedar grounds, cedar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>.  But a much larger
grouping of coinages <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bears witnesses</ENAMEX> to the embryonic
pastoral industry: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> walk, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> hunting,
cattle run, cattle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>; stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>,
stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX>, stock horse, stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, stock
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hut</ENAMEX>, stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proprietor</ENAMEX>, stock property, stock run, stock
station; sheep <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, sheep downs, sheep establishment,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sheep hills</ENAMEX>, sheep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX>, sheep land, sheep
master, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep overseer</ENAMEX>, sheep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>, sheep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proprietor</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep watchman</ENAMEX>, sheep yard.
            

            The words listed so far are those of occupation
and use: what remains to identify in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early</TIMEX> period
is an indication of the perception of the landscape on
which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> were imposing themselves and
their industry.  From the start there was a tension
between resemblance and difference, between recollection
of the old world and recognition of the
new.  On the one hand there were names which
were qualified before being applied, like wild currant,
wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fig</ENAMEX>, wild geranium, wild indigo, wild parsnip,
wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">spinach</ENAMEX>, wild yam; or native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flax</ENAMEX>, nabox,
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native cherry</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native cranberry</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native flax</ENAMEX>, native
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native myrtle</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native parsley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> plum;
or names in which the qualifier is a color, as in blue
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gum</ENAMEX>, green wattle, white honeysuckle.  On the other
there were new names, borrowings from Aboriginal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">languages</ENAMEX>, like boobook, dingo, koala, kurrajong,
wallaby, wallaroo, waratah, and wombat, all from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dharuk</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> language); descriptive names
like blackbutt, bottlebrush, duckbill, flooded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gum</ENAMEX>,
and gumtree; or popular adoptions of scientific
names like banksia, callistemon, casuarina, boronia,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eucalyptus</ENAMEX>, and platypus.  In generic terms this is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manifested</ENAMEX> in the replacement of woods by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX>,
once the inadequacy of woods is recognized, and by
the redefinition of words like forest and plain.  The
important contrast is between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX> vegetation
in its natural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> covered in such vegetation,
and brush and scrub as subsets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX> on the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hand, and, on the other, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> that is naturally
open or that has been cleared, an activity which gave
the language to burn off as well as short-lived collocations
like clearing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gang</ENAMEX>, clearing lease, and clearing
party.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forest</ENAMEX> is redefined, as in an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1805</TIMEX> description
of forest land as such as abounds with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grass</ENAMEX>
and is the only Ground which is fit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Graze</ENAMEX>; according
to the local distinction, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Grass</ENAMEX> is the discriminating
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Character</ENAMEX> and not the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Trees</ENAMEX>, for by making
use of the Former, it is clearly understood as different
from a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Brush or Scrub</ENAMEX>. Plain is also redefined,
being applied to undulating as well as flat country
and admitting the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stands</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>.  The important feature is openness, as in collocations
like open forest, open forest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, and open
forest land.
            

            Availability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is obviously important: the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> (as in the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tank</ENAMEX>
Stream) is there from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1791</TIMEX>; lagoon used, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, of fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1797</TIMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pond</ENAMEX> as in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of ponds from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1799</TIMEX>; waterhole from
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1817</TIMEX>.  The value of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river frontage</ENAMEX> was recognized,
land distant from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> being known as back country.
In from the coast ranges of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX>, tiers as
they were known in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tasmania</ENAMEX> and later South <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>--in
both cases a specific use of a word meaning
line or series--supplied an impediment just as,
on a more local scale, flat implied a usable river
plain, gully or razorback an obstruction to land
use or to movement.  The hot wind that blew from
the interior, later to be named the sirocco, was
known with vivid simplicity as the hot wind.
            

            The point is that in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> fifty-year segment,
the lexical landscape is one of occupation and subsistence
rather than exploration: it is utilitarian rather
than interpretive.  It registers a process of improvement,
improve being an originally <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> usage,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1830s</TIMEX>, referring to the bringing
of land into agricultural or pastoral use, and including
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clearing</ENAMEX>, the provision of fences, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, etc.,
with the intention of increasing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">land</ENAMEX>'s productivity.
Despite that--or because of it--another Americanism
which came into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> use in the 1830s
was overstock.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> will have noticed that there has
been no reference to the indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>--
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Papuans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Blacks</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aborigines</ENAMEX>,
as they were variously named.  That is not because
their presence had made no impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, for
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than fifty</NUMEX> words were borrowed from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dharuk</ENAMEX>,
most of them in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early</TIMEX> period.  These did include
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gunyah</ENAMEX> and gibber-gunyah , which recognized that
they had places of habitation, also given the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
names of breakweathers, or breakwinds, or known as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">huts</ENAMEX>.  But the only words which imply some sort of
relationship, either of location or utilization, between
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aborigines</ENAMEX> and the land are hunting
ground (it being observed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1830</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natives</ENAMEX>
are as tenacious of their hunting grounds as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX>
are of their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX>), the verb to fire , used with reference
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> practice of setting fire to a
tract of vegetation either to trap <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> or to maintain
grassland, and run and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>.  Both of the last
were used in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1820s</TIMEX> of land recognized as being
occupied by an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, in contexts
that acknowledge the existence of tribal boundaries.
Run continued to be used in this sense (as late as
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1909</TIMEX>), but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> came increasingly to mean an establishment
rather than an area and, in this application,
to equate with mission <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> or a reserve set
aside by a government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> (later native reserve,
and later still <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aboriginal</ENAMEX> reserve ).

            Not all dictionaries enter the names of real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,
but many do.  Among English-language
monolingual dictionaries, the practice is widespread
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and reviving in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>.  A very recent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> origin, is the addition of
names to monolingual dictionaries of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as a
Second <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Language</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESL</ENAMEX>], such as the new encyclopedic
edition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford Advanced Learner</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>).

            Pronunciation dictionaries and bilingual dictionaries
typically enter names, too.  But the purpose of
such entries is linguistic rather than encyclopedic:
they are there to show how they are pronounced or
how their form differs in different languages:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cicero</ENAMEX>... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cicerón</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>... Queen of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scots</ENAMEX>,  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart María Estuardo</ENAMEX>.

--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins Spanish Dictionary</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>)

            

            Now and then, however, even bilingual dictionaries
enter names for their content rather than for
their form.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mondadori</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pocket Italian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English English</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX>) attempts to introduce
its Anglophone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to the glories of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> civilization
by entering the names of some of its avatars and
describing their achievements in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>:


Cimabue, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni</ENAMEX>, early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Florentine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1240</TIMEX>?-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1302</TIMEX>?).

Goldoni, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlo</ENAMEX>, the greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dramatist</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> of comedies (in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venetian</ENAMEX> dialect) (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1707-1793</TIMEX>).

Mondadori, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arnoldo</ENAMEX>, leading <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> publisher
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1889-</TIMEX> ).

            

            This last array prompts the question: how are names
chosen for inclusion?

            Other items ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">cat, the</ENAMEX>, kick the bucket ) are sometimes
selected from a corpus of language in use.
Items that appear frequently in sources of different
types are included; items less frequent or more restricted
in their distribution are kept out.  Not all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionaries</ENAMEX> use such objective evidence.  Many--
perhaps most--still rely on the subjective judgment
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lexicographers</ENAMEX> who compile them, aided often
by a judicious perusal of what other dictionaries
include.  Where names are concerned, I know of
no dictionary in any language whose selection was
made from a corpus: all rely on the assessment of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lexicographers</ENAMEX>.

            Which names are deemed worthy of inclusion?
Let me examine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> dictionaries with names in
them: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>) [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W9</TIMEX>] <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College</ENAMEX>

for good measure, an ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nouveau Petit</ENAMEX> Larousse
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Illustré</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PL</ENAMEX> ].  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>;
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>; the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.  All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> enter
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cicero/Cicéron</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cimabue, Goldoni</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mary/Marie</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Queen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scots</ENAMEX>) , but not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mondadori</ENAMEX> .
For a finer-grained investigation my starting-point
will be the surname <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX>, where I find the following
names:

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12                                         4                 3                    7                   7                   1</NUMEX>

            

            Startlingly, of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robinsons</ENAMEX> no single one is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enshrined</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> dictionaries!  Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> are

seen from the table above, only W9 has, and only
CED3 approaches, parity between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> and
non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> Robinsons.

            So to check these dictionaries for national bias, I
looked at a few minimal pairs: pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who
seemed to play similar roles on their respective sides
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>: suffragettes, birth-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX>, popular
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> of self-reliance, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX>:

            It is pretty clear that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CED3</ENAMEX> takes more
account of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> names than do the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
dictionaries of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> ones.  This is hardly surprising,
as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> do a better job with
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX> generally than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> dictionaries
do with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British English</ENAMEX>.

            But encyclopedic dictionaries (though not, perhaps,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESL</ENAMEX> ones) are supposed to include important
names from all over the world.  So to examine cultural
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> in a wider sense, I checked the surname
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lambert</ENAMEX>, happily borne by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anglophones</ENAMEX> as well as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Francophones</ENAMEX>.  Here is what I found:

            If the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dictionary</ENAMEX> was weak on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robinsons</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> are at least as
weak on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamberts</ENAMEX>.  The pedagogical pretensions of
encyclopedic dictionaries must be taken with a grain
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>, though their skewing may be a fair reflection
of the limited knowledge that speech communities
have of the worthies of whom other speech communities
boast.  And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">German Lambert</ENAMEX>, though unworthy
of a biographical entry of his own in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
Anglophone dictionaries, is remembered nevertheless
in their etymologies of the scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lambert</ENAMEX>, that bears his name.

            Having somehow selected the names to be included,
lexicographers must set about explaining
them.  But how?  The mere indication of the dates
and places of birth and death will usually suffice to
identify the bearer of a name uniquely; if one goes
further, where does one stop?  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictionaries</ENAMEX> seem to
divide into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> camps.  Some say the minimum, limiting
themselves typically to birth and death dates,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nationality</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation</ENAMEX> or status [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W9</TIMEX> ].  Others
attempt more, need more space, and run risks.  Two
examples will show the problems:

            What was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Britten</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation</ENAMEX> or status?  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Composer</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English or British</ENAMEX>?  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornwallis</ENAMEX> is unequivocally
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> to everyone but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.)
And which of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britten</ENAMEX>'s many works deserve mention--besides
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Grimes</ENAMEX> ?  I suspect that what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Britten</ENAMEX>
is known for most of all is A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Young Person</ENAMEX>'s
Guide to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orchestra</ENAMEX>; but perhaps music for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
does not count for much in dictionaries for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grown-ups</ENAMEX>.

            With ordinary words and phrases in dictionaries,
the criteria for including them and the criteria
for explaining them are independent in principle.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Cat</ENAMEX> gets in because of the frequency and range of its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">occurrences</ENAMEX> (determined objectively or subjectively).
What the dictionary says about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> has then
to be decided.

            With names in dictionaries, the criteria for inclusion
and the criteria for explanation are inextricably
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interdependent</ENAMEX>.  Britten, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cornwallis</ENAMEX>, and all the
rest get in not because of their abundant presence in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">texts</ENAMEX>, but because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lexicographers</ENAMEX> feel that the bearers
of these names are important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX>.  And the explanations
the lexicographers proceed to provide for
the names are explicit attempts to justify their inclusion.
What is thus characteristic of such encyclopedic
entries is true of all the entries in encyclopedias.
In other words, an encyclopedia is an enormous exercise
in self-justification.
         
         
            Verbal <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Aggression in The Wizard of Oz</ENAMEX>



            Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North Americans</ENAMEX> and many others worldwide
have watched the movie classic The
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wizard of Oz</ENAMEX> many times, either as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> or later
with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.  Yet few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> are aware of
the considerable amount of negative language in
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s movie.  There are some ninety occurrences
of name-calling, insults, taunts, threats, self-deprecation,
harsh commands, scolding, sarcastic
remarks, and other verbal aggression in that film.
Unless one's ears are tuned to listen for verbal aggression,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> simply does not notice most negative
language.  This holds true for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Wizard of Oz</ENAMEX> , too;
certainly most of it has escaped the attention of most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, even though they might have watched the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> television showing for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>[<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yman</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Baum</ENAMEX>'s book, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Wonderful</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wizard of Oz</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX>), is quite different from the film
version, not only in content but also in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX>.
For the book's text, I consulted <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Wizard of Oz</ENAMEX> ,
edited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Hearn</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>); for the movie, The
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wizard of Oz: The Screenplay</ENAMEX> , edited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noel Langley</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florence Ryerson</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edgar Allan Woolf</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>).

            Most of the aggression and verbal abuse appear
only in the movie but not in the book.  Among the
book's few maledicta --mild and colorless ones at
that--are: You are nothing but a big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coward</ENAMEX>! (Dorothey
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lion</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>), This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lion</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coward</ENAMEX> .  (Scarecrow
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Queen of the Field Mice</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>), You are a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wicked creature</ENAMEX>! (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wicked Witch</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83</NUMEX>), You are a humbug! (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Scarecrow to the Wizard</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX>), and I think you are a very bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>! (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy</ENAMEX> to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wizard</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>).  The movie, with its alliterative
abuse, name-calling, taunts, shouting and yelling,
threats, scolding, and nasty sarcasm is much livelier
and much scarier for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> than the book.  To be
sure, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s standards, the film's most often used
epithet, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fool</ENAMEX> is quite harmless; but such timeless
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pearls</ENAMEX> as You clinking, clanking, clattering collection
of caliginous junk! are as effective and amusing today
as they were fifty <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>.

            Actually, much of the verbal nastiness in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">film</ENAMEX> is not expressed by nasty terms but by the tone
of voice, facial expressions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> language, and
other paralingual means.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wicked Witch</ENAMEX>, especially,
uses terms of endearment ( my little pretty, my
fine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX> ) when addressing others; but her
menacing face and gestures, her vicious sarcasm, her
screaming laughter, and her saccharine voice while
uttering those polite-sounding addresses and scary
death-threats are much more effective and nasty
than simple name-calling would be.

            Space limitations preclude more than a sampling
of the citations.  The following are arranged
chronologically:

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>! (The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Witch</ENAMEX> to herself and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winged Chimpanzee</ENAMEX>, seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy</ENAMEX> in the
crystal ball waking up in the poppy field, after
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glinda</ENAMEX> let it snow.)

Who rang that bell?  Can't you read? (The irate
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Emerald City</ENAMEX> doorman--referring to the sign
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BELL OUT OF ORDER</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLEASE KNOCK</ENAMEX>--fiercely

Jiminy Crickets! (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy</ENAMEX> responding to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wizard</ENAMEX>'s booming <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Silence</ENAMEX>! She utters a euphemism
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus Christ</ENAMEX>!)

You dare to come to me for a heart--do you?
You clinking, clanking, clattering collection of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caliginous</ENAMEX> junk! (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The angry Wizard yelling at</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tin Man</ENAMEX>, who wanted a heart.)

And you, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scarecrow</ENAMEX>, have the effrontery to ask
for a brain?  You billowing bale of bovine fodder
! (The irate <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wizard yelling at the Scarecrow</ENAMEX>,
who wanted a brain.)

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silence</ENAMEX>, whippersnapper! (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Wizard angrily</ENAMEX>
responding to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy</ENAMEX>.)

Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
(The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Witch</ENAMEX> savagely to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko</ENAMEX>, referring to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toto</ENAMEX>
in the basket, after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy</ENAMEX> refused to give her
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ruby slippers</ENAMEX>.)

Fool that I am! I should have remembered! (The
Witch self-deprecatingly, after she touched the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ruby</ENAMEX> slippers and burned herself.)

Catch him, you fool! (The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Witch</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko</ENAMEX>, after
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toto</ENAMEX> escaped from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Witch</ENAMEX>'s basket.)

Drat you and your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>! (The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Witch cursing Dorothy</ENAMEX>
after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toto</ENAMEX> got away.  She uses a euphemism

I'll tear' em apart! (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lion</ENAMEX> to the Scarecrow

to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Winkies</ENAMEX> who are marching on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Witch</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>.)

Seize them! Stop them, you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fools</ENAMEX>! (The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Witch</ENAMEX>
shrieking at her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guards</ENAMEX> after the Scarecrow
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tin Man</ENAMEX> dropped a huge chandelier on
many of them, and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> are running away.)

Well, the last to go will see the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> go before
her... and her mangy little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>, too!

You cursed brat! Look what you've done! (The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Witch</ENAMEX> shouting at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy</ENAMEX>, who has just
thrown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> on the burning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scarecrow</ENAMEX> and accidentally
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">splashed the Witch</ENAMEX>, who is now
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">melting</ENAMEX> and dying.)

Do you presume to criticize the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Great Oz</ENAMEX>?  You
ungrateful <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX>! (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Wizard angrily to</ENAMEX>
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>, after they returned to him with the

promise, if he were indeed really great and
powerful.)

You humbug! (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scarecrow</ENAMEX> indignantly to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wizard</ENAMEX> after they discovered that he was just a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> behind a curtain.)

Yes, yes, yes, exactly so.  I'm a humbug. (The
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Wizard</ENAMEX> self-deprecatingly to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, admitting
his fraud.)

Oh, you're a very bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>! (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy</ENAMEX> scolding
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wizard</ENAMEX>, after he admitted he was a fraud.)

Oh, no, my dear.  I'm a very good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>--I'm just
a very bad <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wizard</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Self</ENAMEX>-deprecatory admission

            Mottoes from Zetland



            Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shetland</ENAMEX> was officially known as
Zetland, a name more suggestive of its fascinating
and ancient history.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Viking</ENAMEX> invasion of
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> gave a strong practical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> to the earlier existing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Celtic</ENAMEX> culture, and
many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norse</ENAMEX> words remain in the dialect.  These give
an arresting piquancy to the many proverbs still surviving
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shetland</ENAMEX>.

            Most of these are crisp and pithy in the extreme,
with an admirable precision of thought.  A native
caution is typical of many, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Better da</ENAMEX> ill kent
[known] as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da</ENAMEX> guid untried , which roughly parallels
the old saying Better the devil you know... but
expressed rather more forcefully.

            
               Dere few rodds at doesna hae a mirae at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">da end o</TIMEX>
him sums up the realism (even cynicism) of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shetlander</ENAMEX> and more wariness still in Never hüve oot
[throw out] dirty water till da clean be in! Amusingly
this represents a caution against burning one's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> unless one is sure of a safe <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exit</ENAMEX>.

            Exasperation with the young is a topic in many
of these proverbs.  The sore feelings of a harassed
parent bringing up mischievous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> might be
soothed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shetland motto Mony</ENAMEX> a pellit [troublesome]
foal haes made a good <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Dere</ENAMEX> broken
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pots</ENAMEX> in aa lands , as a reminder that the problem
is universal.

            Yet overindulgence of the young was firmly
checked by the reminder that It's late time to sift
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da</ENAMEX> sids [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chaff</ENAMEX>] is ida <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> ,' meaning discipline
is only effective when started at an early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Love</ENAMEX>, courtship, and marriage, as might be expected,
called forth more gems of wisdom.  Too sudden
and ardent a romance was typically greeted by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> shaking among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elders</ENAMEX> who had seen it all
before.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cald</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da</ENAMEX> kale at cøls ida plate, an cald is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da</ENAMEX>
love at starts ower haet <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold</ENAMEX> is the kale that cools on
the plate and cold is the love that starts over hot.

            Spinsters were consoled by the proverb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lang</ENAMEX> lowse daa ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teddered</ENAMEX> , and a grieving jilted girl
was advised by the motto, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better</ENAMEX> ee hert braks dan aa
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da</ENAMEX> wirld winders , warning her not to show her feelings
too strongly.

            More cheerful was the proverb A bonny <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX> is
shŭn <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">buskit</ENAMEX> [well dressed]; but the wedding of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
very unattractive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> was rather unkindly
summed up as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hairy butter</ENAMEX> is good enyoch for siddy
[coarse] <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>!
            

            Such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native shrewdness</ENAMEX> means excellent judgment
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> and more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Shetland proverbs</ENAMEX> echo
this.  The hypocrite was neatly described as Hit's ill
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da</ENAMEX> kettle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crook tae</ENAMEX> ca <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da</ENAMEX> kettle black , while ` Caff
[<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chaff</ENAMEX>] aye flees heicher [flies higher] dan guid
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coarn</ENAMEX> summed up a false <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who deserts one in trouble.
trouble.

            True comradeship, however, is not forgotten.  A
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend ida wye</ENAMEX> is better dan <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a penny</NUMEX> ida pocket , but
neighbor problems call forth, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yer</ENAMEX> can win by aa yer
kin, bit by yer neebir ye canna win .  As for the damage
caused by gossip,  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ill</ENAMEX> news is lack a fitless heddercowe ,
a witty warning that tittle tattle can travel
like a rootless clump of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heather</ENAMEX>!

            The sheer toil experienced by most Shetlanders
is another source of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proverbs</ENAMEX>: Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s back is
shapit for his ain burden ; and A moothful is as guid as
a belly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fu</ENAMEX> firmly reminds of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of real want.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grit</ENAMEX> is advised rather than brooding in hard
times.  Glowerin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ida lum</ENAMEX> [by the chimney] never
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">filled da</ENAMEX> pot .  As for time of plenty coming rapidly
after scarcity, watch out for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> want is nae maet
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hainin</ENAMEX> .

            Sadly the special motto of the crofter-fisherman
concerns the hardship caused by lack of funds for
investment.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Da</ENAMEX> riven [torn] sleeve hauds de haund
back .  Naturally, the lack of ready funds holds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>
back from vital purchase of an improved farm implement
or even a fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX>.

            Many of these ancient proverbs would provide
excellent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</TIMEX>'s resolutions, but perhaps the
best of them advises us to live <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> at a time
without so much worrying: It's a guid day at pitts aff
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da</ENAMEX> nicht! It will be interesting to see if any new
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proverbs</ENAMEX> will be invented in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shetland</ENAMEX> concerning
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Sea</ENAMEX> oil and the welcome novelty of its young
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> now able to make a living at home.  A new
awareness of rich history and tradition of belonging
to The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Rock</ENAMEX> plus caution concerning
any threat to the native environment now provide
much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> for thought and material for pungent new
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Shetland proverbs</ENAMEX>.
         
         
            Front Back-axle



            Playing the dying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> in an otherwise
forgettable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX> movie, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Gere</ENAMEX> was
short of both breath and temper.

            Must you record my every word? he gasped
when he spotted a courtier making notes.

            It's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">for the Book of Samuel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX>.

            Even without the dubious contributions of Cecil
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B.De Mille</ENAMEX> or, in this case, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Beresford</ENAMEX>, there
are enough ludicrous misconceptions about the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>
in circulation.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of them, based on vague
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">memories</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Elizabethan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> of the Authorized
Version (albeit much of its language was borrowed
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyndale</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> translation), is
that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Classical Hebrew</ENAMEX> tends to be long-winded and
is overloaded with the equivalents of peradventure,
verily, and Does it find favor in my Lord's
sight?

            The considerable number of italicized words
sprinkled throughout every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">page</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> provides
a clue, usually overlooked, that the original is
not to blame.  <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Classical Hebrew</ENAMEX> dispenses with some
parts of speech that are necessary in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, so, in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>'s learned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to the
number of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> and fifty simply added those that
were required to make sense of the translation,
printing them in italics.

            Unfortunately, typographical convention employs
italics for emphasis.  I recall my old headmaster
was -ing and is -ing at the top of his lungs as he
read the Lesson every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,200</NUMEX> uncomprehending
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manchester</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolboys</ENAMEX>.  Behold his
bedstead was a bedstead of iron, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX>
would thunder,  Is it not in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rabbath</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ammon</ENAMEX>.  He would then add insult to injury by
frequently reminding us that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> is the language
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>.  I had
had enough of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> literally knocked
into me by a rebbe , an old-fashioned <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hebrew</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>,
to know that the voice that breath'd over
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eden</ENAMEX> was not the one that read the news on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX>.

            The Word according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> was as eccentric
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Laughton</ENAMEX>'s version of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lear</ENAMEX> .  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX>
believed that a capital letter in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Folio</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quarto</ENAMEX> texts indicates emphasis, Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Hall</ENAMEX>
wrote.  No amount of pointing out the vagaries of
Elizabethan typesetting could shift his conviction.
So as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lear</ENAMEX> he was left accenting in all the
wrong places and fighting for breath.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>, I am happy to report, has always
tended to an admirable brevity.  By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1708</TIMEX>, Iohann
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buxtors</ENAMEX> had already published his Abbreviaturis
Hebraicis , and the colloquial <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> of the sabra ,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX>, carries on the grand tradition.
The result is that everyday speech now resembles
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ira Gershwin</ENAMEX>'s witty lyrics for 'S 'Wonderful:

               
Don't mind telling you,
In my humble fash,
That you thrill me through
With a tender pash.

            

            This is just the opposite of the current trend in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX>, to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paraphrase Gavin Ewart</ENAMEX>, inflate the language in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> they shouldn't oughtn't just to make their pronouncements
sound more important.  Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX>
no longer employs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words to describe an institution
founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1785</TIMEX> but now describes The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>
as  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Times</ENAMEX> newspaper, as if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX> might otherwise
believe that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times Furnishing Company</ENAMEX>
has taken to analyzing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Major</ENAMEX>'s foreign policy.
An old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine who worked on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian</ENAMEX>
maintains that we ought to be thankful that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthur</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mee's Children's Newspaper</ENAMEX> is no longer with us.
Otherwise the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> would undoubtedly refer to it as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children's</ENAMEX> Newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Colloquial Hebrew</ENAMEX> is excessively economical,
and its shortcuts have been further abbreviated by
the numerous acronyms used throughout the armed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>.  If it were not for the fact that military service
is compulsory and most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, at least, do reserve
duty until late middle age, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> would be quite unable to understand each
other.  I once pointed this out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerusalem Post</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s English-language <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>.  To
reflect <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> life more accurately, I suggested, they
would have to print the news in the same sort of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX> favored by real-estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>:


The Is'l <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">govt</ENAMEX>'s refusl <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> agree <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLO</ENAMEX> attndce

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stading</ENAMEX> in te way of a jst & lsting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.E.</ENAMEX> peace.

            

            Compressed speech is the norm, particularly among sabras.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dash</ENAMEX>, they cry, telescoping ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drishat</ENAMEX> ) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sh</ENAMEX>(alom) ,
when they wish you to give someone their regards, followed
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehit</ENAMEX>(raot) ' literally <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">au revoir</ENAMEX>, as they bid
you farewell.  To be fair, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lehit</ENAMEX> is gradually being
pushed out by a foreign importation, 'Bye .

            Even the notorious sabra impudence is frequently
expressed in a truncated form.  Zabash, they
say as they dismiss a subject, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX>( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> ) ba (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">'aya</NUMEX>) sh(elekha),
That's your problem.  Little wonder that foreign-born
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX>, especially those who were taught old-world
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">manners</ENAMEX>, soon learn to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parrot</ENAMEX> another abbreviated
sabra expression: they describe the offender
as having a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Padas Pa</ENAMEX>(rtsuf) d(oresh) s(tira) a face
that invites a slap.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rehov Dizengoff</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel Aviv</ENAMEX>'s main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>,
is usually shortened to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dizengoff</ENAMEX> or even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dizi</ENAMEX> , which
might mislead a tourist into believing it was named
after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benjamin Disraeli</ENAMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meir Dizengoff</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX>.  This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">thrift</ENAMEX> of tongues sometimes
gets sabras into trouble when they venture
abroad.  They confuse their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, for example,
by asking how to get to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> when they
mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford Street</ENAMEX> and not the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of dreaming
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spires</ENAMEX>.  The shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marks</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spencer's</ENAMEX>, is more of a magnet for visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX>
than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buckingham Palace</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madame Tussaud</ENAMEX>'s combined.

            This sort of mishap is only one of the problems
they encounter.  Other misunderstandings frequently
occur because of an inability to distinguish between
the vowels of bit and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beet</ENAMEX>.  An <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> who found
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">lodgings in Weech Road, Hampstead</ENAMEX>, found herself
involved in an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbott</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costello</ENAMEX> routine every
time she went to register as an alien at the local police
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">station</ENAMEX>.  When she was asked for her address, she
would answer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wich Road</ENAMEX>.

            Yes, which <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>? the desk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sergeant</ENAMEX> would repeat
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">patiently</ENAMEX>.

            I can't imagine what the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> would
have had to say if <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hebrew</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pronouns</ENAMEX> had cropped up
in this comedy routine.  The possibilities are endless
for who means he while, contrariwise, he means
she, and me signifies who.

            Borrowings from other languages frequently undergo
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sea</ENAMEX> changes, but when they are complicated by
the tendency of colloquial <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> to abbreviate, the
results are frequently weird and wonderful.  Sealed-beam
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">headlights</ENAMEX> , for example, were corrupted into
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silbim</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>; but - im is the masculine plural suffix
for nouns-- kibbutz, kibbutzim, for example.  The
result, not entirely unexpectedly, is that a single
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">headlight</ENAMEX> is now referred to as a silb.  Some borrowings
completely mystify the non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hebrew</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>.  It
does not take much ingenuity to translate ambrex as
handbrakes, but the real difficulty arises when a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-part noun is abbreviated and the wrong <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>, so
to speak, is discarded.  Kvacker, for example, referring
to any kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porridge</ENAMEX>, is a truncated form of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quaker Oats</ENAMEX>, while kottej is cottage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> and not a
quaint little thatched <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwelling</ENAMEX> with roses entwined
round the door.  The same anarchy reigns in electronics,
where tep means tape-recorder and not the tape
itself.  The leisure industry is similarly afflicted: a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kountri</ENAMEX> is not a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">territory</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> but a country
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">club</ENAMEX>.

            There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> things according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Book of</ENAMEX>
Proverbs that are beyond understanding: the way
of an eagle in the air; the way of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">serpent</ENAMEX> upon a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">rock</ENAMEX>; the way of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> in the sea; and the way of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maid</ENAMEX>.  A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> that defies comprehension
is now the herbrew pony, borrowed from ponytail
migrated from the back of the head to the forehead
and came to mean bangs or fringe.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> who have got this far, may be able to
tackle another development without the aid of a diagram:
bekex, a simple corruption of back-axle, has
been in common usage since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
mandate, for the mechanical expertise of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish Brigade</ENAMEX>, manhandling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> cwt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> over
frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> mountain passes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter of 1944</TIMEX>,
soon outstripped their grasp of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  Bekex, as far
as they were concerned, meant any azle.  As a result,
it is now necessary to qualify the noun in order
to specify which axle is being referred to, so that
bekex kidmi means, tout <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, front back-axle.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tide</ENAMEX>-end <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, which is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddington</ENAMEX> (or is it?)



            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leslie Dunkling</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>] has his reservations
(unfairly, it seems to me) about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.D. Mills</ENAMEX>, A
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of English Place-Names</ENAMEX>. But he could
have mentioned a most important function that the
book fulfills: that of setting straight the many misapprehensions
regarding the origins of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> place-names.
It is not just that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like a colorful or
romantic origin for a name and one that they can
readily understand, but that folk etymologies themselves
are perpetuated by reference works and
guide books normally well regarded for their trustworthiness
and authority.

            It is they, therefore, as much as anybody, who
are to blame for the continuing fiction that Abingdon
means <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of the abbey, that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> is named for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Botolph</ENAMEX>, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coventry</ENAMEX> means place of the abbey,
that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> word of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leighton Buzzard</ENAMEX> represents
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beau désert</ENAMEX>, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lichfield</ENAMEX> means
field of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpses</ENAMEX>, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maidstone</ENAMEX> means Medway
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX>, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morpeth</ENAMEX> means moor path, that Redruth
means <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Druids</ENAMEX>, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southend</ENAMEX> is so
called because it is at the southern end of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Essex</ENAMEX>, that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westminster</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a minster</NUMEX> west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Paul's Cathedral</ENAMEX>,
and so on.  At least Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX> lays all these revenants
to rest.

            Take <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Coventry</ENAMEX>, for example, and turn to the general
reference books and guides. Coventre, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Couentrev of Domesday Book</ENAMEX>, may derive from a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">convent</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saxon</ENAMEX> period [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Guide</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>]; It probably owes its origin to the erection
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 7th</TIMEX> c of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sexon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> [ The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Shell Guide</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>]; Established under
the protection of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saxon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 7th century</TIMEX>
[ The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Shell Guide</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>].  Yes,
they are cautious, and do not explicity derive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coventry</ENAMEX>
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX>, but they do imply that the word
is the source of the name.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston</ENAMEX> has long had its name linked with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Botolph</ENAMEX> and is explicitly interpreted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue</ENAMEX>
Guide as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Botolph</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town</ENAMEX>.  The connection is
also mentioned in other works, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Everyman</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Encyclopaedia</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>): Its name is said to be detived
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Botolph</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Botolph</ENAMEX> having
founded a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> here in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">654</NUMEX>.

            But all these origins are either just plain wrong
or at any rate highly suspect.

            So what do the names mean?  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abingdon</ENAMEX> means
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Æbba</ENAMEX>'s hill; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> means <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bōtwulf</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>; Conventry
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">means Cofa</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leighton Buzzard</ENAMEX> is named
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Busard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, who owned land here in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th century</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lichfield</ENAMEX> means open <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">land</ENAMEX> near
Letocetum, the latter name itself meaning gray
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wood; Maidstone</ENAMEX> probably means stone of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maidens</ENAMEX> (i.e., where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> gathered); <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morpeth</ENAMEX>,
like it or not, means murder path; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redruth</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornish</ENAMEX>
name, means red <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ford; Southend</ENAMEX> arose at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southern</ENAMEX> end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prittlewell</ENAMEX> parish; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westminster</ENAMEX> is
west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">City of London</ENAMEX>.

            How can one be so sure?  Because the forms of
the names, as they are recorded over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>, tell
use so.  To put it broadly, we must be guided by language
as well as by history or geography.  Historic
events and geographical attributes themselves frequently
serve to promote many of these false etymologies.
It cannot be denied that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Abingdon</ENAMEX> arose
by an abbey, for example, or that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maidstone</ENAMEX> is on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medway</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Botolph</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, is moreover
a noted landmark (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Stump</ENAMEX>) is more-can
also readily envisage the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bedfordshire</ENAMEX> countryside
around <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leighton Buzzard</ENAMEX> as at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time being a
beautiful wild place.  (The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of Beaudesert
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley</ENAMEX>-in-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warwickshire</ENAMEX>, has a name that
really does mean this.)

            Of course, one cannot be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred</NUMEX> per cent
certain about the exact meaning of every name.
That is way it is necessary to say probably about
the meaning of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maidston</ENAMEX>.  But this origin is much
more likely than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> quoted.

            Maybe this is the place to shatter a few more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">illusions</ENAMEX>, not restricting the names to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX> does, but extending them to include other
well-known places in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>.  The pseudo-origins
have all been recorded in print, even though some
derive from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gazetteers</ENAMEX>.

            
               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arundel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Sussex</ENAMEX>) does not mean swallow,
from Old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, but is Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> meaning
hoarhound valley, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> of the nettle
family.

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Co. Cork</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX>) does not mean
Great <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baal</ENAMEX> but townland of the big
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">house.</ENAMEX>

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bideford</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Devon</ENAMEX>) does not mean by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ford</ENAMEX> but
probably ford at the stream called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Byd</ENAMEX>.
               

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Birmingham</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Midlands</ENAMEX>), despite the proximity
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castle Bromwich</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">West Bromwich</ENAMEX>, and
the colloquial form of its name as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brummagem</ENAMEX>, is
not related to those places (meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> where
broom grows) but means village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beorma</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> (i.e., his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX>).

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cambridgeshire</ENAMEX>) is not named for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cam</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river</ENAMEX> is named for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX>'s original name (in modern terms) was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grantabridge</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granta</ENAMEX> is still an alternative name
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cam</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, especially in academic circles,
e.g., for the title for the literary magazine
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granta</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> is named in some Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grantcheste</ENAMEX>, `<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> camp on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granta</ENAMEX>.

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chelmsford</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Essex</ENAMEX>), although on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chelmer</ENAMEX>,
does not take its name from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River</ENAMEX> but the
other way around.  Its name means <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cēolmæbreve;r</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ford</ENAMEX>, from a personal name.

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daventry</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northamptonshire</ENAMEX>) does not mean
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rivers or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Danes</ENAMEX> but
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dafa</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.  It is thus a name along the lines of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coventry</ENAMEX>.
               

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edinburgh</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>, is not so named
because it was founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North</ENAMEX>-umberland
(reigned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">617-33</NUMEX>).  The name is found
before his reign and perhaps means fort on a
slope.

               
                  Flamborough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humberside</ENAMEX>) is not so named
from the flames of a beacon here.  Its name
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">means Fleinn's</ENAMEX> stronghold, from a personal
name.

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gosport</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hampshire</ENAMEX>) does not have a name meaning
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">God</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, referring to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX> who took refuge from a storm
here.  Its name means <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">market town</ENAMEX> where geese
are sold.

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guildford</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Surrey</ENAMEX>) does not mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ford</ENAMEX> where
golden <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> grow, and still less ford of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guild</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ford</ENAMEX> by the hill with golden <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sands</ENAMEX>.

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Halifax</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Yorkshire</ENAMEX>) does not mean holy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX>,
traditionally referring to some martyred maiden,
but probably nook of land with coarse <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX>,
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part of the name representing Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">halh</ENAMEX> (related to modern hole and hollow ),
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> in this case being long, straggly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX>.

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hythe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kent</ENAMEX>) does not have a name related to haven
but derives from Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> hyth landing
place.  This despite the similarity of meaning.

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lewes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Sussex</ENAMEX>), on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ouse</ENAMEX>, does not derive
from this river, as if <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L'Ouse</ENAMEX>.  It may
not even represent the plural of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">hlyw</ENAMEX> burial mound as usually explained.  Current
thinking is that the name is related to Welsh
llechwedd slope, hillside.

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liverpool</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merseyside</ENAMEX>) is not named for its fabled
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">liver bird</ENAMEX>, despite the latter's representation in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s coat of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>.  Its name means what it
says, livered pool, i.e., one with muddy or
weedy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.  (The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Red Sea</ENAMEX> had the former literary
name of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Livered Sea</ENAMEX> similarly.)

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oakham</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leicestershire</ENAMEX>) is not named for its oaks
but means <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occa</ENAMEX>'s homestead or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occa's</ENAMEX> riverside
land, depending whether the second half of
the name represents Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> hām or hamm .

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> does not derive its name from nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osney</ENAMEX>
despite ecclesiastical links with this place.  It
means what it says: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ford</ENAMEX> where oxen cross.
(The alternative origin here was doubtless proposed
from the outrageous idea that a venerable
university <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> should have such a rustic name.)

               
                  Rutland, the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> (of which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oakham</ENAMEX>,
above, was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county town</ENAMEX>), does not mean
root land or red land or even rutted land but
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rōta</ENAMEX>'s land, from a personal name.

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallingford</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oxfordshire</ENAMEX>) does not refer to a ford
by an old fortification (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> vallum ) but means
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ford</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wealth</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, again from a personal
name.

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wellington</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shropshire</ENAMEX>) is not so called from its
location on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Watling Street</ENAMEX>.  Its name probably
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">means Wēala</ENAMEX>'s farm (i.e., one associated with
him in some way).

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westmoreland</ENAMEX>, the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> now subsumed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">into Cumbria</ENAMEX>, does not have a name meaning
west mere land, despite its proximity to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake District</ENAMEX>, but west moor land, i.e., land
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living to the west of the moors.
            

            And while we are about it, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> remains an
obscure name, despite attempts to interpret it as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Londinos</ENAMEX>' place, from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celtic</ENAMEX> personal name said
to mean wild <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.  The - don is almost certainly not
Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> denu valley (as it is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Croydon</ENAMEX> , wild
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saffron valley</ENAMEX>) or dūn hill (as it is in Huntingdon
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">huntsman</ENAMEX>'s hill), but probably represents an integral
part of some pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celtic</ENAMEX> name.  This means that
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part of the name does not mean, as has been
variously proposed, from a plethora of languages,
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">lake</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>, populous, plain, ship, moon,
among others.

            It was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudyard Kipling</ENAMEX>, incidentally, who in his
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">poem The River's Tale</ENAMEX>, promulgated the origin of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teddington</ENAMEX> in the quotation in the title of this article.
True, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teddington</ENAMEX> is on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thames</ENAMEX>, and moreover
it is at the upper tidal limit of the river.  But the
name actually means <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuda</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX>, from a personal
name.  Sorry, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>, but there it is.
         
         
            In the Name of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revolution</ENAMEX>



            Revolution does not invariably or even usually
have much effect on language.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puritan Revolution</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Civil War</ENAMEX>, in some ways culturally
the most radical of social upheavals, so annihilated
religious artifacts created in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> before
it that they are preciously rare <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>; yet it affected
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language hardly at all, even temporarily.
The survival after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Revolution</ENAMEX> of such
names in the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British colonies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>
as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgetown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX> evidence
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionary spirit</ENAMEX> in the future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
had little effect on nomenclature.  The same can be
said of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, where a few words like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reforma</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ejido</ENAMEX> took on new meanings during and after the
Revolution but where, with the exception of some
street names, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toponyms</ENAMEX> remained largely unaffected:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalupe</ENAMEX> remained <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guadalupe</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monterrey</ENAMEX>
remained <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monterrey</ENAMEX> .

            With the possible exception of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, who
tried changing even the names of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> to memorialize
their revolution, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> make more
of their language than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> about whose
language I know anything.  But whereas the changes
wrought in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">French Revolution</ENAMEX> were
canceled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Thermidorean</ENAMEX> reaction, in the
newly formed and freshly named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union of Soviet Socialist</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Republics</ENAMEX> (more commonly called the USSR
or, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cyrillic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCCP</ENAMEX> ) wholesale changes of toponyms,
following changes of personal names, did not
really set in till the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermidor</ENAMEX> brought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX>
to dictatorial power.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> it was not names alone that were
changed in the language of the revolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
The alphabet was trimmed of a letter that had
become phonetically superfluous, as c has become in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, and the orthography was simplified by the
omission of the hard sign after final hard consonants.
More subtle effects were introduced through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diction</ENAMEX>.  For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenin</ENAMEX>'s famous definition
of Communism, Communism--that is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soviet</ENAMEX>
rule plus the electrification of the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>,
with its <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">est</TIMEX>' and plyus strikes me as rather un-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>,
as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> jargon.  And the profusion of
acronyms that inundated the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> language owed
much to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionary brusqueness</ENAMEX>.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solzhenitsyn</ENAMEX>'s
brilliant title for his exposé of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> forced-labor
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">camps</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arkhipelag GULag</ENAMEX> , he exploits the ugliness
inherent in one of these acronyms.  New terms
like apparatchik, kolkhoz, and khozraschet were invented,
old words like komissar, soviet , and tovarishch
were given new meanings, and some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>
words of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinds</ENAMEX> were borrowed into other languages,
including <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.

            Until fairly recently the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latinate Russian</ENAMEX> term
nomenclatura meant about the same thing as in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
and other languages.  The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1938</TIMEX> edition of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tolkovyi Slovar' Russkogo Yazyka</ENAMEX> defines
nomenclatura as The totality of appellations employed
in any specialization.  No other definition is
given.  But the noun has acquired a secondary meaning
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>: the privileged and operative personnel
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>.  It is with this secondary
meaning that the word has been borrowed from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, as well as into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and other
languages.

            There is logic in the semantic drift of a derivative
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> word for name to mean the top
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.  Like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>
joining a religious order, some old Bolsheviks
changed their names.  The ostensible reason for such
name changes was to confuse the tsarist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>, but
consideration of the root meanings of the names
chosen by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionaries</ENAMEX> reveals that the sobriquets
were at least as much noms de guerre as noms
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de</ENAMEX> plume or cover names.  Ulyanov became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenin</ENAMEX>, a
name probably suggested by a strike of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners</ENAMEX>
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lena River</ENAMEX>.  But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ilyich</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenin</ENAMEX> liked to be
called, was a relatively modest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>--as long as he
got his way.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dzhugashvili</ENAMEX> selected the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> word
for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stal</ENAMEX>', as the root of his revolutionary
name, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-</ENAMEX> in and -ov (-off, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-ev</ENAMEX>) suffixes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
surnames being only surname indicators.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rosenfeld</ENAMEX>
turned to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stone</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamenev</ENAMEX>) , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Scriabin to Hammer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Molotov</ENAMEX>),
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peshkov</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bitter</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorky</ENAMEX>).  Bronstein,
perhaps out of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> sense of irony, provided
the exception to prove the rule by borrowing
the surname of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Odessa</ENAMEX> jailer, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trotsky</ENAMEX>.
            

            Despite all that embalmers and mausoleums can
do, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are highly perishable, soon gone from
this earth, while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and geographic sites last
longer.  So as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ilyich</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> was eternalized in embalming
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fluids</ENAMEX> (or duplicated in wax, as some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skeptics</ENAMEX>
believe) and displayed much like the relics of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> under an impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mausoleum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Red</ENAMEX>
Square against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kremlin</ENAMEX> wall, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> created by
the westernizing tsar and named for himself with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">western</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> name, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sankt-Peterburg</ENAMEX> , was renamed
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leningrad</ENAMEX>.  Tsaritsyn was renamed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX>,
-grad being the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> equivalent of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-ton</NUMEX> or - burg
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  And other figures in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> pantheon
or nomenclatura were likewise immortalized: Samara
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">became Kuibyshev; Ekaterinburg</ENAMEX> was renamed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sverdlov; Simbirsk</ENAMEX> was renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ulyanovsk</ENAMEX> , a derivative
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenin</ENAMEX>'s original surname; Nizhnii Novgorod
was renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorky</ENAMEX>; and so on across the map of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and to a lesser extent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSR</ENAMEX>.
            

            As far as language, particularly toponymy, is
concerned, what has been called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Russian</ENAMEX>
Revolution was adumbrated by the recoiling in
horror from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX> and his works that followed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khrushchev</ENAMEX>'s address to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twentieth Party Congress</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</TIMEX>.  Stalingrad was renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volgograd</ENAMEX>.
Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toponyms</ENAMEX> created to honor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX> that are
listed in the index of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> atlas not one is
included in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionary</ENAMEX> of geographic
names.  But the way in which names were changed
in the period of destalinization differed significantly
from the reversion to tsarist names in the
period of glasnost and perestroika.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stalingrad</ENAMEX> did
not become again <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsaritsyn</ENAMEX>, nor did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin Peak</ENAMEX> revert
to an earlier name but rather was renamed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communism Peak</ENAMEX>.  Stalinabad, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of Tadzhik
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>, did regain its original Tadzhik
name of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dushanbe</ENAMEX> , but here the change was back
to the old name of a caravan stop and had nothing
to do with tsarist <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>.

            Going back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sankt-Peterburg</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leningrad</ENAMEX>
was reversion with a vengeance, literally.  It has
been said that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Petrograd</ENAMEX> (as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Petersburg</ENAMEX> was renamed with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slavic</ENAMEX> calque in
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX>) have lived out their lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leningrad</ENAMEX>
and will die in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sankt-Peterburg</ENAMEX>.  Sankt-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterburg</ENAMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">awkward</ENAMEX>, is un-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Slavic</ENAMEX>, un-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>, grating.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has hardly ever been called that in conversational
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peterburg</ENAMEX> is the name in common use
and is the title of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belyi</ENAMEX>'s novel about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.  An
informal, slightly irreverent name, corresponding to
such slangy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> contractions as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philly</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frisco</ENAMEX>, that spans the official mutations is Piter
(pronounced roughly like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English Peter</ENAMEX> ).

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, when I mentioned to a resident
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sankt</ENAMEX>-Peterburg my distaste for the restored
official name, she shrugged and remarked,
Well, the thing was to get rid of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenin</ENAMEX> .  Nothing
laid bare the latent <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">loathing of Communism</ENAMEX>,
even at its best, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> so strikingly as the change
by referendum from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leningrad</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sankt-Peterburg</ENAMEX> .
The change was made by popular demand despite
the plea of older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> that it not be made till
they, who had heroically withstood the German
siege of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leningrad</ENAMEX>, were dead and gone.  The renaming
of both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leningrad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalingrad</ENAMEX> was historically
and psychologically costly because nothing that has
happened in either <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> amounts to nearly so much
as their roles in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II.  One can hardly say,
“The defeat of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Paulus</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volgograd</ENAMEX> was
the turning point of the war.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">”  Conversely</ENAMEX> when cities
like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuibyshev</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> like
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kirov Theater</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gorky Street</ENAMEX> regained
their original names, it was rather as if they
had got back on track, as if they had been on a siding
since, say, the tsar and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> were murdered at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ekaterinburg</ENAMEX>.

            Like the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX>, the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian Revolution</ENAMEX> has brought changes to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> language that in some cases have spilled
over into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and other languages.  Glasnost and
perestroika are obvious examples of old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>
words that have acquired new, revolutionary significance
and been borrowed with their new meanings.
Examples of words drawn into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> vocabulary
by recent revolutionary developments are:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mafia</ENAMEX>, miting mass meeting and its verb form <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mitingovat</ENAMEX>',
and biznes and biznesmen in a non-pejorative
sense.  There is also a tendency to resurrect
words current in tsarist times and play around with
them.  For example, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> supplement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Izvestia</ENAMEX>
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 11-17, 1991</TIMEX>, has an article on divorce
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> that is titled<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">: Your Ladyship</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dame</ENAMEX>
Separation...

            During the period of destalinization <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin Peak</ENAMEX>
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pamirs</ENAMEX>, the highest point in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSR</ENAMEX> , was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">renamed Communism Peak</ENAMEX>.  One wonders whether
the mountain has been re-renamed or soon will be.
Capitalism <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peak</ENAMEX>?  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Free Market Mountain</ENAMEX>?  Well no,
the peak's next appellation will probably be a Tadzhik
name since the mountain is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tadzhikistan</ENAMEX>.
Examples of this kind of national restoration of local
names are the renaming of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stalinabad</ENAMEX> already mentioned
and the renaming of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyrgyzstan</ENAMEX>.
Formerly renamed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>
Frunze, it is now again called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bishkek</ENAMEX> , which I take
to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyrgyz</ENAMEX> for something.

            What is to be the fate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> language in
the fragmented, formerly brotherly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">republics</ENAMEX>?  I
have noticed that on televised newscasts <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Lithuanians</ENAMEX>,
Georgians, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Armenians</ENAMEX> almost always speak
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> or their interpreters in fluent <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cotton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> whom I met in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sankt</ENAMEX>-Peterburg
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, was negotiating with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uzbeks</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>.  At about the same time a young
Uzbek on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Petersburg</ENAMEX>
seemed perfectly at home in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>, I suspect more
so than he would have been in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uzbek</ENAMEX>.  On the other
hand, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> I met a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Lithuanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">film maker</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tashkent</ENAMEX> who spoke or would speak no <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> at
all.  Perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> in most of the former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>
will be grudgingly retained as an economic and
maybe even political lingua franca, somewhat like
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>.  Conceivably, especially in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> could become the working language
for trade and technology and even have a
cultural impact like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Demotic Greek</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>
basin in classic times.  But one can hardly
imagine that Sankt-Peterburg/Petrograd/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leningrad</ENAMEX>/
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sankt-Peterburg</ENAMEX> will ever be called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Peterston</ENAMEX> .
         
         
            Meditation on media



            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Green</ENAMEX>, in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> of his autobiographical
books, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ways of Escape</ENAMEX> , told this about his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evelyn Waugh</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evelyn</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diaries</ENAMEX> have been
joyfully exploited by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, a word that has
come to mean bad journalism.  Yes, of course.  But I
have noticed that is is principally the windier electronic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>, and advertising and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentry</ENAMEX>,
who like to use the word media (often pronounced
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEEja</ENAMEX>]), whereas those print <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> who have
sensitivity in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">English</ENAMEX> usage rarely use it.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World Dictionary</ENAMEX> gives this as
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of several definitions for medium: a means of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> that reaches the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and
carries advertising.  Then it points out that in this
sense, a singular form <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> (plural medias ) is now
sometimes heard.  I was afraid that something like
that would happen.  Perhaps before long the fancier
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> will begin to use mediae as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plural</ENAMEX>.  (Actually, that is the accepted plural for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> that is the middle coat of the wall of a blood
or lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX>.)

            
               Medium was used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> in the late 18th
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> with respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>, and media may
have had some use in that sense during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>.
But the plural has come into full flower only
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle years of this century</TIMEX>.  It was not
given in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX> edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Concise Oxford Dictionary</ENAMEX> ,
but is in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most recent editions.

            Now we have an unseemly <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horde</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">derivatives</ENAMEX>.
A few times I have been called a mediaperson because
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> I have done a little freelancing
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>.  (I have also been
called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POB</ENAMEX> print-oriented bastard because I have
only flimsy interest in radio and television, except as
a consumer of some of what they have to offer.)

            A word that could be useful if it were not so
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">abominable</ENAMEX> is mediamorphosis which someone in academia
coined to designate the distortion or transformation
of facts in some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>.  Then there
is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> event , an event staged deliberately and
cunningly, even manipulatively, for extensive coverage
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>: it has also been called a pseudoevent .

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who has qualities that make him attractive
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, especially television, is now
said to be mediagenic .  I once met at a conference a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who gloried in the title media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX>: I
learned that his principle duties were taperecording
and film-projecting.  If you are media-shy you do not
like being interviewed or reported on by mediapersons.
            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media</ENAMEX> fragmentation is the marketing concept
that there can be too many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> for a successful
sales campaign: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> are assailed by so many
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">appeals</ENAMEX> for their business that the campaign backfires.
This results when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> have not accurately
measured media weight , whatever that may be.
         
         

            But there is a word for it!  As a professional
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX> who has devoted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 40 years</TIMEX> to
the translation of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>, I beg to differ
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John R. Cassidy</ENAMEX> in There Just Isn't a Word for
It [ <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVIII ,2</NUMEX>].

            
               
                  Schedule .  In addition to horario, proyecto , and
programa , mentioned by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cassidy</ENAMEX> (and the
corresponding verbs, proyectar, programar ),
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spanish</ENAMEX> has the very useful one-word equivalents
calendario, agenda, and diario (for daily
schedule, of course).  And we should not forget
the always handy plan and planear .

               
                  Argument.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> dictionary reveals argumento
and argumentación as perfectly good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Spanish</TIMEX>
words with meanings equivalent to argument (in
the sense of reasoning, if not in that of dispute).
The verb argumantar to argue is in common use.

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esperar</ENAMEX> can mean to wait or to hope, but to
clarify the latter meaning one can say abrigo la
esperanza , literally, I have the hope.  As for the
meaning to expect, literate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>
know that--aside from using the noun
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">expectativa</ENAMEX> --the precise meaning is conveyed by
employing the reflexive no me esperaba, no se
esperaba , etc.  For example, I was waiting for the
bus and hoping it would come; but when it did, I
no longer expected it would be rendered as
Estaba esperando (or aguardando) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el</ENAMEX> autobús con
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">la</ENAMEX> esperanza de que llegara; pero cuando vino ya
no me lo esperaba.
               

               
                  Drop .  There is a very simple way to say it dropped
without using the self-accusatory I dropped it lo
dejé caer or the reflexive se me cayó: one can just
say se cayó.  Lo dejé caer does not necessarily
imply on purpose; it can also mean accidentally.
And se me cayó cannot be rendered, even literally,
as it fell itself to me: its meaning is something
more akin to it slipped away (or out of my hands)
and fell.  This type of construction is best handled
be se me fue , which may be translated as it got
away from me.

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> .  There is another word besides <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">presidente</ENAMEX>:
it is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> .  Or one can use jefe or regente .

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ganar</ENAMEX> .  In addition to ganar , to earn can be
rendered as cobrar, lucrar, or percibir.
               

                Kill the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian Democrats</ENAMEX>  Kill is not an
appropriate equivalent of mueran , which is better
translated as `death to': it is not an exhortation `to
wipe out,' merely an expectation or hope that the
object of execration go to an early grave.
            



         
         
            Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Harris</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIX</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>],
is quite wrong in thinking that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chevalier N. Kenne</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grant</ENAMEX> was using a bogus word.

            The expression <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beau-Tick</ENAMEX> (beautiful mark) is
commonly used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bordeaux</ENAMEX> with its many associations
with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Anglo-French Negociants</ENAMEX>.



         
         

            Clearly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Galef</ENAMEX>'s classics course was done
in translation, for had he read in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, he would
never have written <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pandora's Box</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pandora</ENAMEX>'s
Wine <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jar [The Niceness Principle</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVII</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>].  The
Greek word was (and is<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">) πíθoς</ENAMEX> ( pithos ) a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-footish
wine jar.  This error is a perpetuation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erasmus</ENAMEX>,
who published his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adagia</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX>) in which, inter
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alia</ENAMEX>, appears the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pandora</ENAMEX> story in which he mistakes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">πυξις</ENAMEX> ( pyxis ) a smallish boxwood box for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">πιθος</ENAMEX>, the
largest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> storage container.



         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English Adverbial Collocations</ENAMEX>,
            Most of those who learned <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as a native
language have not even the slightest idea of the
problems facing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who learn it as a foreign language.
Those who do not have to give a second
thought to the idiomaticity of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word order
can count themselves doubly blessed: the system
does not yield readily to rules, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native speakers</ENAMEX>
know from listening to the speech of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> who
have not quite mastered it, regardless of how long
they have been using the language.  Thus, it is with
the greatest tolerance and sympathy that one approaches
the review of a book that, in its first fifty
pages, attempts to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> with some inkling
as to what is going on in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word order,
whether the book was written by a native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> or
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigner</ENAMEX>.

            From a hint given on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gathers that
Kozlowska studied at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edinburgh University</ENAMEX>; from
her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> used in her discussion of
collocations, one gains the impression that she has
excellent control of the language.  But difficulties
begin to become apparent when one investigates her
analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> collocations.

            (For those unfamiliar with the term collocation ,
a quotation from the opening words of the book is
useful:


What is a collocation?  It can be said to be a set
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more words that frequently occur in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">juxtaposition</ENAMEX> and that seem to fit together.  We
say: a pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>, and a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, but a
handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.  We say drive fast and expand
rapidly,' but get tired quickly.  It will be noticed
that in each of these examples the meaning of the
various modifiers is basically the same, but different
words are used to express it, depending on
the word that is modified. [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p. 9</ENAMEX>]
            

            If we call the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of a given language
puts its words together idiom , then the process of
separating out the resulting phrases produces collocations .
An idiom , a combination of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more
words the meaning of which is different from the
literal meaning of the sum of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> (like
kick the bucket, red <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herring</ENAMEX> ), is distinguished from
the concept of idiom , which refers to the natural order
and combination of words by a native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>.
Unfortunately, we do not have separate words for
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>; in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, the red <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herring</ENAMEX> type is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conveniently</ENAMEX> called idiotisme and the conceptual
one is called idiome .  So far, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> have
shunned calling anything they say an idiotism, so
the ambiguity remains.)

            It scarcely needs me to point out that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
word order is indescribably <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, so it is no small
wonder that in a brief work like this, while the author
has labored mightily (and successfully) to identify
many of its features, she has inevitably failed to
cover all contingencies.

            The first disagreement I have with her is in her
use of the term homonym , which she defines as [a
word] looking the same, but differing in meaning
[from another word] [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p. 11</ENAMEX>].  She then proceeds to
call see physically and see comprehend
homonyms, as well as provoke anger and provoke
cause, run physical sense and run work, function,
and attack physically and attack verbally.  I
eschew the term homonym because it suffers from an
inherent ambiguity: a homograph is, to lexicographers,
at least, a word that is spelled the same as
another but has a different etymology ( bear <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 animal/</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bear 2</ENAMEX> carry; bore <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> carried/
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bore 2 drill/ bore 3 tire/</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bore 4</ENAMEX> tide wave); a homophone is a word that
sounds exactly like another but is spelled differently
( bear/bare; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bier</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>; bore/boar ).  In this context,
homonym , which is usually defined as a word that is
pronounced or spelled like another but having a different
meaning, is ambiguous, if not inaccurate, for
the implication is that homonyms are different
words.

            In her care to be precise, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> errs by
writing, The language is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>.  No <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> expressions
are given.  As it happens, of course, most of
what is described is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX> as well, so the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> part of the statement is incorrect.

            As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koslowska</ENAMEX> correctly points out, the choice of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adverb</ENAMEX> or adjective depends largely on the verb, adverb,
or substantive being modified.  The problem
arises with the enormous flexibility of metaphor accorded
by language: we can use provocative of
words, situations, and even low-cut dresses, depending
on the focus of emphasis of what is being provoked.
I should not like to have to face the task of
listing all the adverbs that might be used with the
verb run , even if it is restricted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>: smoothly,
quietly, silently, uninterruptedly, fitfully, intermittently,
efficiently, well, faultlessly, beautifully, perfectly,
poorly, badly, sluggishly, economically,
swiftly, rapidly, quickly --and then one must be prepared
to add the multi-word phrasal modifiers, like
without a hitch, as if it would never stop, like a clock,
like clockwork , etc.  There is not a finite number, I
am sure, but it must be a large number.  The author
is spared an exhaustive listing by the constraints of
her corpus (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>), which provides a
representative listing but barely scratches the surface
of the language.

            I would take issue with the analysis of [ACTIVE
ONLY, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTIVE/PASSIVE</ENAMEX>,] and [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PASSIVE ONLY</ENAMEX>] constructions,
if only because one of the nastiest areas of
grammatical analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> lies in distinguishing
between passives--that is, past participles--and adjectives.
We would say, for example, that gone in He
has gone is a past participle but an adjective in He is
gone (if only because <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> does not use the verb
to be as an auxiliary, the way <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> does); alleged
in it was alleged is clearly a past participle, but in the
alleged culprit it is an adjective.  It is set forth [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p.21</ENAMEX>]
that contrive something can be modified by brilliantly,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">neatly</ENAMEX>, or skilfully only in the [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PASSIVE</ENAMEX>], with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cleverly</ENAMEX>, ingeniously restricted to its [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTIVE/PASSIVE</ENAMEX>]
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reflexes</ENAMEX>; but that is not so, for we can say, They brilliantly<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/neatly/skilfully/treacherously/nefariously</ENAMEX>...
contrived to make the blame fall on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> .
The sentence <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Napoleon</ENAMEX> badly/ignominiously defeated
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Austrians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> is called wrong
on the grounds that badly and ignominiously (like
heavily, thoroughly, utterly) can be used only with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">passive</ENAMEX> verb; but we can say <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Napoleon</ENAMEX> defeated the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Austrians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> badly or ignominiously at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Austerlitz</ENAMEX> without violating natural <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> idiom.

            In a short section in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postmodifying</ENAMEX> adverbs
with adjectives are discussed, confusion is
confounded by juxtaposing stiff neck with We were
worried stiff .  The latter is not readily analyzable by
normal parsing, for if we are drawn to retain the
adjectival nature of stiff (instead of conceding that it
might be used as an adverb), we are obliged to characterize
worried as having taken on the guise of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">copula</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Language</ENAMEX> of Jokes
            That humor is a very serious business is certainly
borne out by the po-faced treatment the subject
receives in this analysis, though the fault cannot
be said to lie with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>.  The subject, alas, calls
for jokes to be explained, surely the most painful
experience that could be dreamt up by the mind of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">woman</ENAMEX> (just to give them equal time): Torquemada
do your worst!  It is hard to believe that anyone
could survive the mental thumbscrew that explaining
jokes inflicts: even if one has not got a joke and
its explanation is, in a sense, welcome--after all, no
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> likes to feel left out--what humor it might once
have possessed is crushed out of it.  I have tried to
write about humor and have found it such a humorless
chore that I have given up, usually after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
paragraph.  There is a great deal to be said about
jokes and humor in general, and it is hard to understand
why the subject is so exasperatingly boring.
Perhaps it is because there is a huge difference between
something's being funny and the explanation
of why it is funny, often given to someone who does
not think it is.

            Those jokes in one's native language that need
explanation are usually those that have references
outside the ken of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listener</ENAMEX>.  Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiaro</ENAMEX> treats not
only these but, when she hits full stride, the difficulties
in translating jokes between languages, where
even the explanations are often hard to get across,
because of either sociocultural differences, linguistic
differences, or both.  Puns are a common source of
jokes, especially those that have come to be called
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">one-liners</ENAMEX>.  In a recent letter in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunday Times</ENAMEX>
Books [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 October 1992</TIMEX>], a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">West Sussex</ENAMEX> headmaster
wrote as follows:


For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> it has been sub-editing practice to
headline pieces in a punning manner: in the
Books section of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 11</TIMEX>, for example, we
have, The art of friction, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tartar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reef</ENAMEX> encounters, Class menagerie.

My mild amusement at this is, after a couple of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, turning to mild irritation: any chance of
a change?
            

            Jokes involve the use of language most of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, though the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> acknowledges the existence
of visual jokes, too.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the shortcomings of the
book is the failure to cover, even minimally, the major
types of jokes.  For example, the current trend
among stand-up comedians--particularly as reflected
in the persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> television broadcasts
from various improvs--is simply to retail
common, ordinary, everday events and rely on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> to laugh appreciatively at the perception
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comedian</ENAMEX> to point out our foibles.  I suppose
that can be classified as a reaction of mild
amusement at the cleverness displayed, but it, too,
soon cloys.

            The author does not appear to have reached serious
conclusions: at the end of the book, in a short
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Conclusion</ENAMEX>, she offers some useful observations
about expressions of humor and about
the difficulties encountered by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> of English
as a foreign language in trying to impart to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
the linguistic skills required to understand English
literature; but these observations can scarcely be
termed conclusions, for no coherent theory has
actually been set forth in the book.

            Chiaro, always more that than oscuro in her
presentation, is not only not to be blamed for the
lack of theory but merits praise for having tackled a
subject that most of us dread and that has not been
treated satisfactorily by any of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX>,
from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Plato to Freud to Hockett</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX> al.  In such a brief
treatment, it is not possible to cover every aspect of
a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, multifaceted, albeit deadly subject.

            I found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> small errors, both on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX>:
homphone, and the transcription \?\/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tInguetI</ENAMEX>/

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford Companion</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> and all who share their interests
in language should own a copy of this outstanding
work.  Although it is not exhaustive in its
coverage, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCEL</ENAMEX> offers by far the most comprehensive
picture available of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language as
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX> draws to a close.  Still, for historical
reasons one should have liked to see entries for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ido</ENAMEX>,
Interlingua, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volapük</ENAMEX>, which do not merit even
mention under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ARTIFICIAL LANGUAGE</ENAMEX>; Syntactic
Structures , listed under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CHOMSKY</ENAMEX>, ought to have its
own entry, if only for the cross reference (though
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRANSFORMATIONAL-GENERATIVE GRAMMAR</ENAMEX> is in);
scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contemporaries</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yorick</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilks</ENAMEX> to important historical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX> like
Alford, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pegge</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tooke</ENAMEX>, would have provided informative,
useful entries.  (It hardly behooves me to
complain, as there is an entry not only for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>
but for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">URDANG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence</ENAMEX>; besides, I must accept
responsibility as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contributor</ENAMEX> of a number of the entries,
though, of course, I did not see the complete
work till it was published.)

            I see from the foregoing that I have, inevitably,
slipped into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">reviewer</ENAMEX>'s trap, so neatly laid by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> before me, of commenting on what is
not in the book under discussion rather than what is.
If I have not impaled myself on the upthrusting
points of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>' razor-sharp styli, I shall try to recover.
Some of the more interesting kinds of entries
deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>.  As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCEL</ENAMEX> is concerned with
language, per se, one would expect such entries to
treat the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>'s style, and, indeed, the entry on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MELVILLE</ENAMEX> does so; but the treatment is uneven: that
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CONRAD</ENAMEX>, aside from quoting a passage from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heart</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darkness</ENAMEX> , is barren of comment on language, and
that for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">BURGESS</ENAMEX> focuses on a quotation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nadtsat</ENAMEX>'
from A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clockwork Orange</ENAMEX> , with no mention of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s position (at least in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> ) as a language
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guru</ENAMEX>.  Admittedly, such entries are extremely difficult
to compose, but a proper treatment has certainly
been successfully attempted in the entries for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHAKESPEARE</ENAMEX> and for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORWELL</ENAMEX>.

            The occasional historical comment involving
history recent enough for me to have been a part of
it is not always exactly right.  For example, under
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANDOM HOUSE DICTIONARY</ENAMEX> is given the information,
Recognizing an opportunity in the national outcry
against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s New International <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merriam</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX> commissioned an expansion
of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American College Dictionary</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</TIMEX>)
....  As it happened, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> plans for the expansion
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACD</ENAMEX> were discussed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX>, when the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX> had no inkling of a forthcoming
new edition from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Merriam</ENAMEX>; as I have described
elsewhere, from its conception, the plans for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHD</ENAMEX> were entirely market-driven.  In the entry
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COMPUTER TYPESETTING</ENAMEX>, the information is given,
Starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, devices with film strips or
film wheels, containing images of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, were
widely used to produce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> copies on photographic
film.  More recently, the use of pre-made
film images has given way to cathode-ray tubes
which generate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> as requested.  The Photon
machine was in use during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>: I was
used for the composition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Funk Wagnalls</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictionary</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Edition</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</TIMEX>; I was
present at a demonstration of the (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mergenthaler</ENAMEX>) Linofilm
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1960s</TIMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hell</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digisetter</ENAMEX>,
which generated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> as requested from
what we might today call image bytes (to distinguish
them from pixels) was in use in the latter part of the
1960s: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> was certainly in operation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX> at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCall Corporation</ENAMEX>'s composition <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Princeton</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, driven by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA Spectrum</ENAMEX> computer.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> hopes that such factual slips can be
cleared up in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next edition</TIMEX> (or printing).

            It would have been useful had the entry FOLK
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ETYMOLOGY</ENAMEX> included a reference to Folk <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Etymology</ENAMEX>,
A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Verbal Corruption or Words</ENAMEX> Perverted
in Form and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Meaning by False Derivations</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mistaken Analogy</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Palmer Smyth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell & Sons</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>], <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1882</TIMEX>.  On the other hand,
now that I have provided the reference, I suppose
that there is no need to add it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCEL</ENAMEX> .

            Turning to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> about which I know little, I
was delighted by the full and informative article, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INDIAN</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">ENGLISH 1</ENAMEX>, but even that provokes a criticism
(probably felt by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX> even more strongly than
by me), namely, where is the Index?  There is such a
wealth of material buried in its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of articles
that remains inaccessible for lack of an Index that
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> despairs of the judgment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>.  I
know, I know: there is a thematic guide in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forematter</ENAMEX> and the two types of cross references at
the ends of the entries are extremely helpful; also, to
have added an Index would have run up the price of
the book by another <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 per cent</NUMEX> (or whatever).  But
so what?  What boots it to have paid <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 per cent</NUMEX> less
(I shall leave it to you to do the arithmetic) for a
book the depths and wisdom of which it is difficult to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plumb</ENAMEX> without an Index.  In the entry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHILOLOGY</ENAMEX>,
for instance, appears a reference to dead language,
but there is no mention of that entry at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAD LANGUAGE</ENAMEX>
(which, in any event, has only cross references,
quite appropriate in view of the fact that the
subject of the book is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>).  Still, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society of Indexers</ENAMEX> will spin in their groove--
and with justification!

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCEL</ENAMEX> is, surely, a prodigious undertaking
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom McArthur</ENAMEX>, aided by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feri</ENAMEX>, deserves
enormous credit for having produced a well-balanced
work.  Inevitably, one encounters articles
on relatively abstruse subjects that, owing to concision,
are not easily understood, chiefly because they
assume a level of sophistication not necessarily possessed
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>.  The lengthy article on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LITERARY</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRITICISM</ENAMEX>, though conveniently broken down into
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</NUMEX> sections, proved difficult reading for me.  In a
review of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCEL</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times Literary Supplement</ENAMEX>
[<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 December 1992</TIMEX>] it was suggested that inserting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asterisks</ENAMEX> alongside the terms that were treated in
their own entries would have helped; that is certainly
an accepted and often helpful practice in
longer encyclopedic texts, but it tends to interrupt
reading and clutters up shorter entries of the kind
encountered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCEL</ENAMEX> .  It was further suggested
that language is not best served by alphabetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>,
but that is merely a plea for much longer,
more comprehensive articles, which lie outside the
scope of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Companion</ENAMEX> .  Given the restrictions on
space, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> have done an admirable job.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> must bear in mind, too, that one of the
most difficult of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>'s responsibilities in such a
work is to rewrite articles submitted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX>,
with widely disparate writing styles, in order to
make them, if not uniform, at least compatible.  In
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fine</ENAMEX>, while there is no doubt that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Companion</ENAMEX>
will--and should--become a standard work on the
language, one must not impute to its function anything
more than its service as a guide: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
language is unimaginably vast, in its origins and history,
in its literary, philosophical, psychological, social,
and specialized applications, and in the descriptions
of its grammar, usage, dialects, and lexicon,
both historical and contemporary.  Consider that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> , which makes no pretensions at being exhaustive
or complete, occupies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> quarto volumes
in its description of the lexicon alone; consider
that a descriptive bibliography of the huge number
of lexicographical works on the myriad aspects of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> alone would occupy several similar volumes;
consider the multivolume works on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> grammar--by
Curme, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poutsma, Jespersen, et al.</ENAMEX>; consider
the immense corpus of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> literature and
of the writings about it; and then consider all the
material ancillary to the foregoing: the teaching of
English not only to foreign learners but to native
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> as well, the conventions of writing, punctuation,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">usage</ENAMEX>, and pronunciation, the multifarious influences
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> around the world,
the study of style and of literary devices, etymology,
etc.  It is difficult enough to assimilate all the categories
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with language without trying to cope
with their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and treatment.  In such an
attempt, there are bound to be points of disagreement,
arguments that important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> have
been accorded short shrift, minor inaccuracies that
will submit to later refinement.

            It is neither a matter of Don't shoot the piano-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX>,
he's doing the best he can, nor of If y'
know a better 'ole, go to it: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCEL</ENAMEX> stands as a
mighty effort and, in my over-all estimation, a
hugely successful <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at bringing together into a coherent,
cohesive work what is--at least--a superb
introduction to what must be acknowledged to be a
subject that is at once the most complex, changeable,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">elusive</ENAMEX>, technical, emotional, political, controversial
subject of all time.

            Those who have met with extracts from Notes
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queries</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> issues of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> have
pressed to see more.  As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N & Q</ENAMEX> is contained
in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> large octavo volumes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 500</NUMEX>
pages (excluding the Index) set in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-point type
(with reviews of books and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">periodicals</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-point),
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> will appreciate that it takes a while to read
through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX>' worth of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> and will be
patient as the volumes are mined for their gems of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">informative</ENAMEX>, occasionally entertaining matter.  On
the grounds that much of what we have to say today
has been said (or written)--often better--before, it
is hoped that the following will prove interesting
and useful to those who do not have ready access to
those early volumes (or the time to read them).  If
the punctuation seems a little odd, it is because it
has not been changed from the original to conform
to the modern practice.

            As will be seen, not every one of the following
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracts</ENAMEX> is from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> & Q occasionally, another, relatively
rare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> (though fortunately accessible in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>) has yielded an item of interest.

            It is well known that the origins of many words
still elude the most determined <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> in etymology,
but, taken as a whole, I should imagine that
the proportion of idiomatic expressions without confirmed
etymologies may be higher than that of
words whose provenance has not been established.
That is not for the want of speculative comment by
those who offered largely folk etymologies, which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> will recall so sorely vexed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walter</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Skeat</ENAMEX>.  The expression take down a peg is purported
to have originated in a time when peg tankards
were in popular use.  The following extract is
of interest:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peg-Tankards</ENAMEX> , of which I have seen a few still
remaining in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Derbyshire</ENAMEX>, have in the inside a row
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> pins <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> above another, from top to bottom;
the tankards hold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> quarts, so that there is
a gill of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ale</ENAMEX>, i.e., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> a pint <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winchester</ENAMEX> measure,
between each pin.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that drank
was to empty the tankard to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> peg or pin;
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> was to empty to the next pin, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">&c.</ENAMEX>; by
which means the pins were so many measures to
the compotators, making them all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX> alike, or
the same quantity; and as the distance of the pins
was such as to contain a large draught of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquor</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> would be very liable by this method
to get drunk, especially when, if they drank short
of the pin, or beyond it, they were obliged to
drink again.  For this reason, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Archbishop</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anselm</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canons</ENAMEX>, made in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1102</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Priests</ENAMEX> are enjoined not to go to drinking-bouts,
nor to drink to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pegs</ENAMEX>.  The words are:

the antiquity of this invention, which is at least as
old as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conquest</ENAMEX>.

            Perhaps I am missing something, but, in the event, it
is difficult to understand how the expression take
(someone) down a peg , which means demean (someone);
reduce (someone) in estimation, esp. his own;
puncture the self-confidence or arrogance of (someone),
unless it has changed somewhat over the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, could be connected with peg tankards.  It
seems unlikely to me that being more precise than
(someone) in a drinking competition could easily
translate into the modern sense of the idiom.  What
has happened, evidently, is that peg acquired the
sense of step, measure, degree hence take (someone)
down a peg meant reduce (someone) by a measurable
amount, and this is borne out by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> at
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">peg</ENAMEX>, sb . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3</NUMEX>, (with variants) which has citations going
back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1589</TIMEX>.  (As the quotation above indicates, the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1102</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Canons</ENAMEX> were in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>, thus not valid citation
fodder for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> .)  Those who would derive the
expression directly from the peg tankard sense are
thus not correct, for, while that attribution might
have been the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, the expression itself is
traceable only to a metaphor once removed from the

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diamond Jubilee Issue</ENAMEX>
            

            As it is unlikely that I shall be around to celebrate
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Diamond Jubilee Year of VERBATIM</ENAMEX>, it
seemed reasonable to celebrate while I can and to
reminisce, briefly.  As we all know, one characteristic
of time is that it stretches out before us in an
apparently interminable manner; yet, when one
looks back, it seems to have fled, disappeared, evaporated--heaven
knows where.  When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> was
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> published, though, I cannot recall having
looked forward much beyond the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> issue; now,
thinking back, I find it astonishing that seventy-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
numbers have preceded this one.  The life of a periodical
is quite unpredictable; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">periodicals</ENAMEX> change or
remain the same, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are more likely to
change than remain the same, with the consequent
disappearance of venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Punch</ENAMEX> ,
for example.  I do not have figures for the number of
periodicals that have met their end during the past
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades</TIMEX>, but I understand that there have been
many.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>, too, has had its ups and downs.  The
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> issue was mailed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> paid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX>; this issue
will go to more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7000</TIMEX>, including many outside
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> that are not numbered among
those listed in the audited <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> circulation report
required by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> to maintain a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second</ENAMEX>
Class mailing privilege.  According to a survey we
conducted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years ago</TIMEX>, each issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> is
read, on average, by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> (excluding
those that go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>).  Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Language</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Quarterly</TIMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 20,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 60</NUMEX>-odd
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.  Perhaps the most gratifying thing
about publishing it is that an average of more than
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 per cent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> renew; in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>,
the response has been <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 per cent</NUMEX> to the renewal
notices attached to certain issues.  I am given to understand
that, aside from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> associated with
membership in some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, anything beyond
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 per cent</NUMEX> is considered phenomenal.  Yet, we have
never sent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> renewal notice
followed up by a reminder <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks later</TIMEX>.

            On the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">page</ENAMEX> of Volume <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I, Number 1</ENAMEX>, I
promised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> (among other things) that their
names and addresses would never be sold to anyone,
on the grounds that everyone receives enough junk
mail as it is.  That promise has been kept: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companies</ENAMEX>
seeking our mailing list are told that the only way to
reach our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> is through advertising in the pages
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>.

            Looking at the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>, it might be
worthwhile noting that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> issue consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
pages; the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> volume contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> pages (issues
alternating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> pages) and a subscription
cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.50</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about ¥1.75</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>).  The price was
increased to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.00 (¥2.75</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years later</TIMEX>.
Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> publishes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">104</NUMEX> pages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> for
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$16.50 (¥11.50</NUMEX>)--not including this double issue.
For those who do not object to (very) rough statistics,
that averages out to an increase of from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.9¢</NUMEX>
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.25p</NUMEX>) per page to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15.9¢</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11.5p</NUMEX>) per page.  That
might seem like an unconscionable increase, allowing
for normal inflation, but the costs of paper
and postage (especially) have been driven up out of
proportion.

            The greatest cost we encounter is that of advertising,
which is not only expensive but yields
meagre results in comparison to the money spent.  It
is impossible to find another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> in which to
advertise that is quite like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>--that is, one
that reaches <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX>--so
we advertise in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> are
likely prospects and hope for the best.  Our current
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1992 to February 1993</TIMEX>) campaign has
cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $30,000 (¥20,000</NUMEX>), yielding, so far,
fewer than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX>.  It is not difficult to
calculate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> so expensively acquired are
not profitable till they have renewed for the third
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>.  Factor in the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 per cent</NUMEX> renewal rate, and it
can be seen that one must wait till <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth year</TIMEX>'s
renewal; although revenues from advertising and
book sales improve that slightly, they are offset by
the fact that we have recently begun paying all contributors

            The foregoing are facts, not a plea of any kind
for anything except to urge those who enjoy VERBATIM,
who have made it the highest-circulation popular
language <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> in the (English-speaking) world,
to encourage others who share their interest to subscribe
and to send in their renewals quickly.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>
makes an inexpensive gift for any occasion and is
especially enjoyed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> (who plunder it for
ideas) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> of long standing are aware that a few
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> we discontinued both <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The VERBATIM Book</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club Catalogue</ENAMEX> (because filling orders became enormously
complicated) and, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The VERBATIM</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Essay Competition</ENAMEX> (because the number
of high-quality <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">submissions</ENAMEX> was diminishing).
Beginning when the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Competition</ENAMEX> was terminated,
we established the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">VERBATIM Award</ENAMEX>, for the Pursuit
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scholarship</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lexicography</ENAMEX>.  Each <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> consisting of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three past-presidents</TIMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EURALEX</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Association for Lexicography</ENAMEX>)
select one or more successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX> from
among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EURALEX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to receive the award of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"></ENAMEX>1500 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $2500 and $3000</NUMEX>).  Since it was set
up, the entire award, at the discretion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX>,
has been made to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> each year.  It
may not be much, but, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>, it is, as they
say, the only game in town.

            Finally, it might interest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> to learn that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Edition</ENAMEX> , now
available on CD-ROM, lists <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">121</NUMEX> citations from VERBATIM
(through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Spring 1985</TIMEX> only).

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tomorrow</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Buzzwords</ENAMEX>



            Change is in the air, and change brings innovation
in language.  New terms spring up to reflect
new ideas.  I am betting that new business jargon
will flourish in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major categories in the
1990s: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human resources</ENAMEX>, internationalization, and
high technology.  The trends are becoming worldwide
among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> as free trade and the
lowering of economic borders serve as a catalyst for
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>.

            The function of business jargon is threefold: it
describes new phenomena ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knowbot</ENAMEX> ); it can
camouflage unpleasantness ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Decruitment</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIF</ENAMEX> ); or it
can simply amuse ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globasm, Glocal</ENAMEX> ).  Some of the
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> that prompt new words in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
language include the arrival of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> on the
world business scene and the penetration of computers
into our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life.  Admittedly, some people
use buzzwords as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> in the corporate jungle.
They pepper their speech with more and more of
these strange terms and words until their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> find them difficult to understand.  When
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adversary</ENAMEX> has to ask for clarification, the jargon-wielder
has won a point.

            Here is a selection from the future, organized in
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> most fertile categories.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPTIMIZING HUMAN RESOURCES</ENAMEX>

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RIF Reduction</ENAMEX> in force.  This is a euphemism
for sackings or firings.  It also works as a verb,
when the chief hatchetman reports, after a busy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX> news, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>.  We riffed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another thousand today</TIMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decruitment  Human resources</ENAMEX> jargon for
eliminating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>; the opposite of recruitment.  If
you are decruited , you are out of a job, but your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superiors</ENAMEX> feel better about not having fired you.
In fact, rule No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> for the surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> is
never to utter the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>word.

            
               right-sizing Reduction of payroll to conform
to the staffing needs of the moment.  This term
is loaded with sanctimony.  In effect, it says to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX>: Don't argue with us; just go away.  We
know what size <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> is right.

            
               skill-mix adjustment Reducing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s
strengths while also trimming away part of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>.  This term can dress up even the
most ruthless staff-cutting program.  Smart packaging
is half the battle.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOING INTERNATIONAL</ENAMEX>

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">globasm Compulsive</ENAMEX> international expansion
to achieve instant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gratification</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Companies</ENAMEX>
that seek recognition as world-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> sometimes
move hastily into international acquisitions
and alliances.  The heavy costs to the balance sheet
and the problems of culture clash can lead to a feeling
of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> and disappointment after the initial
euphoria.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCN  Parent-company</ENAMEX> national: an executive
of the same culture as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> flag.  As
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> begin to cross borders to work for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companies</ENAMEX>
outside their native <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, they bump into a
barrier they probably never imagined--the wall of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parent-company nationals</ENAMEX> that stands between them
and advancement.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCNs</ENAMEX> have a strong career
advantage: they went to the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, they use
the same references, they have the same mother
tongue.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, for example, you must know
your <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Hugo</ENAMEX>, your <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Napoleonic</ENAMEX> victories, and
your future conditional.  Tricky territory for the ambitious
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">foreigner</ENAMEX>.

            
               dochukaku  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> term for adapting
corporate ways to local conditions.  Originally, this
word was an agricultural term for adapting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> and
fertilizer to local soil conditions.

            
               transnational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> that merges
with a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>.

            
               multidomestic  An international company
that allows its foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subsidiaries</ENAMEX> autonomy and local
identity.  Different from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">multinational</ENAMEX> , in which
the emphasis is on worldwide homogeneity.

            
               cross-border alliance  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Links</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companies</ENAMEX>
beyond your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> borders.  A strong trend in the
early phases of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s burgeoning Single Market.
The cross-border <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX> in technology, marketing,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturing</ENAMEX>, even exchange of equity, is a good
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to test a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> before going for an outright
takeover.

            
               glocal  The fine balance between an international
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s global imperatives and local requirements.
Done well, it ensures the best of both
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worlds</ENAMEX>.  Probable a buzzword with a good future.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIGH TECHNOLOGY</ENAMEX>

            
               face time  Personal, face-to-face meetings
with human beings.  The opposite of communication
by electronic mail, voicemail, or straight telephone
talk.  A true computer nerd might say: I
talked with him for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compuserve</ENAMEX>, then
we finally got some good face time at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comdex</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX>.

            
               knowbot A smart software package that acts
like a robot.  Typically, a data-base searcher that
selects information according to personal interests,
which the computer deduces from every previous
search conducted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX>.  Very Orwellian.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zaitech  Financial</ENAMEX> engineering in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Japanese</ENAMEX>
technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> applied as a way of bolstering
profits.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zai</ENAMEX> finance + tech technology.

            
               Big Iron Tough talk among computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesmen</ENAMEX>
to designate large computer systems that cost
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of dollars.  Such machines are not exactly a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">disappearing</ENAMEX> breed, but they are increasingly replaced
by workstations that are growing steadily in
power and speed.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bird</ENAMEX> Talk



            When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> enters <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time,
many new things must be learned--and
learned fast.  Such things as where to go, what to and
what not to do, how to behave with one's fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX>,
and how to communicate with them.  Primarily
created as a self-defence measure against eavesdroppers,
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison slang</ENAMEX> in its own evocative way
describes common and not so common experiences,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">emotions</ENAMEX>, and professions.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inmates</ENAMEX> are not refused,
they are knockbacked ; they are not told to leave but
to Do <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> .  If one hears of someone having Gone into
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> , he has not entered anything other than a state
of extreme annoyance.  Also, we do not ignore somebody;
we blank him.  It is far better to act in a trustworthy
manner, thus one will be considered sound .

            Whilst many of these terms may have entered
the common vernacular, that is not the case with the
majority.  For, not only are convicts or screws prison
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to use them, they are likely
to be the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to know them.

            Each crime has its own particular name, so the
inmate in for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">screwing</TIMEX> burglary and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in for
hoisting shoplifting, can be distinguished from the
blagger robber.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prison</ENAMEX> has a fairly fluid social
structure, depending on the crimes committed, for
how long and how much was earned.  One thing is
certain though: however much <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thieves</ENAMEX>-- kiters bad
check passers, petermen safecrackers, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringers</ENAMEX>
car <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thieves</ENAMEX> who disguise and resell them--as well
as those already mentioned jockey for position, all
despise the nonce sex offender.

            As well as the nonce , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass informer</ENAMEX> is also
in danger, such danger being especially acute if the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">offender</ENAMEX> is dragged into a pad (a.k.a. peter cell) out
of sight and hearing of the kangas (short for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kangaroo</ENAMEX> ,
rhyming slang for screw ).  Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX> may
have to be put on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43s</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rule</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> covers those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX>
who are dangerous or in danger).  Though the prison
generally decides who is placed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43s</TIMEX>, an inmate
may place himself on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43s</TIMEX>, a process referred to as
Going on the numbers .  These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX> will be sent
down the block segregation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> and may even be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ghosted</ENAMEX> moved at short notice to another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX> (a.k.a.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shanghaied</ENAMEX> ).

            An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmate</ENAMEX> awaiting trial and thus on remand,
will be in browns wearing brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">denims</ENAMEX>, while the
convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmate</ENAMEX> will be in blues wearing blue denims.
Regardless of the color of his clothes, an e-man
one regarded as a potential or actual escaper will
be in pathches wearing clothes to which bright yellow
patches have been sewn.  Like the e-man someone
who is on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> A in maximum security will find
life very restrictive, with all his movements being
recorded in a little book.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cat</ENAMEX> A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is thus also
referred to as being on the book .

            The jail one is sent to is of a specific type.  One
starts off at a local the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX> in one's town or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>.
To prevent moral corruption, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.P.</ENAMEX>s young
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>: those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under 21</TIMEX> are placed in different
parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX>.  After sentencing, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.P.</ENAMEX> will go to a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.O.I. Young Offenders Institute</ENAMEX>, whilst his adult
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> may go to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dispersal</ENAMEX> , where longtermers
are assessed before being sent to other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jails</ENAMEX>.
If given a relatively light sentence, one could be sent
to an Open minimum security <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX>.

            The boredom of jail is alleviated if one puts
some puff (a.k.a. weed a.k.a. draw ) marijuana in
with some burn (a.k.a. snout ) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> to make a
joint marijuana cigarette, which, when washed
down with some hooch illegally brewed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> can
make the time pass a little quicker.  If such activities
come on Top are discovered or one is caught bang
to right in possession or vicinity, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perpetrator</ENAMEX> is
placed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Report</ENAMEX> (a.k.a. nicked ) charged with a
breach of prison rules and put on adjudication sent
before the prison <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> for punishment.

            After coming in, getting out is the major priority.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> counts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> to one's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.E.D. Parole Earliest</ENAMEX>
Date: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">jam</ENAMEX> roll parole is available after a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>

            Why <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">All Living Things Have Latin Names</ENAMEX>



            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most beautiful names in the animal
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">kingdom</ENAMEX> is the binomial for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> grosbeak ,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> that was thought to sing only when
night draws nigh.  Hesperiphona vespertina might
even be called a double binomial, because it says it
twice--western sound (song)/at eventide.  The binomial
not only gives information, it also dispels confusion.
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">The evening</TIMEX> Igrosbeak is also called the western
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening grosbeak</TIMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> hawfinch .  When
it appears in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> (and it has been seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX>)
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> get to call it the gros-bec errant , but
the name known throughout the world remains Hesperiphona
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vespertina</ENAMEX> .

            The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">other day</TIMEX> a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> brought me a dead
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moth</ENAMEX>.  I reached back to my childhood, and remembered.
It's a hawkmoth .  But she had already
named it.  She called it an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> moth, because it
had camouflage-like gray and green markings.
What other kinds of moths are there?  I went
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to find the moth book my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and I had
used.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia</ENAMEX>'s specimen was the big poplar sphinx
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moth</ENAMEX>.  Hawkmoths are also called sphinx moths .  But
big poplar sphinx does not say the same thing to everybody.
There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one thousand</NUMEX> different hawkmoths
and sphinx moths in the world, and there are
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over a hundred thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moths</ENAMEX> in other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of
moths, and among them there are many dozens of
poplar moths, big and little.

            The confusion can be avoided by using the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moth</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> name which was established <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> by a natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carolus</ENAMEX>
Linnaeus, and by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-name <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">namers</ENAMEX> who followed
after him.  Binomial nomenclature uses a generic
and a specific term, used to designate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
Only the binomial, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pachysphinx</ENAMEX> modesta , pins down
what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia</ENAMEX> found.  Its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, generic (general)
name is a bonus--giving extra information--because
it incorporates meanings for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the stages
of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>-- pachy - thick (it is wide-bodied) for
the adult insect, and the typical sphinxlike raised
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">caterpillar stage</ENAMEX>.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> name, the
(special) name, modesta , means modest in the sense
of free from ostentation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia</ENAMEX> was struck by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moth</ENAMEX>'s drab garb).  All we need to say is modesta
when we talk about this genus of moth to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>--all
over the world.

            Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> use different colloquial names
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.  A brown and yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterfly</ENAMEX> with blue
eyes on its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">front wings</ENAMEX> is called the common wood
nymph , or the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood satyr</ENAMEX> .  Other lepidopterists
named the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> satyr the blue-eyed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">grayling</TIMEX> , others,
the goggle eye .  Who is right?  The correct name, the
binomial, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cercyonis</ENAMEX> pegala , and that is the only
name that correctly identifies this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterfly</ENAMEX> everywhere,
to everyone.  Also, anyone discussing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satyridae</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterflies</ENAMEX> will know that just
plain pegala designates the goggle eye the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood satyr</ENAMEX> ,
the blue-eyed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">grayling</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood nymph</ENAMEX> .

            What happens when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Museum of</ENAMEX>
Natural History wants to talk to entomologists in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterfly</ENAMEX> we call the mourning cloak?
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> it is called der <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trauermantel</ENAMEX>; in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>
it is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">le</ENAMEX> morio (the moor); the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> named it the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camberwell</ENAMEX> beauty .  What <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterfly</ENAMEX> are they talking
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX>?  They are referring to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nymphalis</ENAMEX> antiopa , and
this binomial jumps all geographical boundaries,
crosses through every language, through all the alphabets,
and determines this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>'s true identity.

            We may not know how to read or write the letters
and symbols in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabian</ENAMEX>, or
other languages, but we do not have to when we
refer to living things, because the generic name and
specific name, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>, are the same all over the
world.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of tick, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pliny the Elder</ENAMEX>
called one of the foulest and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nastiest creatures</ENAMEX> that
be should be known to most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of the northeast
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>, because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ixodes</ENAMEX> dammini , the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> tick, is the vector for another dreadful <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>--the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spirochete Borrelia</ENAMEX> burgdorferi , which
causes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borreliosis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyme</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>)--the fastest-growing
infectious disease in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>.

            Perhaps a good start for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia</ENAMEX>'s further exploration
of the animal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> would be with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaurs</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>.  Young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> probably know
more than most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> about the huge lizards ( sauri )
that roamed this planet <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaurs</ENAMEX> (frightful lizards), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tyranno</ENAMEX>-saurus
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rex</ENAMEX>, is the tyrant lizard, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of them all.
And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felix</ENAMEX> ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Felis catus</NUMEX> ), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger</ENAMEX> ( Felis
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tigris</ENAMEX> ), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leo</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lion</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Felis leo</ENAMEX> ).  Canis lupus is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wolf</ENAMEX>.  Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>, domesticated, is bred in many
varieties: Canis familiaris is a family-type canine.  In
order to distinguish him from other varieties of Canis
familiaris I gave my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> an extra, varietal name:
Thunder.  I also, very unofficially, invented a joke
binomial for him: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fido fidel</ENAMEX> .  He is faithful <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Fido</ENAMEX>.

            Occasionally, the colloquial name, by itself,
adds to the information given in the binomial: the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">platypus</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ornithorhyncus anatinas</NUMEX> ) is a (ducklike,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bird</ENAMEX>-snouted) flatfoot.  There is a lot of information
in those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> words.

            The binomial for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia</ENAMEX> and me is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX> .
My varietal name is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia</ENAMEX>'s varietal
is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia</ENAMEX> , and it can be as long as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia Elizabeth</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith-Jones</ENAMEX> .  But the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">International Code</ENAMEX> of Zoological
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomenclature</ENAMEX> (for binomials in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal kingdom</ENAMEX>)
does not accept <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> varietal names because it
would create too much clutter.  Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> had to
invent our varietal names in order to single us out, to
call out to us.  Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> probably do the same,
for each other and for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.  I feel sure that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thunder</ENAMEX> has his own names for his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canis</ENAMEX> familiaris
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, and imagined <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>.

            Although we can sometimes take the shortcut to
just the specific name, it is better to use both names
at first mention, unless we are sure the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> addressed
know what genus we are talking about, because
many of the same specific names are used in
other genera.  Also, since most specific names contain
words that are more descriptive than those used
in the names of the various general--like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
words for modest, beautiful, amiable , and magnificent ,
for example--there are not enough to go
around, not just for other genera, but for the millions
of other living things in all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>,
orders, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> and vegetable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kingdoms</ENAMEX>.

            Our own, specific, descriptive name, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sapiens</ENAMEX> ,
comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> word to know.  We are supposedly
more knowing and wiser than other (lower?)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About a dozen</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals bear</ENAMEX> this same
specific name.  Our generic name, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo</ENAMEX> , is akin to
another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> name, humanus human and to humus
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">earth</ENAMEX>.

            All living things includes, of course, the vegetable
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">kingdom</ENAMEX>.  All <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, from seaweeds to <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">orchids</ENAMEX>,
follow the rules of binomial nomenclature.  Some of
the most interesting names, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, in the
vegetable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> are found, fittingly, in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orchidaceae</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.  Phalaenopsis amabilis , the lovable
moth-resembling orchid, or Trichocentrum
orthoplectron , the hairy-spurred <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cock</ENAMEX>'s spur orchid
(another binomial that tries to say it twice).

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Cynthia</ENAMEX>,

            I hope that when you get to high school you will
impress your biology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> with modesta , and that
your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, for all your life, will be  fidel,
domesticus, amabilis, agilis , and magnificens , even
sempervirens , but not too vociferus, tristis , nor
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neglecta</ENAMEX> .

            You may never see the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> that flies
through <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> while you dream sweet dreams,
but your namesake, the moth <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cynthia</ENAMEX> surely
hovers out there in the dark watching over you.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thesaurus of Traditional English Metaphors</ENAMEX>
            Works of this kind are more often the products
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, in the great tradition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brewer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Skeat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burger</ENAMEX>, and other--mostly earlier--
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, than of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkinson</ENAMEX>, identified as having studied <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Classics, Old</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Old Norse</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX>, worked as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forestry Commission</ENAMEX> woodman, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation</ENAMEX> that
evidently afforded him the time and solitude required
to concentrate on compiling and writing such
a work, though no indication is given of how long he
took to complete it.

            The main part of the book, arranged under
rather odd categories, covers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">486</NUMEX> pages; it is followed
by an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-page Index of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Themes</ENAMEX> (which might
have been made more accessible if placed at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">front</ENAMEX>); the rest consists of an Index of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keywords</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 40,000</NUMEX> according to the blurb.  Covered in
the text are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 20,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> sayings.

            Although many articles, theoretical essays, and
books have been written about metaphors, little effort
has been made to investigate them systematically:
as all of language is itself a metaphor (unless
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> believes in logomancy), one is continually confronted
in the compilation of an ordinary dictionary
with examples of semantic and linguistic changes (as
well as amelioration, pejoration, etc.) that are tantamount
to shifts of meaning that, loosely, could be
said to be metaphoric.  So it remains to see just
which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> sayings <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkinson</ENAMEX> has chosen to analyze
and record.  With few exceptions, they appear
to be phrases ( bridging loan, wide open, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hyde Park</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">railings</ENAMEX> ), adages or proverbs ( Don't be after breaking
your shin on a stool that is not in your way, When the
wheat lies long in bed, it rises with a heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, The
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> that comes from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same spring</TIMEX> cannot be both
fresh and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better</ENAMEX> feed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> drones than starve one
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bee</ENAMEX> ), and, occasionally, individual words ( <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beeswax</ENAMEX>
business, grape-<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vine</ENAMEX>, stagnant ).  Many of the last
are likely to be found in dictionaries, but modern
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> do not offer such useful treatment,
which essentially links to a word or phrase the culture
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who use it.

            It would be grossly unfair to continue without
quoting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s purpose, set forth in an Introduction,
which is all too brief considering the complexity
of the subject.  Here are some relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracts</ENAMEX>:


In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">everyday</TIMEX> life, metaphors take many different
forms, including similes (a nose as red as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cherry</ENAMEX>),
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proverbs</ENAMEX> (don't count your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chickens</ENAMEX> before they're
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hatched</ENAMEX>), transfer phrases (make heavy weather
of...) [,] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wellerisms</ENAMEX> (everyone to his taste, as they
said when the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> kissed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX>), metonymy
(the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">knife</ENAMEX> for surgery, the crown for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">royalty</ENAMEX>),
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synecdoches</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of cattle, a cut-throat), and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">swearing</ENAMEX> (bloody bugger!)...

            

            Particularly interesting are the kinds of metaphor
excluded:


As the main purpose of this collection is to
trace the origins of folk metaphor in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>,
nearly all examples of metonymy, synecdoche and
swearing have been omitted as being too marginal
or personal...

Metaphor is often used to warn or conceal from
a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>, as in your barn door's open.  In this
category are all euphemisms, but they contain the
seeds of their own decay.  Many good metaphors
have therefore been excluded because of this inevitable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ephemerality</ENAMEX>.  There are also <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> large
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> which are not admissible as metaphors
because they derive arbitrarily from sound-similarities
without the necessary sense-relationship.
These are based on puns like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> as a row
of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tents</ENAMEX>, and on rhymes--plates of meat etc.  Occasionally,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rhyme</ENAMEX> and reason happily coincide, as
in skin-and-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blister</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>, but for true metaphors
there must be some sense connexion, otherwise
the substitute word or phrase is merely
used randomly, or like a secret code.

Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of metaphors excluded is the
names of natural species such as footman and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>
moths, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>'s slipper, shepherd's purse, porpoise,
etc.

...

Purely literary metaphors have been excluded,
except for those which have become traditional
by general acceptance, as have many Shakespearean
sayings as well as titles and phrases from
modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>.

            

            The result is, in large measure, a catalogue of the
treatment once given in those older dictionaries that
might, in an entry for kink , have defined it as a condition
of a piece of wire then continued with,
hence, kinky twisted, abnormal, perverted.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkinson</ENAMEX>'s
entry for kink (under theme A3a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metal</ENAMEX>, different
metals ) is as follows:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kink Aberration</ENAMEX>, abnormality (as when straight
wire or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX> gets kinked.  Hence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinky</ENAMEX> =
perverted, eccentric to the point of abnormality.

            

            (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> matters of style should be noted here: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, all
entries are capitalized, which I find off-putting; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>,
runover lines are indented, necessary in a dictionary
but not in a work consisting of such short
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entries</ENAMEX>, with a resultant waste of space.)

            The thematic categories, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TINKER</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAILOR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOLDIER</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAILOR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RICHMAN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POORMAN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BEGGARMAN</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">THIEF</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT HOME</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT SCHOOL</ENAMEX>, and AT <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">PLAY</ENAMEX> added
to allow for entries not otherwise classifiable, I find a
bit too whimsical, especially when one finds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farmers</ENAMEX>,
Farm <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Animals</ENAMEX>, and associated subcategories
listed under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RICHMAN</ENAMEX>, while those who tend them
appear under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">POORMAN</ENAMEX>; the impression is that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> is subtly trying to pass on some sort of cynical
message.  Also, it is important to note that the
categories describe the literal content of the metaphor,
not the metaphoric aspect.  Thus, kick the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bucket</ENAMEX> is listed in the category E29e <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pork</ENAMEX> (because
of its presumed etymology, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Slaughtered pigs</ENAMEX> are
hung by the heels from the bucket or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX>)
while go west appears under G12e <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sunset</ENAMEX>, 
               bite the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dust</ENAMEX> (questionably defined as brought low) appears
at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">C10f Winning</ENAMEX> and losing the battle, 
               buy the
farm (which I cannot find in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> ) is listed under
E7a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land</ENAMEX> (where it is labeled as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americanism</ENAMEX>,
confuting my understanding that it originated with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.A.F.</ENAMEX>, early in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>), and cash in your chips/
checks goes under K77c <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roulette</ENAMEX> (which might be all
right for a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British English</ENAMEX> classification, but I think
that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> would expect to find it at K81
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Poker</ENAMEX> ).  Although the Index lists most expressions at
least twice ( kick the bucket is under both kick and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bucket</ENAMEX> , which is fine), it seems that no expression
appears more than once in the main section notwithstanding
any ambiguity or polysemy that might it
might reflect.

            Metaphors are the shibboleths of language and
culture, and proper imaginative, apt control of them
is an indicator of one's knowledge of both.  Within
a language, they can be culture-specific or cross-cultural,
dialect-specific or cross-dialectal.  kick the
bucket die, for example, is probably known in all
dialects of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>; kick into touch curtail or postpone
further treatment is unknown except to those
familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> idiom.  This seems an appropriate
place to describe a personal experience that took
place in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>, when I was far less conversant with
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> idiom than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> (though I hasten to point
out that it is unlikely that one can ever become fully
bi-dialectal any more that one can become perfectly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bilingual</ENAMEX>).

            The setting was a conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William Collins Sons</ENAMEX> (since renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collins Publishers</ENAMEX>),
in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">St James's Place</ENAMEX>, an engaging set of
creaky <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> situated between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stafford Hotel</ENAMEX>,
where we often repaired for dinner after our
lucubrations, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke</ENAMEX>'s.  Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX> lived in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suite</ENAMEX> at the top.  At the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">St</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>'s Place and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St James</ENAMEX>'s Street was the map
store owned by Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Chichester</ENAMEX>, of single-handed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sailing</ENAMEX> fame; across <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">St Jame's Street</ENAMEX> was--
still is--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boodle's</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentry</ENAMEX>; round the
corner was the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prunelle's</ENAMEX>.

            It was a time when those attending the meetings,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chiefly Jan Collins</ENAMEX>, who was managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX>, and I were trying to arrive
at a viable budget for the preparation and publication
of what was to become the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Collins English Dictionary</ENAMEX> .
Various other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> drifted in and out of
those meetings, which were held sporadically over
the course of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX>, but we <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> were the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief punters</ENAMEX> (as they say in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>).  The discussions
often went on for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all afternoon</TIMEX> and well
on into <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>.  Though hardier in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX>,
my constitution was somewhat affected by jet lag, as
I had usually arrived <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only that morning</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the day</TIMEX>
before from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>  On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> occasion, as our deliberations
were drawing to a close after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many months</TIMEX>,
we came to a particularly niggling point of dispute
regarding the cost of some phase of the project--I
have forgotten which--and, in frustration and exasperation,
I burst out with, You must realize that if
you want to earn <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a penny</NUMEX>, you've got to spend a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">penny</ENAMEX>!, whereupon, much to my consternation, all
those present fell about laughing merrily.  [Note to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>: spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a penny</NUMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> idiom
meaning go to the lavatory, obviously a reference
to the ubiquity of pay toilets.]

            Despite his protest to the contrary, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkinson</ENAMEX>
has included a number of what can only be termed
literary metaphors in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Myth</ENAMEX> that include
Primeval, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germanic</ENAMEX>, and
Celtic, but no <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX>.  The coverage is uneven: sop
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cerberus</ENAMEX> is in, but not <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pegasus</ENAMEX> (even though it is
not couched in a metaphoric phrase that I can think
of).  In the category of proper names, which are not
specifically excluded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Introduction</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brillat</ENAMEX>-Savarin
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Escoffier</ENAMEX> are missing as metaphors for
great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chef</ENAMEX> as is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einstein</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of my
personal favorites in this category is mithridatism
the gradual immunization of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> against a poison
by administering it over a long period in small,
but increasing dosages; it refers to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mithridates IV</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great of Pontus</ENAMEX> (? <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">133-65</ENAMEX> BC), who, according
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Justinian</ENAMEX>, foiled a conspiracy by just such a
method before dispatching the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conspirators</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>
at dinner by dosing the food with poison that had no
effect on him.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nouns</ENAMEX> and verbs are the mainstay of
the metaphors treated, but adjectives are in very
short supply.  One could write a longish essay on the
allusions conjured up by the words <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickensian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kafkaesque</ENAMEX> ,
and Orwellian , yet none of these (among
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of others) are represented.

            I see that I have fallen (not inadvertently, I fear)
into the trap that I so often criticize in other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>,
namely, scoring a work for what it does not contain
instead of sticking to commenting on what is
there.  Despite some disappointments, inevitable in
any book (even those one has written himself) but
especially in one that by its very nature could never
approach completeness, it must be said that what is
included is well and concisely handled, useful, and
interesting.  Still, I return to my point regarding certain
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">omissions</ENAMEX>, for the purpose of a reference book is
not solely to serve those who wish to look up metaphors
they hear, but ones they read, as well.  Focusing
on the living language alone (according to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blurb</ENAMEX>) is a bit of a conceit, for what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are
saying in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montgomeryshire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northumberland</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, even if it accurately represented, is
scarcely the living language for most English
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>.  It must be said that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> when every
schoolchild was (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least</NUMEX>) exposed to classical mythology
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Books</ENAMEX> have been superseded
by an obsession with education applicable only to
commercial pursuits, the syndrome reflected in,
Why do I have to study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaucer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>
to become a car mechanic or an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">astronaut</ENAMEX>?  The
liberal arts need not be regarded as ends in themselves--that
is, to produce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>--but to create well-rounded human
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX> who are passing familiar, if only subconsciously,
with the underpinnings of their society
based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bedrock</ENAMEX> of their culture.  Of course, if
by culture we mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> familiarity with the names
of the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> rock hits and the details of latest episode
of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Neighbours, Roseanne , or Coronation Street</ENAMEX>,
then n one of this is important.  At worst, modern
education ignores totally the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>; at best,
it pays his tutelage mere lip service.

            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> may know of my involvement
with a related work, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allusions</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cultural</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Literary</ENAMEX>,
Biblical , and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Historical : A Thematic Dictionary</ENAMEX> [with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick G. Ruffner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gale Research Company</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982, 1986</TIMEX>], an attempt to provide a quick reference
guide to what can be termed metaphors, consedering
the present context.  Each entry in that
book was accompanied by a source reference, more
than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> of which were listed in the Bibliography
preceding the Index.  I miss such documentation
in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkinson</ENAMEX>'s book: the only indication we
have, from How to use the book, is in a vague mention
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heywood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ODEP</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Apperson</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skeat</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX> edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaucer</ENAMEX>--vague because
the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> of this book may not be familiar
with these cryptic references, and no bibliographic
details are provided.  There are no references to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> in the text at all.  For the casual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>, they
might not be important, but their absence makes the
book virtually useless for the serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX>.
Moreover, I, for one, should like to know the source
that pins down to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> the expression so low he
could sit on a cigarette paper and hand his <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">feet</NUMEX> over
the edge: given no gloss, does this refer to low depressed,
low degraded, or low abject?  Who is it
that has attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pepysian</ENAMEX> He cannot
whip a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> but I must beat the tail of it?  On what
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkinson</ENAMEX> accept that in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pimlico</ENAMEX> order
is used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>?
It is possibly because of my predominantly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> upbringing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> that I have never
heard that or several other expressions, similarly attributed,
having to do with persimmons (which were
always something of a joke, in any event).  Spill the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX> is in wide use in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> and should not be
labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> shows it as orig. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
Lollipop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> school crossing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX>, on the
other hand, carries no label at all, which one takes to
mean it is universal, but it is virtually unknown in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.  On the other hand, returning to omissions.
I should have expected to find born on the wrong
side of the blanket and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fiddler</ENAMEX>'s green , among others.
To the best of my knowledge, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> expression
is come up smelling like a rose survive an ordeal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">untainted</ENAMEX> or even in enhanced condition; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkinson</ENAMEX>
has smell like a rose [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Amer</ENAMEX>] be pure and innocent.
(Why is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CB Confined</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barracks</ENAMEX> listed among the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbreviations</ENAMEX> in the forematter?  Surely it cannot
appear as a label, since the phrase, which is literal,
hence not an entry, is a description of a military punishment.
Perhaps the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> is testing to see if we
are alert.)

            Such are the problems with a new work, and
they might be corrected and improved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> editions,
for which one profoundly hopes there proves
just reason.  One is bound to wonder, For whom is
the book intended?  At the price, it is clearly not to
be found in the book rack at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, and one
must conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> are the likely target.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX>, some might have the resources to pay
that much for such a book, but I daresay there are
not many, and at that price one would expect a cloth
binding rather than the hard paper binding provided.
