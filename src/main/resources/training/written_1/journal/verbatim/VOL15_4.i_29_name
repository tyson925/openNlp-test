            If these vignettes strike sympathetic chords, then
science fiction's words, phrases, and lore have permeated
your thought and language.

            This will not be a discussion of the science fiction
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>) dialect, which is certainly a legitimate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, given
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> for whom blaster, phaser, warpdrive,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyborg</ENAMEX> and the like are familiar terms.  It will,
rather, treat those words and phrases, created in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>,
which are now in common non-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX> use.

            There has been no entirely satisactory definition
of science fiction: all proposals seem to exclude some
work which individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> would include in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">genre</ENAMEX>.  It has been suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX> include only those
stories which would be invalidated without their scientific
content;  that fiction which concerns science,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, and the impact of science on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>;  that
which explores alternate existences (whether future,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extraterrestrial</ENAMEX>, or only in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>' minds) based on
facts and logical progression via scientific method.   As
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Potter Stewart</ENAMEX> wrote of
hard-core pornography, so do I of science fiction: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúI</ENAMEX>
shall not attempt further to define the kind of material
...embraced within that short-hand description.
...But I know it when I see it.‚Äù  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> cited
here as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX> have been classed as such by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>
reputable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> alternate existence, the ideal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, was considered
by the ancients (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plato's Republic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aristophanes</ENAMEX>'
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Birds</ENAMEX> ).  However, it is Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas More</ENAMEX>'s
speculative work of political science and sociology-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Utopia</ENAMEX>
(from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> ou - `not' + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">topos</NUMEX> -`place')--which
became, generically, the impossibly
perfect place.  The looking-glass image of utopia--dystopia--has
provided more numerous additions
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> lexicon.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aldous Huxley</ENAMEX> excerpted
words from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">The Tempest (‚ÄúHow</ENAMEX> beauteous

The phrase brave new world is now synonymous with
a nightmarish, technically advanced society.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>

            Orwell constructed an alternative future in his vision
of the totalitarian <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nineteen Eighty</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> .  The
work has given <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> a small lode of unpleasantries:
the title itself connotes a society marked by government
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">terror</ENAMEX> and propaganda destroying the public's
consciousness of reality (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED Supplement</ENAMEX> also accepts
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984 and 1984-ish</TIMEX> as adjective forms); that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s
official language, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Newspeak</ENAMEX> , now indicates
the propagandistic or ambiguous language of, among
others, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broadcasters</ENAMEX>
(‚Äúrevenue enhancement‚Äù for ‚Äútax increase,‚Äù etc.); the
twisting of minds to the capacity to accept the validity
of utterly contradictory opinions or beliefs, or double-think ;
the book's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Brother</ENAMEX> , implies an
apparently benevolent, but really ruthless, omnipotent,
and omniscient state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>.

            Taking an uncomfortably short speculative step
was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Kubrick</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX> film, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúDr</ENAMEX>. Strangelove, Or
How <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
The title character of this dark comedy seriously considered
plans for and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù</ENAMEX> results of nuclear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">holocaust</ENAMEX>; such contemplation is strangelovian .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert A. Heinlein</ENAMEX> envisaged a more optimistic
future in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX> novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Stranger in a Strange Land</ENAMEX> .
Its Martian-reared main <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character advocates</ENAMEX> advancing
the empathic capability of the human mind so
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> can grok `embrace others with profound, intuitive
understanding.'  It is not clear why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinlein</ENAMEX> chose
such an unpretty word for such a beautiful concept
(maybe it is euphonious to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martian</ENAMEX> auditory apparatus);
it has, nevertheless, caught on.

            Monsters have had starring roles in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX> from its
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early years</TIMEX>.  The archetypal uncontrollable creation-gone-amok
is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frankenstein</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monster</ENAMEX> , commonly familiarized
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frankenstein</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">incognizant</ENAMEX> who
thus disserve <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Shelley</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Baron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frankenstein</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">monster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creator</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Baron</ENAMEX> may have been misguided,
but at least he was not so mad a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> as to
experiment on himself.  That lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insight</ENAMEX> was shown
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Louis Stevenson</ENAMEX>'s good <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dr. Jekyll</ENAMEX> ( The
Strange <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1886</TIMEX>), whose
impressive bodily transformations to his evil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alter ego</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">made Jekyll-and-Hyde</ENAMEX> descriptive of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who alternately
demonstrate good and evil behavior.

            The recurrent motif of time travel came to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fore in H.G. Wells</ENAMEX>'s The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Machine</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX>), considered
by some <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first work</TIMEX> of true <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells</ENAMEX> prototype,
a controllable time-space <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>, is used allusively
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forecasters</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Day Lewis</ENAMEX>, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúHow Poetry Began‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX>), wrote ‚ÄúTo find this out,
we'll have to jump into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Machine</ENAMEX>, put its gear

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> into prehistoric time.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>).  Einsteinian
relativity theory, with its absolute maximum speed
limit (the speed of light), might have put an end to
such speculation had it not also included the concept
of curvature of space.  It was then but a small step to
the space warp, permitting faster-than-light (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTL</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros</ENAMEX>) travel by straight-line shortcutting across the
curves of space.  Except for its origin, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interplanetary Society Journal</ENAMEX>, space <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">warp</ENAMEX> has been
restricted to fictional use.  (After all, you can't have a

            The battles between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> have featured
manifold armament.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Authors extrapolated</ENAMEX> from

weight of this fictional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">weaponry</ENAMEX> has popularized the
death ray from its pulp <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX> origins to serious contemporary
consideration as laser technology has advanced.
Weapons <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> have tried to euphemize and deromanticize
the terminology: death rays are called
‚Äúbeam weaponry,‚Äù and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> antimissile defense system
is SDI (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Strategic Defense Initiative</ENAMEX>), despite the
public acceptance of the catchier Star Wars (from the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX> film).  We also should recognize <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX> as the
source of zap, which is used as noun, verb, and interjection
to indicate `sudden power' (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n.</ENAMEX>), to `kill in a

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cryptic</ENAMEX> Toolbox



            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy-five years ago</TIMEX>, the daily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New, York World</ENAMEX>
presented its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> with a new kind of puzzle
that consisted of a grid and a list of clues.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Word-Cross</ENAMEX>,
as it was called, started its existence as just
another little <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> supplement feature, with no
pretensions to permanence.  Yet it was to become the
progenitor of the now ubiquitous crossword puzzle.
The make-up of the grid has undergone various modifications
in the course of time but the rules of the game
have remained unchanged.  As for the clues, they were
called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúdefinitions</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and that indeed is what they
were.-- Or were they?  On closer inspection, classic
clues appear to be divisible into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.  First,
there are synonyms, like rooster for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COCK</ENAMEX>.  Admittedly,
there is no such thing as perfect synonymy, but the
meanings of many pairs of words are close enough for
this term to be used in the context of a pastime like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crosswords</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, a clue may name a class of objects
which includes the answer, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COCK</ENAMEX>.  A more
specific class, e.g., male <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> , makes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> easier,
whereas a more general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>, e.g., animal , would
complicate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">puzzler</ENAMEX>'s task.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> comprises
definitions proper.  Such a clue for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COCK</ENAMEX> might
read: adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> of the domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fowl</ENAMEX> .

            Crossword puzzles soon become very popular in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, and perhaps even more so in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>.  But
someone must have felt that all this was too simple for
our overtrained brains.  Straightforward definitions (of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> varieties were gradually replaced by play on
words, ambiguous phrasings, jumble games, and other
verbal pranks.  A clue for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COCK</ENAMEX> might thus come to
read: number one in the pecking order dominates hens
and crows (a quizzical statement, unless the word
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">crows</ENAMEX> is read as a verb) or even: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and a bullock's rump found in a coop (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> letter
of cow plus last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> letters of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bullock</ENAMEX> ).

            The uninitiated may find these examples too bizarre
for words.  Still, the idea has caught on so well
that most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> now offer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> crossword
puzzles <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>.  One is in the classic style, commonly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">labeled ‚Äúconcise‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúquick.‚Äù  The other is of the newer,
playful genre, often referred to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as ‚</NUMEX>Äúcryptic‚Äù; but this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">designation</ENAMEX> is by no means universal.  (A well-known
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> language <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> prefers the term ‚ÄúAnglo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>)
In some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, puzzles of this type are
called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúcryptograms</ENAMEX>,‚Äù a name we shall use from here
on.  This article is an attempt to catalogue the main
tools currently applied by cryptic puzzle-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solvers</ENAMEX>.

            A cryptogram clue can be a simple pun, like

            
               A .  A message that goes from pole to pole (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> letters) =

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TELEGRAM</ENAMEX>

            In most cases, however, it consists, as the previous
examples suggest, of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, each hinting at the
answer in its own way.  This construction makes sense
since each hint by itself is generally so vague or open-ended
that it evokes more potential answers than a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">puzzler</ENAMEX>'s brain can handle.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> such hints, however,
have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only a few</NUMEX> possible answers in common, so that
the solver can concentrate on them and pick the most
probable <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.  This quest for the correct answer rests
on intricate mental processes which require no elaboration.
Our purpose here is rather to devise a classification
of the various types of clue elements (CEs) currently
in use.

            Let us start with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of clues encountered
in the classical crossword puzzle: synonyms,
superordinates, and definitions.  Here are some examples
of their cryptic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>:

            
               B .  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) = TWAIN

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> CE ( A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> ) indicates a class to which
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWAIN</ENAMEX> belongs; the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> ( <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ) offers a synonym of
another possible meaning of the answer.

            
               C .  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> who counts and recounts (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TELLER</ENAMEX>

            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEs</ENAMEX> are telescoped.  Each of them defines a
separate meaning of the answer.

            These are really old-time clues in new apparel; once
wise to the system and having enough vocabulary entries
in one's head (or a thesaurus handy on the shelf),
it is not too difficult to decode them and arrive at the
answer.  The going gets tougher, however, as the two
meanings of the answer move further apart:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.</ENAMEX>  
               This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX> is quite a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) = LETTER

            The mechanism is clear: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LETTER</ENAMEX>, (`one
who lets'), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LETTER</ENAMEX>, but the two LETTERs
differ in both meaning and origin.  (Note that
some double-dealing has also gone on with the word
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> !)  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> layer of camouflage is added in:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.</ENAMEX>  
               Straight commotion (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) = ROW

            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROWs</ENAMEX> differ in pronunciation as well as in
meaning and origin.

            Just as disorienting are clues where the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> meanings
of the answer belong to different word classes:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F.</ENAMEX>  
               A more successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gambler</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) = BETTER

            To mystify solvers even more, puzzlers may use words
in an uncommon but perfectly legitimate sense, especially
by attributing to certain words ending in -er the
quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">noun</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomer</ENAMEX> (for `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">flower'</ENAMEX>), butter
(for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">`ram</ENAMEX>'), or even flower (for `river') are recurrent
examples, but solvers must always be on the alert for
new traps of this type:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G.</ENAMEX>  
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than one</NUMEX> anesthetic (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) = NUMBER

            All of the above techniques rest, in one way or
another, on the meanings of words.  They make up the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">class of Semantic Clue Elements</ENAMEX>.  Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>,
equally important in cryptoland, is that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Graphic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clue Elements</ENAMEX>.  Here, the object of play is the written
form of the answer, or, more precisely, the letters of
which that form consists.  The best known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of
this class is undoubtedly the anagram:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX>  
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Victim</ENAMEX> of injustice could be grounded (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8</ENAMEX>) =
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNDERDOG</ENAMEX>

            The words could be which precede the anagram
grounded have a special function.  They inform solvers
(if they get the message!)  that an anagram is lurking
nearby.  Indeed, convention requires that anagrams
(and all other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Graphic CEs</ENAMEX>) be accompanied by such
flags.  On the other hand, the cryptogram <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX> is
free to conceal these signals in all sorts of phrasal
hocus-pocus:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX>  
               Overturned vote overturns all votes (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) = VETO

            Some other anagram flags are broken, strange, unorthodox,
maybe, kind of , and a source of .  There are
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of them, and new ones are being concocted
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>.

            Many anagrams spread over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more words:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.</ENAMEX>  
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brave Tim</ENAMEX> changed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8</ENAMEX>) = VERBATIM

            These are particularly tricky when short words, like
articles or pronouns, are involved:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K.</ENAMEX>  
               An event is organized for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9</ENAMEX>) = VENETIANS

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX>  
               You can't take it with you--neither can I, unfortunately
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11</NUMEX>) = INHERITANCE

            A subvariant of the anagram is the inversion:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX>  
               On reflection, the parts will hold together (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) =
STRAP

            
               On reflection is a flag to indicate that parts is to be
read backwards.  Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inversion</ENAMEX> flags are coming
back, returning , and going West .  Purists admit these
only for answers that run horizontally in the grid.  For
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúdown‚Äù</ENAMEX> words, they prefer turning up, traveling
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX> , etc.

            It is worth noting that the first element of clue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX>
consists of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> words On reflection the parts .  The
comma, correctly inserted between reflection and the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">,</ENAMEX>
may mislead, but such punctuational conflicts are considered
perfectly legitimate, or even a piquant little
feature.  We shall return to this point <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>.

            Another type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Graphic CE</ENAMEX> is the acronym:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.</ENAMEX>  
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of the unassuming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Knights Society</ENAMEX>
can be a source of delight (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TURKS</ENAMEX>

            
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of is a flag intended to draw the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">solvers</ENAMEX>'
attention to the initial letters of the words following it,
where the answer lies for the taking.  The most common
flag for acronyms is, as one would expect, initially .

            The acronym does not stand by itself in the crypto
repertoire.  In fact, it is the key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a whole
family of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Graphic CEs</ENAMEX>, all with their own specific
flags to indicate whether the answer is to be composed
from last letters, middle letters, or other word fragments.
An idea of the way they work has been given in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the introductory examples (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX>-bullock
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">creature</ENAMEX>).

            A relatively new graphic technique is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwich</ENAMEX>.
The letters of the answer are left in their original order
but spread over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more words:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">O.</ENAMEX>  
               Lakeside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> located inside the embankment or on
top of it (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>) = <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TORONTO</ENAMEX>

            or contained in a single word:

            
               P.  
               A small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Czechoslovakia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) = <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">OSLO</ENAMEX>

            Besides inside and in , common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwich</ENAMEX> flags are part
of and some of .

            As the above clues demonstrate, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Graphic CE</ENAMEX> should
be accompanied not only by a flag but also by a Semantic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CE</ENAMEX>.  This conventional rule also holds for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> class, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Phonic Clue Elements</ENAMEX>.
These are based, just like the traditional pun, on
homophony:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Q.</ENAMEX>  
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Critique</ENAMEX>, one hears, of a theatrical entertainment
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) = REVUE

            Somewhat more involved is:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.</ENAMEX>  
               It sounds in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sense (or in none) like simplicity
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9</ENAMEX>) = INNOCENCE

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phonic CEs</ENAMEX> are not very often used, probably because
all suitable flags ( I hear, it sounds, say , etc.) are so
obvious that they threaten to give the game away.
In the above <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">tour d'horizon</ENAMEX>, not all aspects of clue
setting have passed in review.  Nothing has been said
about the artful ways in which abbreviations, chemical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">symbols</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> numerals, musical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">notes</ENAMEX>, etc., may be used in clues.  Hardly any attention
has been paid to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-element clues.  (There are even
one-word clues, some of them particularly witty.)  No
examples have been given of answers that consist of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> word.  More important, no mention has
been made of the possibility of chopping the answer
into convenient pieces which are separately represented
in the clue by anagrams, synonyms, etc.

            Just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> real-life example:

            
               S.  
               <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, home of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> without
perverse words (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9</ENAMEX>) = ?

            Solution:


words = terms (synonym)
perverse = flag for anagram
anagram of `terms' = MSTER
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADAM</ENAMEX>
without = outside (!)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ADAM</ENAMEX> outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MSTER</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AMSTERDAM</ENAMEX>
            

            Clue syntax deserves a more thorough examination
than space permits; but perhaps it would be best to
comment on some aspects of the ethics of compiling
clues.

            The first commandment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">puzzlers</ENAMEX>' bible
reads: Thou shalt not waste words.  A well-constructed
clue comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only</NUMEX> words necessary for conveying, in a
deceptive way, the information solvers require to find
the answer.  Adding fillers to distract them is considered
unfair.  As for the answer, it is better to avoid very
learned or rare words unknown to all but a few lexicographers.
The idea is to test the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">solvers</ENAMEX>' skill in deciphering
clues rather than their familiarity with the
recondite recesses of the lexicon.  (This being said, one
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> does offer a special obscure-words
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">puzzle</ENAMEX>, probably for the benefit of glossarial masochists.
Little wonder it appears under the name of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mephisto</ENAMEX>.)

            On the other hand, it is admissible, as we have
already seen, to throw solvers off the scent with an
occasional comma in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">‚Äúwrong‚Äù place</ENAMEX>.  The same
holds for other dividers, such as colons, dashes, hyphens,
and blanks.  Likewise, a bit of juggling with
apostrophes, quotation marks, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX> is permitted,
always on the understanding that no punctuation
or spelling rules are infringed.  And it goes without
saying that clue texts may be arranged in such a way
that, at first sight, certain words appear to belong to a
different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inflectional form</ENAMEX> or word class than is actually
the case when the clue is unlocked.  In fact, this is
an essential part of the fun.  This feature has already
been demonstrated in the very first example (the cock
that crows) and also in clue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F. Clue J</ENAMEX> offers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> further
instances: at first reading, changed is suggestive of being
a past tense but after analysis it is identified as a
past participle (serving as an anagram flag); likewise,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX> shifts from adverb to noun.

            Let us end with a specimen in which several of the
above techniques are represented:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX>  
               Part of his imprint appears in absurd Anglo-Saxon

            Money of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Realm</ENAMEX>



            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the privileges of national sovereignty is the
right to name your <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s money, or to rename
it when the old name has acquired unpleasant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>.  The tourist struggling at each border
crossing with exchanging <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s money for that
of another and trying to fix values may not have the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> then to wonder why a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s money is called
what it is.  [Because so many languages are involved,
the names that follow are as used in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications of the International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX>.]

            Money originated in the form of coins.  For many
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> the current names of what is now mostly
paper money are based on characteristics of the old
coins or refer to the fact that the weight of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> or
gold coin was often an indication of its value.  The
pound sterling (the money of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>),
for example, apparently derived from a pound weight
of silver pennies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX> period which had a
star on them (Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>: steorling `coin with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>').
The concept continues through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> word for
`weight': peso (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolivia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chile</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dominican</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">peso</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guinea</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bissau</ENAMEX>).

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of money names with other
weights is common: ouguiya (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mauritania</ENAMEX>) means
`ounce.'  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyat</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burma</ENAMEX>) is the name for a measure of
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16.33 grams</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baht</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX>) is a weight of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 grams</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drachma</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>), which literally means a `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handful</ENAMEX>,'
is a weight of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.2 grams</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dirham</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Emirates</ENAMEX>) derives from drachma .

            As in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>, the currency names of
other economically powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> have long historical
roots.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franc</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>) goes back to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">coin inscribed ‚ÄúFrancorum rex</ENAMEX>,‚Äù `<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franks</ENAMEX>.'  Dollar (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and some other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>)
derives from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> Thaler , a coin of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th century</TIMEX> which was minted in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joachimsthal</ENAMEX>.  The word dollar was used in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX> to refer to the thaler and became the
official name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> monetary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> by an
Act of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Congress</ENAMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 6, 1785</TIMEX>.

            
               Denarius , a coin of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, evolved into
dinar , the name used by many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> of the eastern
Mediterrean which were once part of, or near, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ancient Roman Empire</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algeria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahrain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">People's Democratic Republic of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tunisia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX>).  Denarius was the source
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">abbreviation</ENAMEX> d for the former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> penny.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shilling</ENAMEX> , another coin in the predecimal pound sterling
may take its name from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> coin, solidus ,
worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 25 denarii</NUMEX>.  It is the money name in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tanzania</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX>, and, spelt <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schilling</ENAMEX> ,
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metical</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mozambique</ENAMEX>) was a former
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of currency.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dobra</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o Tom√©</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pr√</ENAMEX>≠n-

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cipe</ENAMEX>), meaning `double,' is the name of a former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>
gold coin.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pataca</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau</ENAMEX>) stems from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX> coin, the patacoon.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kina</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Papua New Guinea</ENAMEX>) originated from shell
money used for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> along their coast;
the cedi of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghana</ENAMEX> means `small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shell</ENAMEX>' after the former
use of the cowrie <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shell</ENAMEX> for money.  The complete panel
of cloth formerly used for money is the meaning behind
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dalasi</ENAMEX> (The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gambia</ENAMEX>).

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX> was a common term used throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>
for a weight of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, usually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about eight</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ounces</ENAMEX>.  The name was adopted by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1875</TIMEX>
for a coin to replace the thaler.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> retained
the name even when its monetary value sank so low
that currency reform was necessary.  It was the reichsmark
that suffered through the hyperinflation of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1922-23</TIMEX> when the cost of mailing a letter went from
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reichsmark to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 months</TIMEX>.  The rentenmark ,
secured by the industrial and agricultural
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, was introduced in limited
amounts to stabilize the currency.  (This was the creation
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Banker</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht</ENAMEX>.)  The name continues
in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Deutsche mark</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">mark</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">East</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>).  When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> reformed its economy several
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, the former name of its currency was
changed from cruzeiro to cruzado , the meaning `little
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>' to `crusade' being of less importance than the
similarity of the names in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX>.

            The names of some kinds of money are associated
with the metal originally used or some related feature.
`<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gold</ENAMEX>' is the meaning of guilder (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>) and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ztoty</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>).  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanskrit</ENAMEX> for `wrought <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>' is the
basis for rupee (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seychelles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sri</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lanka</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">rupiah</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>), and rufiyaa (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maldives</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birr</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ethiopia</ENAMEX>) means `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>' and was the name used
beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX> to designate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria</ENAMEX>
Theresa thaler, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Austrian</ENAMEX> coin which circulated in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Red Sea</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ringgit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>)
means `serrated, milled,' a characteristic of the edging
on coins.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kip</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Laos</ENAMEX>) means `ingot.'  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruble</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>),
which literally means `stump,' might have denoted a
piece cut from a silver <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>.

            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> name their currency to honor people
famous in their history: bolivar (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX>) for the
liberator of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sim√≥n Bol√≠var; sucre</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ecuador</ENAMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonio Jos√© de Sucre</ENAMEX>, chief lieutenant
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bol√≠var</ENAMEX> and liberator of what is now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ecuador</ENAMEX> at the
battle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pichincha</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1822</TIMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quito</ENAMEX>; col√≥n (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Salvador</ENAMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christopher Columbus</ENAMEX>; balboa
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa</ENAMEX>, discoverer of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Ocean</ENAMEX>; lempira (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Honduras</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> who is a national symbol of liberty
and valor for resisting the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> advance; and c√≥rdoba
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nicaragua</ENAMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco Hern√°ndez de C√≥r</ENAMEX>
doba, first acting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>.  Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balboa</ENAMEX> and C√≥rdoba
were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arias Da</ENAMEX>\?\ila, who subsequently executed them.
The regional characteristic of using the same idea
as a basis for selecting a currency name is apparent
from these <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Central American</ENAMEX> neighboring
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.

            It is true also in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scandinavia</ENAMEX> where the money
name is crown: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">krona</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iceland</ENAMEX>), krone (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX>).  The only non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scandinavian</ENAMEX> ‚Äúcrown‚Äù
is koruna (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Czechoslovakia</ENAMEX>).  Regional patterns emerge
elsewhere: in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> the money names mean
`round, circular': <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">yen</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>), won (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX>), tugrik
(<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mongolia</ENAMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">yuan</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">People's Republic of China</ENAMEX>).  In
the last, the currency name is actually renminbi , `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s
money,' with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of account being the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">yuan</NUMEX> .
The meaning `royal' appears as riyal (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qatar</ENAMEX>), rial (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen Arab Republic</ENAMEX>), and
further south as lilangeni (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swaziland</ENAMEX>).

            History and myth provide another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> for
names.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shekel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>) was a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Babylonian</ENAMEX> weight which
became the coin of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hebrews</ENAMEX>.  [Exodus <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30:13 ‚</TIMEX>ÄúThis
they shall give...<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a shekel</NUMEX> after the shekel of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sanctuary</ENAMEX>: (a shekel is <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty gerahs</TIMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> shekel
shall be the offering of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>]  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taka</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangladesh</ENAMEX>),
literally `money,' derives from tonka of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX>
language which was the money of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX>
Mughal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> in circulation in what was then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bengal</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inti</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX>) was the sun god in the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Peruvian</ENAMEX>
religion; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX>'s previous money was sol , <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> for
`sun.'  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rand</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>) is the now common name
for the witwatersrand , the site of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> fields
found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 19th century</TIMEX> and the original source
of its wealth.

            For most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> the easiest source of a name for
their money has been to take that of another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>,
either because of proximity and association with a
strong economic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> or because of a former colonial
relationship.  Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgium</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX>, and
Luxembourg use <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">franc</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> and The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX>
choose dollar .

            The name dollar is used by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barbados</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belize</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brunei</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fiji</ENAMEX>,
Guyana, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jamaica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Liberia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Solomon Islands</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX> and
Tobago, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zimbabwe</ENAMEX>.  As the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Caribbean</ENAMEX> dollar ,
it is used by several small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> who do not have
their own money: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antigua, Dominica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grenada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nevis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent</ENAMEX>.

            The name pound is used by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cyprus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX>
(as punt ), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lira</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>) is a contracted form of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
word for `pound' libra.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX> traveled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as markka</NUMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX>.

            The names franc and guilder spread only to their
former colonial areas.  The franc appears in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burundi</ENAMEX>,
Comoros, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Djibouti</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Guiana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guinea</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malagasy</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rwanda</ENAMEX>, and as a common currency of the CFA
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communaut√© Francaise Africaine</ENAMEX>), comprising <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Benin</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burkina Faso</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cameroon, Chad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central African</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">C√¥te d'Ivoire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Equatorial Guinea</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gabon</ENAMEX>,
Mali, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Niger</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">People's Republic of the Congo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Senegal</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Togo</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guilder</ENAMEX> is used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands Antilles</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suriname</ENAMEX>.

            Money has also derived its names from things or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lev</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bulgaria</ENAMEX>) and leu (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Romania</ENAMEX>) mean
`<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lion</ENAMEX>.'  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Escudo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape Verde</ENAMEX>) means `shield.'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quetzal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guatemala</ENAMEX>) is the national <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> and guarani
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paraguay</ENAMEX>) the name of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forint</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>)
means `flower,' pula (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Botswana</ENAMEX>) `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX>,' austral
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX>) `southern,' and kwanza (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Angola</ENAMEX>) `<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>.'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwacha</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zambia</ENAMEX>) means `<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX>' in reference
to the ‚Äúdawn of freedom.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Tala</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Samoa</ENAMEX>) is
derived from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollar</NUMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pa'anga</ENAMEX> was selected by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tonga</ENAMEX>.  As reported in The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> , ‚ÄúTonga has
decided against calling its new decimal currency unit
the dollar because the native word tola also means a
`<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>'s snout,' the `soft end of a coconut,' or, in vulgar
language, a `mouth.'  The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>...has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX>
alternative meanings--a `coin-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX>' and, not
surprisingly, `money.' ‚Äù

            When no other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> seems suitable, nations
name their money after the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naira</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigeria</ENAMEX>) is
derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s name as is probably Vatu
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanuatu</ENAMEX>).  More direct is afghani (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>), leone
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Leone</ENAMEX>), and the ultimate in directness, zaire
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zaire</ENAMEX>).
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">English Is A Crazy Language</ENAMEX>



            <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is the most widely spoken language in the
history of our planet.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English</ENAMEX> has acquired the
largest vocabulary and inspired one of the noblest bodies
of literature in the annals of the human race.

            Nonetheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is a crazy language.  In the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">crazy English</ENAMEX> language, the blackbird hen is brown,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blackboards</ENAMEX> can be blue or green, and blackberries are
green and red before they are ripe.  To add to this
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insanity</ENAMEX>, there is no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> in buttermilk , no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> in
eggplant , neither worms nor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> in wormwood , and
no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> in a hamburger .  (In fact, if somebody invented
a sandwich consisting of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham patty</ENAMEX> in a bun, we
would have a hard time finding a name for it.)  And we
discover more culinary madness in the revelations that
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">muffins</ENAMEX> weren't invented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fries</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pastries</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX>.  In this
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">weird English</ENAMEX> language, greyhounds aren't always
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grey</ENAMEX> (or gray), a ladybug is a beetle, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea pigs</ENAMEX> are
neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pigs</ENAMEX> nor from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guinea</ENAMEX>, and a titmouse is neither
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammal</ENAMEX> nor mammaried.

            Language is like the air we breathe.  It is invisible,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inescapable</ENAMEX>, and indispensable; yet we take it for
granted.  But when we take time to explore the vagaries
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, we find that hot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> can be cold, darkrooms
can be lit, nightmares can take place in broad

<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>--no bath, no room--it is still ‚Äúgoing to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            
Why is it that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> can man a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, but a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> cannot ‚Äúwoman‚Äù one, that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> can father a
movement, but a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> cannot ‚Äúmother‚Äù one, and
that a king rules a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> , but a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX> does not rule
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúqueendom‚Äù</ENAMEX>?  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> is someone who writes, and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stinger</ENAMEX> is something that stings.  But fingers do not
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúfing,‚Äù grocers ‚Äúgroce,‚Äù hammers ‚Äúham,‚Äù</ENAMEX> or humdingers
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äúhumding.</ENAMEX>‚Äù  If the plural of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse is mice</ENAMEX> , why
don't we live in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúhice‚Äù</ENAMEX>?  One tooth , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> teeth ; so why

Kleenex , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two ‚ÄúKleenices‚Äù</NUMEX>?  If someone rang a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bell</ENAMEX> , why don't we say that she also ‚Äúflang‚Äù a ball?  If
she wrote a letter, perhaps she also ‚Äúbote‚Äù her tongue.
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> taught , why isn't it also true that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">preacher ‚Äúpraught‚Äù</ENAMEX>?  If she conceives a conception and
receives at a reception , why didn't she grieve a ‚Äúgreption‚Äù
and believe a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúbeleption‚Äù</ENAMEX>?

            If a horsehair <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mat</ENAMEX> is made from the hair of horses
and a camel's hair brush from the hair of camels, from
what is a mohair coat made?  If a vegetarian eats <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>,
what does a humanitarian eat?  If pro and con
are opposites, is congress the opposite of progress ?

            In this confusing language of ours noisome doesn't
mean `noisy,' meretricious is anything but meritorious,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">penultimate</ENAMEX> is less ultimate than ultimate , but invaluable
is more valuable than valuable .

            No wonder that we <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> are constantly
standing meaning on its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>.  We delete negatives
and say, I could care less , when we really mean, `I
couldn't care less,' and we add gratuitous negatives
and say, I miss not seeing her , when we really mean, `I
miss seeing her.'  Any book that keeps us literallly glued
to our seat actually keeps us figuratively glued to our
seat, a near miss (which is a`collision') is a `near hit,'
something that falls between the cracks would in reality
land on the planks or the concrete, a big traffic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bottleneck</ENAMEX> is a `small bottleneck,' and a hot cup of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> is really a `cup of hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>.'  We get up in the
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> and put on our shoes and socks and then go
back and forth .  No, we put on our socks and shoes and
then go forth and back .

            Because <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> seem to have our heads
screwed on backwards, they constantly misperceive
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>.  They fall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> over heels in love when we
really mean heels over <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> in love.  If they are disappointed
or afraid, they try to keep a stiff upper lip
when it is the lower lip they are trying to control.  They
complain that things are being done behind their
backs , but nothing can be done ‚Äúin front of their
backs.‚Äù  And they try to avoid doing things ass back-wards
when `ass backwards' is the only way that anyone
can do anything.

            Sometimes you have to believe that all English
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> should be committed to an asylum.  In what
other language do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> drive in a parkway and park
in a driveway ?  In what other <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> can the
weather be hot as hell <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> and cold as hell the
next?  In what other <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> can quite a lot and quite
few mean the same thing, as well as loosen and unloosen,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ravel</ENAMEX> and unravel, passive and impassive,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flammable</ENAMEX> and inflammable, shameful and shameless
(behavior) and What won't he do next ?  and What will
he do next ?  In what other language are overlook and
oversee opposites but a slim chance and a fat chance
the same?  Why is it easier to assent than to dissent but
harder to ascend than to descend ?  Is it really true that
if you decide to be `bad forever,' you have chosen to be
bad for good , and if you are wearing only your right
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shoe</ENAMEX>, your right one is left.  Right?

            When the sun or moon or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> are out they are
visible, but when the lights are out , they are invisible.
A piece of cloth that wear may be the same as a piece
of cloth that won't wear .  Trimming a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> may involve
cutting it away or, especially around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>, adding
to it .  When we wind up a watch, we `start' it, but
when I wind up this disquisition, I shall `end' it.

            Does it not seem just a little bizarre that we can
make amends but never just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one ‚Äúamend‚Äù</NUMEX>; that no
matter how carefully we comb through history, we can
never discover just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one ‚Äúannal‚Äù</NUMEX>; that, sifting through
the wreckage of a disaster, we can never find just one
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúsmithereen‚Äù</ENAMEX>; and that we never contract a single
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúheebie-jeebie‚Äù</ENAMEX>?  Which reminds me to ask a burning
linguistic question.  If you have a bunch of odds and
ends and you get rid of or sell off all but one of them,
what is left?

            What do you make of the fact that we can talk only
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about the nonexistence</TIMEX>, never the existence, of certain
items and concepts?  Have you ever run into someone
who was ‚Äúcombobulated,<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äù ‚Äúchalant,‚Äù ‚Äúsheveled,‚Äù ‚Äúgruntled,‚Äù</ENAMEX>
or ‚Äúgainly‚Äù?  We all know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are no
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">spring chickens</ENAMEX> , but where, pray tell, are the people
who are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúspring chickens‚Äù</ENAMEX>?  Have you ever met someone
who was ‚Äúgreat shakes,‚Äù who could ‚Äúcut the mustard‚Äù
and ‚Äúdo squat,‚Äù who ‚Äúwas your cup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and whom
you ‚Äúwould touch with a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ten-foot pole‚Äù</NUMEX>?  Do you know
anyone who is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúslouch‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúwould hurt a fly‚Äù?

            If the truth be told, all languages are a little
crazy.  As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walt Whitman</ENAMEX> might proclaim, they contradict
themselves.  That is because language is invented,
not discovered, and, as such, language reflects the creativity
and fearful asymmetry of the human mind.  In
his essay <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúThe Awful German Language</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Mark Twain</ENAMEX>
spoofs the confusion engendered by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> gender by
translating from a conversation in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunday</ENAMEX>
school book:


GRETCHEN: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilhelm</ENAMEX>, where is the turnip?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WILHELM</ENAMEX>: She has gone to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>.
GRETCHEN: Where is the accomplished and beautiful
English maiden?
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WILHELM</ENAMEX>: It has gone to the opera.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twain</ENAMEX> continues:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚Äúa tree</ENAMEX> is male, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX> are female, its leaves are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuter</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> are sexless, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are male, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> are female--tomcats
included.‚Äù

            Still, you have to wonder about the crazy English
language, in which your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> can burn up and burn
down at the same time, in which you fill in a form by
filling out a form, in which you add up a column of
figures by adding them down , in which your alarm
clock goes off by going on , and in which you first chop
down a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>--and then chop up a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Correspondents</ENAMEX>


            
It all began with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenin</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Russian Revolution</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, and journalistic expertise devoted
to these supremely important phenomena of the
twentieth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> began with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir Ilich Lenin</ENAMEX>.
But as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> journalism is concerned, that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pronouncement</ENAMEX> is not quite correct, because more often
than not <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> began and for an
embarrassingly long time continued not with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir</ENAMEX>
or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ilich</ENAMEX> (as the founding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bolshevik</ENAMEX> is sometime affectionately
called, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasant</ENAMEX>-fashion by his patronymic)
but with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nikolai Lenin</ENAMEX>.  The error flawed the record
beyond newspaper reporting.  For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Columbia</ENAMEX>
Encyclopedia , in an edition last copyrighted in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX>, has an appropriately long entry for ‚Äúthe founder
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSR‚</ENAMEX>Äù under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nikolai</ENAMEX> .  How this mistake
came about in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place no one is certain.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lenin</ENAMEX>
did use the pseudonym <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. Lenin</ENAMEX> , among scores of
others, and maybe a self-styled authority assumed that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> . stood for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nikolai</ENAMEX> , a name that may have been
suggested by that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">continental</ENAMEX> usage the letter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> , corresponding to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX> in
the English-speaking world, is sometimes used for a
name an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> does not wish to reveal.  At any rate,
the mistake, trivial in itself, tended to discredit a good
deal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> reporting about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>
among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who knew better.  After all, if the bourgeois
press could not get even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenin</ENAMEX>'s name right, how
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reliable</ENAMEX> was it about anything else in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSR</ENAMEX>?

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Decades later</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist</ENAMEX>
Party of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> was assumed by Nikita
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sergeevich Khrushchev</ENAMEX>.  By then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kremlinology</ENAMEX> had
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">matured</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> had all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khrushchev</ENAMEX>'s
names right, though there were several ways to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transliterate</ENAMEX> and pronounce them in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  To the
horror of some Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, however, he was at
least once quoted out of context as having threatened
to ‚Äúbury‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.  And he did say that.  But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
verb he used in a sentence that was more a bellicose
boast than a threat was pokhoronit', which means
`bury,' all right, but in the sense of the verb in ‚Äúwe
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">burried Grandma</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>.‚Äù  When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nikita Sergeevich</ENAMEX>
bragged that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSR</ENAMEX> would bury the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>, he meant
that technologically and economically the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX>
would leave us in the dust, would be around for our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">funeral</ENAMEX>, not that they would put us <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six feet under</NUMEX>.

            If our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> would attain true excellence in selecting
English expressions to correspond to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">originals</ENAMEX>,
it should exercise more care about designating
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúRussia‚Äù</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúRussians</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSFSR</ENAMEX> (for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Socialist Republic</ENAMEX>) is only one of several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republics</ENAMEX>,
which are more like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
than what we generally mean by ‚Äúrepublic,‚Äù and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX>
(sometimes redundantly called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúethnic Russians‚Äù</ENAMEX>)
make up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSR</ENAMEX>.  So referring to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSR</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúRussia‚Äù</ENAMEX> is a mistake
on the order of calling the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Britain ‚ÄúEngland.</ENAMEX>‚Äù  However, the boundaries of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tsar</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> known as ‚ÄúRussia,‚Äù were
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> the same as those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>; it
was occasionally known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúthe Russias</ENAMEX>,‚Äù as in the formula
‚ÄúTsar of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russias‚Äù</ENAMEX>; thus, this particular
confusion comes naturally.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> himself is said
to have had to apologize while making a speech in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ukraine</ENAMEX> when he referred to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ukraine</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúRussian</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
This faux pas might be likened to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queen of England</ENAMEX>'s
saying in an address before <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Welsh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄúAs we
here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> well know ...‚Äù

            The problem of drawing a distinction between
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSR</ENAMEX> has been solved by
borrowing the word <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as an adjective
or a noun meaning a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and not an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>,
except rarely as in the designation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Soviet</ENAMEX> .  In
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian Sov√</ENAMEX>©t means basically `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX>' and `<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX>'
and by extension `<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>'.  It never means a `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSR</ENAMEX>' or any other kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>,
though its adjectival derivative sovetskii can be used
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substantively</ENAMEX> alone or followed by chelovek `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>,' to
mean a `<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>.'  So the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soviet</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> noun sov√©t or much
more often to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> adjective sovetskii in their
many inflected forms.

            Currently <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> words are challenging
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">correspondents</ENAMEX>, among others, to find English
equivalents: perestroika and glasnost '.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of
these Gorbachevian buzzwords can be handily calqued
into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as `restructuring.'  Glasnost ', though, is
more difficult.  As a calque it would come into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
as vocalness , which is no word.  It is not a new word in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>.  The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1935</TIMEX> edition of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-volume Tolkovyi
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slovar' Russkogo Yazyka</ENAMEX> (`<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Explanatory Dictionary of</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian Language</ENAMEX>') defines glasnost' as: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúAccessibility</ENAMEX>
to public discussion and evaluation; publicity.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  I</ENAMEX>
can think of no single <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word that quite corresponds
to this definition.  Publicity perhaps comes closest.
But since both perestroika and glasnost' from our
point of view do not mean `restructuring' and `publicity'
generally, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> words do to us, but rather
refer to reforms specifically initiated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> words, particularly glasnost', are usually
borrowed into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> unaltered (except in pronunciation).
There are, of course, precedents for this sort of
intact borrowing: pogrom, ukase, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intelligentsia</ENAMEX> , and
muzhik for example.  And in the same way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> have helped themselves to our sex, jazz,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lynch</ENAMEX> , and business .

            Apropos of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>--and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khrushchev</ENAMEX> too for
that matter--those es in their names pose a problem of
phonetic correspondence.  Though usually written in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> like any other e , just as in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, they are
pronounced like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">os</ENAMEX> .  Sometimes in textbooks for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
and beginners such <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">es</ENAMEX> are marked in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> with
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> dots over them; they are sometimes transliterated
into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as os , so that occasionally you will see the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spelling Gorbachov</ENAMEX> , which in my opinion is preferable.
Then another variant in transliteration is
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-ov/-off, -ev/-eff .</ENAMEX>  The name ending in double f for
what in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> is invariably v is seldom seen nowadays;
but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few decades ago</TIMEX> or in documents or books
written then you might have seen the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>'
names transliterated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorbacheff</ENAMEX> or Gorbachoff
            
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lite/Light</ENAMEX>



            For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately a thousand years</TIMEX>, the word
light has been used to describe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> and wine
containing less <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> than regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>:

(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX>)
            

            Currently, however, many a denizen of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> regards light (also spelled lite ) as a label that
indicates that a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> is lower in calories than its nonlight
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>.

            and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khrushcheff</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khrushchoff</ENAMEX> .  I have seen both the
-ov and - off transliterations on the same page of a
book.  The reason for this variation is that when the
Cyrillic letter that represents our <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> v -sound is
final in a word, as in the nominative case for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> , it is unvoiced and sounds like f (or ff for
good measure); when an inflectional ending is added,
as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gorbacheva</ENAMEX> (the genitive case), that same letter
is voiced, like v .

            Such variations in transliteration are practically
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">endless</TIMEX>, and hardly any variation can be called an
error, though consistency is obviously desirable.  The
most troublesome inconsistencies in transliteration
seem to be owing either to the human tendency to
conceal doubt behind abundance or to multiple naturalizations
as the name migrates across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.  For
instance, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX>
is usually spelled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tchaikovsky</ENAMEX> and sometimes as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tschaikovsky</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tschaikowsky</ENAMEX> where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> letters are used to represent a sound represented
by a single <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> letter and more normally by
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, ch .  The name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaliapin</ENAMEX> was first
transliterated into a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> spelling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chaliapine</ENAMEX> ; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>,
when most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> moved to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>,
the e was dropped to Anglicize the spelling.  This was a
confusing half measure, however; the initial ch remained
as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> spelling, representing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
letter borrowed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hebrew</ENAMEX> alphabet for the
sound represented in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> by sh .  As a result, many
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> innocently mispronounce the name of the
great operatic bass and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX>.  A certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tennessean</ENAMEX>,
who became a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Chaliapin</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> cover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>, got off on the wrong foot
when he heard the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>'s name as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charley Apin</ENAMEX> .
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris</ENAMEX> was too polite to correct the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tennessean</ENAMEX>,
and others who knew better found the mistake too
amusing to rectify, that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> called
Boris good ol' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charley Apin</ENAMEX> as long as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> lived.

            The roots of the `reduced calorie' meaning of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lite/</ENAMEX>light go back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX>.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX> Meister Brau
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc. of Chicago</ENAMEX> initially marketed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meister Brau Lite</ENAMEX>, a
reduced-calorie <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> were targeted as the primary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>; but the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>, which was promoted as
a diet drink, was not very successful.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillip</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris, Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller Brewing Co.</ENAMEX> acquired the Lite
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">beer</ENAMEX> label in a buyout of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meister Brau Inc. Miller Lite</ENAMEX>
was introduced to test markets in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>; and the first
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lite</ENAMEX> commercial, which featured <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Super Bowl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Snell</ENAMEX>, aired in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July of that year</TIMEX>.  The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX> Lite
commercial, which featured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linebacker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Butkus</ENAMEX>,
was shot in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1975</TIMEX> just as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller Lite</ENAMEX> was going
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller Lite</ENAMEX> commercials were designed to convince
young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> that it is all right to drink light beer.
Consequently, these commercials, which, according to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Video Storyboard Tests Inc.</ENAMEX>, are among the most popular
ever to be shown on television, have featured former
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">athletes</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bubba Smith</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Uecker</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grier</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mickey Spillane</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drummer Buddy Rich</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comedian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodney Dangerfield</ENAMEX>).
The original theme of these commercials was:
‚ÄúEverything you always wanted in a light--and less.‚Äù

            During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early years</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> was convincing
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> that tough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> do drink light beer, other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">breweries</ENAMEX> remained skeptical.  Because they thought
light <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> had a wimpy image, they stayed out of the
light beer market for a while.  When other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">breweries</ENAMEX>
finally did enter the market, most of them used the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">spelling l-i-g-h-t: Bud Light</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Coors Light</ENAMEX>, Michelob
Light, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural Light</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Milwaukee Light</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stroh</ENAMEX>
Light .  The reason for this was simple enough: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brewing Co.</ENAMEX> owned the trademark <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lite</ENAMEX> , which it had
purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meister Brau Inc.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>.  However,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brewer Paul Kalmanovitz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falstaff Brewing</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omaha</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Brewing Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, challenged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX>'s exclusive right to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lite</ENAMEX> .  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1982</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">District Court</ENAMEX> jury in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco</ENAMEX> ruled that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lite</ENAMEX> was just an alternate spelling
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Light</ENAMEX> .  As a result of this decision, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lite</ENAMEX> may now be
used on the label of any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> to indicate that it is a
reduced-calorie <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>.

            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 20</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>) light <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beers</ENAMEX> represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 22 percent</NUMEX> of
the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$13 billion</NUMEX> beer market.  The popularity of reduced-calorie
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beers</ENAMEX> has resulted in the inclusion of the following
definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lite</ENAMEX>/light in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Unabridged</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Edition : ‚Äú13</ENAMEX>. (of alcoholic beverages)... (esp. of beer
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>) having fewer calories and usually a lower
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> content than the standard product.‚Äù

            Not all light <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beers</ENAMEX> are created equal, however.
Some have fewer calories than others: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Michelob Light</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">134 calories per 12-ounce</NUMEX> serving; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stroh Light</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Budweiser Light</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">108</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller Lite</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pabst Extra</ENAMEX>
Light, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearl Lite</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX>.  As we can see, Michelob
Light has almost twice as many calories as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearl Lite</ENAMEX>.
In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelob Light</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> calorie more (i.e.,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">134</NUMEX>) than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Heidelberg</ENAMEX> regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">133 calories</ENAMEX>).

            Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Firearms</ENAMEX> has been involved in rule-making regarding
the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lite</ENAMEX>/light as a label for alcoholic beverages.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Ficaretta</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BATF</ENAMEX> has stated that, according
to the current ruling, if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lite</ENAMEX>/light in the sense `reduced
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calorie'</ENAMEX> is applied to a malt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverage</ENAMEX>, the label on that
product must contain a statement of average analysis
with regard to calories, carbohydrates, fat and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lite</ENAMEX>/light simply describes a characteristic of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> (e.g., taste, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, color), no such statement is
required.  The last word on this matter has not been
written, however.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A decade</TIMEX> after it first became involved
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lite</ENAMEX>/light issue, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BATF</ENAMEX> , with several

            proposals on hand, is still working on rule-making
with regard to the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lite</ENAMEX>/light as a label for malt
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beverages</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>, and spirits.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barons</ENAMEX> of beerdom are not the only merchants
to have produced reduced-calorie ingestibles.  A
plethora of reduced-calorie <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> are also available for
the weight-conscious among us.  Where food products
are concerned, however, no one has ever held the exclusive
right to lite .  Therefore, both lite and light have
been freely used in the names of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX>: e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prince</ENAMEX>
Light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaghetti</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Aunt Jemima Lite Syrup, Thank You</ENAMEX>
Light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pie Filling</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitman</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lite Chocolates, Wonder</ENAMEX>
Light <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buns</ENAMEX> , and even <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Alpo Lite Dog Food</ENAMEX> .  Such products
often have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one third</NUMEX> fewer calories than their nonlight
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>, although that proportion might
vary.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Health-conscious Americans</ENAMEX> are concerned not
only with calories.  They also want less caffeine in their
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, less <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pickles</ENAMEX>, less sodium in their
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">salt</ENAMEX>, no sugar added to their canned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX>, and less tar
in their cigarettes.  Consequently, those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> who
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pander</ENAMEX> to and even help create our wants and needs
have provided us with, to name but a few, the following
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lite/</ENAMEX>light <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manor House Lite Coffee</ENAMEX> with
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one third</NUMEX> less caffeine than regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piper</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farms Lite Kosher Dills</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> less <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> than
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piper</ENAMEX>'s Farm regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dill pickles</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morton Lite Salt</ENAMEX> with
half the sodium of regular table <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Libby</ENAMEX>'s Lite
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Pears</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peaches, Mixed Fruits</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fruit Cocktail</ENAMEX> , all
of which have no sugar added<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">; Pall Mall Light 100</ENAMEX>'s
with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one third</NUMEX> less <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tar</ENAMEX> than ‚Äúthe leading filter king-sized
cigarette.‚Äù

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory Weismantel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foods</ENAMEX>, has stated: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äú Lite</ENAMEX> is perceived by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> as a
name of a product that has less of a negative ingredient‚Äù
( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Tribune</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 4, 1981</TIMEX>).  His statement
foreshadowed a new definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lite</ENAMEX>/light that
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX> later appeared in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX> II : <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äú12</NUMEX>. low
in any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>, starch, or tars, that is considered
harmful or undesirable: light cigarettes .‚Äù

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lite/Light</ENAMEX> , when applied to a food, may refer to
the product's taste, color, or texture rather than to the
number of calories or the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>, or
cholesterol it contains.  For example, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>, Frito-Lay
introduced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Light Corn Chips</ENAMEX> , which were thinner
and crispier than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frito-Lay</ENAMEX>'s regular corn <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chips</ENAMEX> but
which had just as much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> and a few more calories
than the regular product.  In order to avoid confusion,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frito-Lay</ENAMEX> subsequently changed the name to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crisp 'N</ENAMEX>
Thin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corn Chips</ENAMEX> .  Not all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> of food products
are as concerned about customer confusion, however.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Cooper</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tenn.</ENAMEX>) has observed: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äú[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>] strain the limits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language
and our patience by overusing words such as...
light .  The more we distort the language, the less the
consumer can understand the product‚Äù ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago SunTimes</ENAMEX> ,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 19, 1986</TIMEX>).

            In an effort to shed some light on the use of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lite/</ENAMEX>light , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cooper</ENAMEX> introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1986</TIMEX> a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bill</ENAMEX> that would have limited the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lite</ENAMEX>/light to
products that have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one third</NUMEX> fewer calories, one half
less <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> fourths less sodium than regular (i.e.,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonlight</ENAMEX>) products.  This bill was lost in the legislative
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shuffle</ENAMEX>, however, and, as of this writing (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 25</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>), has yet to be passed in spite of having been
reintroduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987 and 1988</TIMEX>.  The bill, which, in its
current form, would require a product labeled
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lite/</ENAMEX>light to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one third</NUMEX> fewer calories, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one third</NUMEX> less
fat, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one third</NUMEX> less sodium than regular, nonlight
products, will have to be introduced once again in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>.  Perhaps the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> time will be a charm.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Potables</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">comestibles</ENAMEX>, and smokables are not the
only products to bear the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lite</ENAMEX>/light designation.  In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hallmark</ENAMEX> introduced a series of greeting cards
that contained puns.  They were called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LITE</ENAMEX> and were
described as being ‚Äúa <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> less serious than regular
greeting cards.‚Äù  This description was, of course, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allusion</ENAMEX> to the solecism that has been used to promote
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller Lite</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúLite has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> less calories than their
regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Wax</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> introduced
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Glade Light</ENAMEX> , an aerosol air freshener with less
than half the perfume of regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sprays</ENAMEX>.  In the same
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jhirmack</ENAMEX> introduced <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lite Shampoo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lite Conditioner</ENAMEX> ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lite Mousse</ENAMEX> , which are designed to clean,
condition, and style one's hair without build-up.

            The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lite</ENAMEX>/light has extended beyond product
names.  In such cases, the term may be used in a
descriptive sense to indicate that something is less intense
than its nonlight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX>.  Often, however,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lite/</ENAMEX>light is used humorously, or even caustically.

            Low-impact aerobics have been called lite aerobics .
In music, there are <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lite Rock</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lite FM</ENAMEX> .  Book
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kisor</ENAMEX> used the term <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lite Mystery</ENAMEX> to refer
to a book ‚Äúwith <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only half</NUMEX> the calories of a regular
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">whodunit‚Äù</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Sun-Times</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 24, 1987</TIMEX>).  Regarding
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Lampoon</ENAMEX> parody of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> ,

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lite College</ENAMEX> is what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Mieses</ENAMEX> proffered the

            In the political arena, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Hart</ENAMEX>, who tried so

previously had been ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 16, 1987</TIMEX>).

            A metaphor for our time.  That, according to some

            Crime <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>
            This is a revision of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX> dictionary reviewed
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Autumn 1985</TIMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XII,2</NUMEX>] issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>.  The
price has increased from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10.95 to $24.95</NUMEX> and it would
appear that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> pages have been added.  I commented
then that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mata Hari</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy Bean</ENAMEX> were both in
but that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doc Holliday</ENAMEX> was missing: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holliday</ENAMEX> is still on
vacation and now the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bean</ENAMEX> has joined him.  I commented
then that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> vache `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX>' had been omitted
from the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">supplement</ENAMEX>: it is still missing.  The
entry for big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> tomato , on which I had commented,
is no longer there, though big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX>' is there.

            It is difficult to compare the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> editions.  Though
the dust-jacket blurb promises that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> new terms
were added, it is not easy to see where, and if, in order
to fit them in, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of</NUMEX> entries were deleted, that
diminishes the value of the book.  There is no reason to
assume that a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX> book of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">231</NUMEX> pp. selling for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10.95</NUMEX>
should yield a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> book of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">550pp</TIMEX>. at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$24.95</NUMEX>, but one
might have expected more: in light of the information
that inflation over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past six years</TIMEX> has averaged <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about</TIMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX>, one might expect the same book to cost as much
as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$13.95</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, even allowing for a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7%</NUMEX> increase in
its length (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> pages).  For <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$24.95</NUMEX> we ought to have the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> new entries and the old ones besides (revised, as
necessary).  If you have the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX> edition, I see no justification
for buying the new <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> merely to line the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>'s pockets.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Urdang</ENAMEX>
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Gambling & Gaming</ENAMEX>

            The language of gambling and gaming might be
classified as a blend of slang and jargon: the former
seems almost obvious; the latter cannot be denied because
there are so many technical terms involved.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> of English and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linguistics</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>--where else?), former
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Dialect Society</ENAMEX>, erstwhile
field <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARE</ENAMEX> and contributor to many
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journals</ENAMEX> (including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>, mentioned on p. xiii but
ignored by whoever wrote the dust-jacket blurb, presumably
because it was not deemed to be among the
‚Äúimportant‚Äù ones), has spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> compiling
this dictionary.  The book is done ‚Äúon historical principles‚Äù--that
is, it relies for its defining and other evidence
on citations drawn from a great many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>--and it is all the more interesting for that.

            The ordinary entry is structured to show the headword
or phrase, in boldface, followed by an italicized
part-of-speech label, followed by the definition, then
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.  The really good stuff shows up,
though, when citations are given, for many of them
are lively:



<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúA‚Äù</ENAMEX> card, n. A certificate issued by a law-enforcement
agency indicating security clearance
for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>.  See also <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CARD and SHERIFF</ENAMEX>'S
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CARD</ENAMEX>.

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taylor Las Vegas</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>.  No inside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> can work
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strip</ENAMEX> without the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äú50‚</NUMEX>Äù card, or
downtown without the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s ‚ÄúA‚Äù card, signifying
clearance.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">1983 Clark Oral Coll</ENAMEX>.  We used to call a work permit
an A card, but since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro</ENAMEX> was formed [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Las</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vegas Metropolitan Police</ENAMEX>, combining <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">county</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>], we just call it and the fifty card a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sheriff</ENAMEX>'s card.

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hand on the dice, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n. phr</ENAMEX>.  In bank craps, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">command</ENAMEX> from the stickman or boxman to a player
to pick up and throw the dice with a
single hand.  Compare NO <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DICE</ENAMEX> and NO ROLL.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Martinet Oral Coll</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> doesn't want
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shooter</ENAMEX> to use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hands in handling the dice.
It's too easy to pull a switch.  If somebody uses
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hands, like cupping the hands and blowing
on the dice, the stick or somebody will yell,
‚Äúone hand on the dice, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shooter</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  If there's
anything suspicious about the move, the stick
will kill the dice [stop the dice while they are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rolling</ENAMEX>] and shove them to the boxman.  He has
to say ‚Äúno roll‚Äù quickly so there won't be a
beef.

<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> dealing, n.  The act of dealing a card
other than the top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">card</ENAMEX> on a pack.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">1891 Hoffman Baccarat</ENAMEX>.  There is, however, an
expedient familiar to conjurers as ‚Äúchanging a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">card</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which, with a little modification, is
extensively used by the cardsharping fraternity
under the name of ‚Äúsecond dealing.‚Äù  The result
of the sleight is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX>, while apparently
giving the top card in the usual way, actually
gives the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> card instead of it.
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> relies to some extent on oral collections, his own
and that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas A. Martinet</ENAMEX>, which have been
built up over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>.  One is tempted to envision
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark, ‚Äúwired</ENAMEX>,‚Äù hanging about in gambling dens; but
anyone familiar with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> around the world
knows that those glittery <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> could scarcely be so
characterized.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Damon Runyon</ENAMEX>'s ghost (or the ghosts of
some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> who ‚Äúworked‚Äù his novels) will
not be in evidence here.

            According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>, a chute is the name
for the slot (over the drop box ) through which the
dealer pushes the money paid for chips at a gaming
table.  According to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte Carlo</ENAMEX> folklore, it was a
slide, accessible only through a trap-door, that emptied
out into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> far below: the bodies
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gamblers</ENAMEX> who had taken their own lives after losing
the family fortunes were dispatched through the chute
into oblivion.  What happens to bodies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlantic City</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>, and other gambling hells is not revealed in
this book, but one can be sure that those who run the
establishments do not take kindly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">losers</ENAMEX> who ask for
their money back, explaining that they did not know
that they were playing ‚Äúfor keeps.‚Äù

            There have been other dictionaries on the subject:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> lists the important ones as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Sources</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of</TIMEX>
this volume.  But this work is probably the best of them
all.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Gambling & Gaming</ENAMEX> is not a
gamble, and anyone putting down his <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$48</NUMEX> will be betting
on a sure thing.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bloomsbury Good Word Guide</ENAMEX>

            Some very talented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have brought their
knowledge to bear on everyday questions and
problems of language in this book: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Manser</ENAMEX>,
whose <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Penguin Wordmaster Dictionary</ENAMEX> was favorably
reviewed here [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>]; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty Kirkpatrick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary ; Jonathon</ENAMEX>
Green, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">compiler</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thesaurus of Slang</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Newspeak</ENAMEX> ,
and a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Jargon</ENAMEX> (soon to be reviewed here);
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Silverlight</ENAMEX>, who writes a language column in
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Observer</ENAMEX> , which I have not seen.  From such a
formidable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, one should expect a good Good
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Word Guide</ENAMEX> .

            This book suffers from the essential problem
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> with all other books of reference: however
sound the advice they give, it is useless and meaningless
if it is not looked up.  That might seem too much of
a truism even for me to express, but let me explain.
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> feel that educational systems everywhere
have deteriorated to an unconscionably low level and
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> are no longer taught (in particular) English
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grammar</ENAMEX> and usage the way they once were.  In
the ‚Äúgood <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">old days</TIMEX>,‚Äù when the system was presumably
better, many books on usage were also published, so
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> must conclude that although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> then might
have been ‚Äúexposed‚Äù to grammar and usage, they did
not learn it.  Yet, one does have the (possibly romantic)
impression that even though grammar and usage were
not properly learned, at least enough of a subliminal
impression of them was retained by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to lead
them to doubt a construction when they encountered
it, driving them to check it in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fowler</ENAMEX> or some other
work.  What I am getting at is that more and more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> today seem to be less and less aware of any but
their own way of using the language, either because
they are no longer exposed to the writings of great
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>, or because they are not taught grammar and
usage and style, or both.  The only way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> can be
taught to improve their use of any language is by compelling
them to use it, chiefly by requiring of them on
a regular basis, preferably not less often than once a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>, a piece of writing which is gone over carefully
for usage and grammar to ensure a compatibility with
a standard to be devoutly wished for if not achieved.
After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> or more of such exercise, even if the
individual cannot recall the difference between imply
and infer , at least it is likely that whenever a choice is
encountered a small bell will ring somewhere in the
recesses of his mind, recalling a long-forgotten paper
for which the grade might have been reduced because
of a failure to know the difference.  If this were a Rube
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg contraption</ENAMEX>, this recollection would remind
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> of the grease spot on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, caused by his
having eaten a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Mac</ENAMEX>, the memory of which conjures
up such a vivid image that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> opens his
mouth to take a bite, and a string attached to his lower
jaw releases a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, the sight of which arouses a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
which chases it, causing the mouse to squeal, awakening
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">midget</ENAMEX> who stretches, tripping open a trapdoor;
through the trapdoor falls a usage book, sliding down
a chute into the hands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>.

            Would that life were so simple!

            There appears to be nothing remaining to prompt
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to use usage books--indeed, reference books of
any kind.  In a time when professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> write
things like, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúNeither Lord King</ENAMEX> nor Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colin Marshall</ENAMEX>
... were available for comment...‚Äù (and worse),
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> cannot accuse them of having made an error of
judgment because that implies an awareness of choice;
in order to have a choice, one must know of alternatives,
and I am ineluctably drawn to the conclusion
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> write the way they do because they know
of no alternative.

            Those who publish usage books seem to believe
that sometime, somewhere, there will be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who,
when they use neither , will immediately rush to their
Good Word <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide</ENAMEX> to find out whether it takes a singular
or a plural verb.  That, as we all know, is a forlorn
hope (to abuse a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Dutch clich√©</NUMEX>): those who ‚Äúknow‚Äù that
when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or more</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> or things are the subject of a
verb you have to use were , not was , regardless of the
context, are like those who ‚Äúknow‚Äù (like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Arden</ENAMEX>) that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">millennium</TIMEX> is spelled with one
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>, who ‚Äúknow‚Äù that it is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parmagiana</ENAMEX> , not Parmigiana
(like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burger King</ENAMEX>), and who have no
doubt that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">baking soda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">baking powder</ENAMEX>, washing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice-cream soda</ENAMEX> are all the same thing.  The cause
would appear to be lost when one takes note that the
only pronunciation recorded in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> dictionaries for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">machismo</ENAMEX> is ‚Äúmakizmo,‚Äù as if it were derived from
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>: even a spelling pronunciation would have been
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preferable</ENAMEX>.

            Given the nature of the publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>,
it is probably not at all surprising to see another usage
book (bearing in mind that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fowler</ENAMEX> is being updated
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Burchfield</ENAMEX>), though, if you believe all
the foregoing palaver, no one will ever refer to it.  All
that having been said, it must be acknowledged that as
long as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> buy books, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> do not really
much care whether they are read, used as doorstops,
or for propping up a sagging curio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX>.

            Turning to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Introduction</ENAMEX>, written by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kirkpatrick</ENAMEX>, we read, ‚ÄúThere is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of thought
prevalent mainly among older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> which seeks to
impose a kind of restriction on language that is not
imposed on other areas of life.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>  [p. v] I guess that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúolder‚Äù</ENAMEX> means `anyone older than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kirkpatrick</ENAMEX>,' which I
happen to be; but, while it is a matter of fact (and of
record) that I do seek to impose restrictions, they are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> against inept, ineffectual, inaccurate language
and poor style.  Moreover, who says I don't seek
to impose restrictions on other areas of life?  I despise
bad art, hypocrisy and other forms of dishonesty and,
in general, execrate any policy or behavior that interferes
with the rights and freedoms of others.

            Having relegated conservatism and old fogeyism
to one another, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kirkpatrick</ENAMEX> asks [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p. vi</ENAMEX>], ‚ÄúShould we say
it wasn't I or it wasn't me ; between you and me or
between you and I; different from, different to , or
different than; less bottles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">fewer</NUMEX> bottles of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk ?‚Äù</ENAMEX>  (In my own recommended usage, when it
comes to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>, it makes no difference; but if you are
talking about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gin</ENAMEX>, then neither is acceptable.)
What does that word should mean?  Smacks of old
fogeyism, does it not?

            Further down page vi: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúWhere a supposed alternatives
is in fact wrong this is clearly stated.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Wrong</ENAMEX> ?
Who is the old fogey now, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kirkpatrick</ENAMEX>?  Again and
again we read <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about ‚</NUMEX>Äúthe careful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>, who wishes to
use English correctly and congently‚Äù in contrast to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúthe
run-of-the-mill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>, who frequently sacrifices care and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correctness</ENAMEX> in the interests of speed.‚Äù  To impute such
sacrifices to a desire for speed is not only a misinterpretation
of the evidence but a curious thing to say, for
those who are in a hurry are scarcely likely to stop
everything, pick up this (or any other book) to check
something, and then resume their headlong plunge
into the solecistic abyss.  Are not the ‚Äúrun-of-the-mill
users‚Äù really just ‚Äúthe careless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, who [as they
would probably say] could care less about using English
correctly and cogently‚Äù?

            The most attractive thing about this book is the
writing, which, for the most part, is simple, clear,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">straightforward</ENAMEX>, and readable.  In short, the book is
‚Äúuser-friendly.‚Äù  It is essentially a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> work for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> market (or for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who want to use English
the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> do).  The entries cover spelling,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pronunciation</ENAMEX>, grammar, punctuation, usage, buzz
words, and subsets of all of those.  The advice is direct
(if old-fogeyish):



Alternative should not be used in place of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternate</ENAMEX>.
[<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Deceptively</ENAMEX>] is frequently misused....

[<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">espite</ENAMEX> of is incorrect, and it is never necessary
to precede either despite or in spite of with but.
To avoid mistakes, remember the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hangar</ENAMEX>.
            

            ...And so on.  In other words, one gets the impression
that the convervatism criticized on page v was
promptly forgotton on page vi.  Inevitably, I have some
suggestions and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criticisms</ENAMEX> to offer:

            It would have been useful, when discussing the
spelling of gynaecology , to have added a word on its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pronunciation</ENAMEX>.

            A note on custom (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brit</ENAMEX>.) versus business (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>)
might prove helpful.

            At the entry for bi -, the definition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bicentennial</TIMEX>
as `every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two hundred years</TIMEX>' omits mention of its more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">commonly</ENAMEX> encountered use as a noun (along with bi-centenary )
meaning `<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundredth</NUMEX> anniversary.‚Äù

            A note on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> would have been useful to criticize
the usage <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">‚ÄúFirst Annual Competition</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            There are some typographical errors, as in the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> pronunciation of dinghy , where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">roman ‚Äúi‚</ENAMEX>Äù
should have been in italics.  The bad hyphenations,
apparently performed by a (feeble-minded, misprogrammed)

embarrassing--if these sorts of things can still embarrass
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publishers</ENAMEX> -- is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúspel-ling,‚</ENAMEX>Äù which occurs at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americanism</ENAMEX>
and again at your or you're ?, from which it is
picked up for reproduction on page xi of the front
matter.

            The writing falters in the entries for imply or infer ?
and centre on or centre around ?

            A funny thing or two happened in the pronunciation
key: the distinction is made between r as the symbol
for the initial sound in rim and rr for the medial
sound in marry .  Although these are different sounds in
many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British English</ENAMEX> dialects, they are not only allophonic
but in complementary distribution (that is,
they never exchange places), hence do not need separate
symbols.  Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> have avoided the schwa
\?\, preferring to resurrect the antediluvian system
used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merriam-Webster</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Edition of</ENAMEX>
their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unabridged</ENAMEX> (and since abandoned by almost
everyone).  Even in the ‚Äúah-OO-gah,‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äúmoo-goo-gaipan‚</NUMEX>Äù
school of pronunciation, the unstressed vowel is
rendered by a uniform <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>, usually ‚Äúuh.‚Äù

            At and/or we read, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚Äú cotton</ENAMEX> and/or nylon socks , for
example, means `cotton socks, nylon socks, and socks
made from a mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cotton</ENAMEX> and nylon.' ‚Äù To me, it
means, `cotton socks, or nylon socks, or both': there is
nothing inherent in the example even hinting at the
existence of socks made of a nylon and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton mixture</ENAMEX>.

            In the matter of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Celsius</ENAMEX> versus centigrade , the
point is not that they are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúidentical‚Äù</ENAMEX> (which is ambiguous
for `very similar' and `the same thing'), but that
they are the same thing: the scale formerly called centigrade
was renamed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX> to honor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anders Celsius</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">astronomer</ENAMEX> who devised it.

            Information on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> usage is treated inconsistently
and, as the book is for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>, might
well have been eliminated altogether.

            There is no entry for free gift , just as obnoxious in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> as anywhere else <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is used.

            An entry on this or that ?  would have been in order,
chiefly to cover its usage as a pronoun or pronominal
adjective of reference.

            In the entry for former or latter ?  the advice is
given to write, ‚Äú The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killer</ENAMEX> left...in a stolen <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>; this
[not the latter ] was later found... .‚Äù  I do not consider
that good writing.

            As for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word forte `strength,' it is not
the feminine form of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> adjective fort `strong'
but an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English ‚Äúfeminization‚Äù</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> noun fort
`strength.'  The pronunciation ‚Äúfor-tay‚Äù is an illiteracy,
scarcely attributable (as given here and in various dictionaries)
to a confusion with the musical direction so
pronounced because that is a loanword from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>:
those who know about musical directions are not likely
to blunder that badly.

            If enough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> buy this book, it will soon need
a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> printing which, it is hoped, will include some
of the foregoing (not these ) recommendations.

            According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EFL Gazette</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1988</TIMEX>], a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Birmingham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, was outraged that a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pakistani</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23 years</TIMEX>, had the
effrontery to be so ignorant of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as to need an
interpreter in court; he sentenced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">culprit</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>' probation with the condition that he learn the
language.
         
         
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the worst decAIDS in memory, the theme song
of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">'80s</NUMEX> ought to be

            Bardoubling



            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Imogen</ENAMEX> rhapsodizes on the immensity of
her love for her banished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> she insists it is beyond
beyond .  For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> I have been captivated
by that phrase, created by the doubling of a fairly
ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preposition</ENAMEX>/noun, now magically employed
in just that relationship.  This expression of infinity
produces a stunning effect, one not likely with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> discrete words.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> has coined an expansive
image out of the minimum arrangement of
this simple word.  And beyond beyond describes the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">poet</ENAMEX> himself, in his surpassing power of imagination
and his unparalleled gift for language.

            Thus inspired, I dreamed up a new word game.
For the moment, call it ‚ÄúDoubling.‚Äù  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> who
has devised a `double' provides to the others a definition,
whereupon they try to respond with the precise
double.  Example: what has the cobbler when only one
shoe form remains?  Obvious answer, his last last .  Or,
last exam?  Why, final final , of course.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">verb/noun</ENAMEX>
entry: to tough out a storm, that is, to weather
weather .  More doubles, minus definitions, are: cozy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cozy</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> march, short short, fair fair , and so on.

            Our rules for playing are: capitalized words or
proper names are allowed, but redundant entries are
not; slick slick does not qualify.  Nor do hyphenated
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phrases</ENAMEX>, such as go-go, no-no , which are merely intensification.
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words must be identical in spelling,
but not in capitalization.  However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> might well
make their own rules.

            This game was invented as `More matter for a May
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>' when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and I drove <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> from
West Texas to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX>, a goodly distance,
be assured.  The scenery was not always breathtaking,
so a new word game (verbal, no paraphernalia) was
needed to keep us awake.  To honor the source of its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inspiration</ENAMEX>, should we perhaps entitle it ‚ÄúBardling,‚Äù or
how about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúBardoubling‚Äù</ENAMEX>?  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert D. Anson</ENAMEX>

         
         
            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Times</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 May 1988</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tandy</ENAMEX> immigrated to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gyomaendrod</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1938</TIMEX> to work as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servant</ENAMEX>.  Within a short
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> had been sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, costing her
the position, and she learned of the death of her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>.  The shock was severe enough to strike her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dumb</ENAMEX>, and she was committed to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>.
When she recovered her power of speech, her English
was so bad that she could not make herself understood,
and she languished in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 40</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>--till recently, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> began to make
arrangements to close and move her elsewhere.  An
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interpreter</ENAMEX> was called in, investigated her background
and story, and discovered that some of her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> still
lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>.  Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tandy</ENAMEX>, now <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">78</TIMEX>, will rejoin her
family to live out her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.

            The definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">schmeer</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>] in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> New International <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX> is wrong--or at
least incomplete.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schmeer</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> verb meaning
`to apply an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ointment</ENAMEX> or lubricant' and is commonly
used as a slang term for `bribe,' no doubt because a
bribe is seen as lubricating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wheels</ENAMEX> of bureaucracy.
I cannot imagine how it has come to mean the `entire
deal, whole package.'



         
         

            Certainly VERBATIM is one of the most literate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications</ENAMEX> in the English-speaking world <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.  Because
of that, I was surprised (and a little shocked) to
find the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Tom's Cabin</ENAMEX> referred to as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúMiss‚Äù Stowe in Robert M. Sebastian</ENAMEX>'s amusing article,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúRed Pants</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  Surely every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> literature
knows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harriet Beecher Stowe</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">famous clergyman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Ward Beecher</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calvin Stowe</ENAMEX>, another eminent divine.




         
         
            [ Similarly from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Col.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert O. Rupp</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Springs</ENAMEX>.]
            
         
         

            I am surprised that to my knowledge, there has
been no published response to ETYMOLOGICA OBSCURA
[XIV<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX>] with regard to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">weasel</ENAMEX> .  Surely there is
someone else alive besides myself who was taught the
dance as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and was told that the weasel was part
of a stitching and weaving machine.  During part of
the dance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> did weave in and out.  In another
part, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head dancers</ENAMEX> skipped down the inside of
a double row and back outside, exchanging places
with the next in line, thus ‚Äúpopping the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">weasel</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            The following words would seem to indicate that
the weasel was a part of a sewing machine:



A <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">penny</NUMEX> for a spool of thread,

A <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">penny</NUMEX> for a needle.

That's the way the money goes--

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúPop!‚Äù</ENAMEX> goes the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">weasel</ENAMEX>.

Up and down the village <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>,

Up and down the teasle... etc.
            

            The teasle is also part of a stitching machine.  I don't
recall the ‚Äúmonkey‚Äù part of the verse, but this could be
the mechanism which ‚Äúpopped‚Äù the weasel by checking
the stitching and reversing the machine to start a
new row.  Frequently, the thread broke at this time and
the machine had to be rethreaded.




         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Favorite Grammatical Games: Legerdemain in Two Senses and False Scents</ENAMEX>




            In front of a cozy fire on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>'s night in the
library of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Cheever</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">country houses</ENAMEX>, on
the beach at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waikiki</ENAMEX>, even on a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>
commuter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>, finding <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Legerdemain in Two Senses</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">False Scents</ENAMEX> can be fun and games for all, and all
you need is (usually) some printed matter or even just
an inventive mind.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fowler</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern English Usage</ENAMEX> one of the more
intriguing entries is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Legerdemain in Two Senses</ENAMEX> .
Under that heading he points out the sneaky way in
which one word is often <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-faced in the sense that its
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> meaning gets switched when it is used the second
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> in a sentence.  For example, here is one that I have
slightly titivated:



<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX> had now got his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> taste of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and it
was a taste that was to show many developments.
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fowler</ENAMEX> points out that the taste <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX> got <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> was an
`experience'; the taste that showed developments was
an `inclination.'  (It was a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> taste of print that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mark</ENAMEX>
gets in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fowler</ENAMEX>, if you are wondering about that titivation.)
The technical name for the device is polyptoton .

            In other words, what happens is something like
the legerdemain of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magician</ENAMEX>'s now-you-see-it-now-you-don't.
Did you catch my alls in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> paragraph,
by the way?  Let's look as a few other choice
specimens I have bagged:



It is dangerous to mess around with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ouija</ENAMEX> boards
... and it is dangerous to condone them.
            

            The first dangerous means `harmful,' while the second
means `irresponsible.'



Pretty girls finish <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, which is pretty unfair to
others.

The pretty pousse caf√© is pretty hard to pour.
            

            In the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> examples an adjective switches to an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adverb</ENAMEX>.  An ultimate epitome of the case: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúShe</ENAMEX>'s pretty
pretty.‚Äù



<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Sixty-five</NUMEX> is just as safe as fifty-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>, so it's safe to
allow the faster speed.
            

            Or to give equal time, as it were:



<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> is safer than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">65 mph</NUMEX>, so it is safer to keep the
limit at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>.
            

            There is a nice touch of political legerdemain here,
you'll note, when the first safe(r) changes before our
very eyes from having a physical connotation to a
socio-political one.

            There is a lovely example in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fowler</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> ,
which shows how slack political phraseology
can turn out to be (we just dropped a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">False Scent</ENAMEX> --no
comma between the qualifiers of phraseology -- see below)
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">black beast</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any era</TIMEX>; obviously the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beast</ENAMEX> was
rampaging even in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fowler</ENAMEX>'s golden <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>.  We'll bring
things <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to date</TIMEX> by presenting his example in modern
dress:



Many <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-world <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> are virtually subject to
our <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, but such
government has generally been held back by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
from taking any decisive action.
            

            Sounds fair enough, surely?  Ah, but you see there is a
subtle quick-change there, and, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>, we should
wonder whether it was intentional or just imprecise
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grammar</ENAMEX>.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> government really means `governance'
while the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> means `governing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>.'  True,
there is an acceptable synonymity here but it is not to
be used in the same sentence.
And how about:



We must indeed all hang together, or... we shall
all hang separately.
            

            Such sloppiness can indeed become rich fare for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>.

            Now we come to those delightful <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">False Scents</ENAMEX> .

            They are sly.  By all means read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fowler</ENAMEX>'s delightful
statement of affairs about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">False Scents</ENAMEX> --he generates a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wonderfully</ENAMEX>, though quite unwitting, humorous cameo
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> virtually calling each other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fools</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> wins because he is right--it is up to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> to ensure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> should not be given
any <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">False Scents</ENAMEX> .  Here are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional ones to the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> examples <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fowler</ENAMEX> gives that cause a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> to go
down the wrong track in a sentence, ending in a sort of
double-take:



<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur</ENAMEX> found, after taking a wrong turning and
going right past the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, and having looked for it
carefully <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day before</TIMEX>, that he had left his pen
and briefcase at home.
            

            And we all thought he was going to find his dream
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX>--or perhaps a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">million-dollar baby</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-and-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-cent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">store</ENAMEX>.  Or as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fowler</ENAMEX> would (perhaps) say,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur</ENAMEX> found a noun clause instead of a good solid
common noun he could mortgage or marry.



Leaning forward, with her hand shielding the
strong sunlight from her eyes, she was looking,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur</ENAMEX> thought, particularly beautiful and poised.
            

            We are beginning to get angry with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur</ENAMEX>.  We all
thought she was looking for him at least; certainly not
for a mere predicate adjective.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brahman</ENAMEX> or brahman?



            For several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Sanskrit</ENAMEX> word brahman
(pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BRAAHMAN</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> vowel sounds as
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> ) has been used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
language.  Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade or so ago</TIMEX> it was spelt
brahmin , which is now given as an alternate spelling,
and has survived in such expressions of common occurrence
as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Brahmins</ENAMEX> .  While every literate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
may not be familiar with the expression, those
who are will know that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Brahmin</ENAMEX> refers to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aristocrats</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> such as the Cabots
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lodges</ENAMEX>.  My <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> is not with the meaning
of the expression but with the persistent capitalization
of the word.

            Derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brahma</ENAMEX> `the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Principle</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme</ENAMEX>
Being of some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> philosophical systems
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vedanta</ENAMEX>,' a brahman is primarily a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who
believes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brahma</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brahman</ENAMEX> .  By extension brahman
came to mean a `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the sacred or sacerdotal
caste,' as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> has it.  In order to avoid confusion
I shall henceforth spell the word without capitalization
to denote the `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caste</ENAMEX>' and with a capital to
imply `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the Absolute</ENAMEX>.'  This in fact is the crux of the
problem.  When we use the word Absolute with a capital
‚Äúa‚Äù we know that it has a very specific application.
It is high time that brahman be so spelt when the caste
is implied, reserving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brahman</ENAMEX> when `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the Absolute'</ENAMEX> is
meant.  This will not only help the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> to distinguish
between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> meanings but will conform to
conventional capitalization in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language.

            The error was originally made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>.  Not only were the brahmans the
best educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Hindus</ENAMEX> they met, but also, more important,
it was soon realized that among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindus</ENAMEX> the
brahman was a much more ‚Äúsacred‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> than say
the molla is among the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rabbi</ENAMEX> among the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> among the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>.  From time
immemorial the brahmans of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> had insisted upon
their social and spiritual superiority.  In many of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">common Sanskrit</ENAMEX> prayers a brahman is invoked or imprecated
along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">gods</ENAMEX>.  To do reverence to a
brahman was to do reverence to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brahman</ENAMEX>, for a brahman
was not simply the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">intermediary</ENAMEX> between man
and the gods: he was a god.

            Confronted with this attitude and somewhat
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">awed</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> acknowledged their respect by capitalizing
the word.  But what is even more curious is
that they also capitalized the expressions for the three
other castes, viz. kshatriya `martial class,' vaisya `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX>,' and sudra `menials.'  It is remarkable
that this anomaly still persists, even in many modern
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.

            The English-speaking world, expecially <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.A.</ENAMEX>, and even <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> claim to
be the bastions of democracy, which clearly should not
recognize caste or class distinctions.  Is it not ironic
then that they should still perpetuate so blatant a fallacy?
Compilers of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> should stop capitalizing
the words for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">castes</ENAMEX> and retain
the custom only for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brahma</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brahman</ENAMEX> when it implies
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Absolute</ENAMEX>.  Not only will it avoid confusion
among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of dictionaries, but it will restore the
preeminence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brahma</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brahman</ENAMEX> while reducing
the brahmans to the status of the rest of us mortals,
where they really belong.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxey Brooke</ENAMEX>'s article, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúTexican‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XV,2</NUMEX>], was an
interesting comment on a phenomenon that must fascinate
anybody who loves words.  Who would have
thought that a word like quirt , which I had always
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with hounds and stirrup cups, came from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> for `rope,' or `string,' cuerda .  The meagre
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> I have at home bear out that origin, however.

            I hope Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brooke</ENAMEX> will forgive my picking a couple
of nits.  He implies that chile and tamale are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>
words that have passed into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> usage.  They
may be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texican</ENAMEX> in that form, but in the original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>
they had to be chile and tamal ( chilis and tamales
in the plural, of course.)  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chile</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, and even
the most ignorant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> would not call <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> tamal a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tamale</ENAMEX> .

            The word transfers work in the opposite direction,
too, of course.  Witness the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Central American</ENAMEX>
use of parquear `to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>,' instead of the more
traditionally <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">estacionar</ENAMEX> .  A dancing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buenos</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aires</ENAMEX> is a rather low-class <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclub</ENAMEX>.  For wrestling, or
what is loosely called wrestling in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Cone</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX> went to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> catch-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as</NUMEX>-catchcan .
If you are familiar with the difficulty <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> have with dentals and fricatives when these
are not separated by vowels, you can understand that
the task of producing a string of sounds like that tends
to stop a conversation, if not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>.  So it was soon
shortened to catchascan , and then ultimately to catch ,
leaving the t in the written form, although it is foreign
to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orthography</ENAMEX>.  So in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buenos Aires</ENAMEX>, if you
want to inform somebody you are going to the wrestling
matches, you say ‚Äú <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Voy al</ENAMEX> catch .‚Äù

            I guess <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are a little nutty if they take a
delight in these things.




         
         

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David W. Porter</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XV,3</NUMEX>] tells us that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
‚Äúproduce such monstrosities as sutoraike for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
`strike'...‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sad</ENAMEX> to say, he is doubly wrong.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>,
the transliteration is equivalent to sutoraiku ; in
labor relations (an earlier borrowing) to sutoraiki .

            As for Gone with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windo</ENAMEX> , he errs in leaving
Gone with the untouched and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windo</ENAMEX> would correctly
be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uindo</ENAMEX> .  Others of his assertions are not amenable
to brief correction.




         
         

            Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.A. Davidson</ENAMEX> should not adopt the pronunciation
of scone to rhyme with `bone'--at any rate not
because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX>, where he lives, is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúveddy English</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
That pronunciation is a shibboleth, or rather sibboleth,
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English English</ENAMEX> in terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúU‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-U‚Äù</ENAMEX>--as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Betjeman</ENAMEX> noted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> in his cautionary
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">poem How to Get On in Society</ENAMEX> , which ends:

            (The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> line of the poem, in case anyone wants to
read more of it, is ‚ÄúPhone for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>-knives, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>)

            Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davidson misquotes Gowers</ENAMEX>, who does not say
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> pronunciation is `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skawn</ENAMEX>' (which
would rhyme with `<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX>.')  What he gives is
`sk\?\n'--with a `short sign' over the o --rhyming with
`<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">don</ENAMEX>,' which is socially correct south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Border</ENAMEX> as
well as north.




         
         

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> showed me VERBATIM [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XIV,3</NUMEX>] in which I
noted the paragraph on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> about names for subatomic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX>.  Actually, the word quark is in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> as a verb meaning `croak,' with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> references
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">frogs</ENAMEX>, rooks, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herons</ENAMEX>.  This seems more
relevant to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce</ENAMEX>'s use than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> word for
`curds.'  This was missed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tindall</ENAMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reader's</ENAMEX>
Guide to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finnegans Wake</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McHugh</ENAMEX> in his Annotations
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FW</ENAMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glasheen</ENAMEX> has it in her 3rd <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census</ENAMEX> .

            Much could be said about particle names.  SUSY
(pronounced as spelt), or supersymmetry theory, is
prolific.  Each known elementary particle is associated
with a hypothetical complementary particle (recalling,
surely unintentionally, ‚Äúsosie sesthers,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FW</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p.3</ENAMEX>):
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUSY</ENAMEX> = ?  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sosie</ENAMEX> = `twin').  Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Joycean</ENAMEX> are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slepton</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> to the leptons) and wino (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> boson) ... as well as squark .  There's lots more
in the field (or not in it), such as techniquarks,
glueballs , and ghosts (which are not really there).




         
         

            Further to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúDo Mistake</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Learn Better‚</ENAMEX>Äù [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XV,1</NUMEX>]:
During the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> conflict, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> was filled
with mangled <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> translations,
especially in correspondence between assorted
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>.  The overwhelming majority
of the confusion stemmed from the fact that the only
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúcomplete‚Äù bilingual dictionary</ENAMEX> readily available to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-volume monstrosity by a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>.  I cannot answer for his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">command</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX>; his grasp of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> was, to
put it mildly, feeble and slippery.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> was widely
known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúInside Detective Bureau‚Äù</ENAMEX>; we eventually
started to use it ourselves.  A phrase commonly used by
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> commands to describe what they were doing
to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Vietnam</ENAMEX> was ‚Äúfoil up their dark schemes.‚Äù

            I had a Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ban</ENAMEX> assigned to me as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX>;
she spoke exquisite <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and fluent--if somewhat
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stilted</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>.  On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> occasion I asked her to translate
a document into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> describing the modus
operandi of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illegals</ENAMEX> program.  It was then
passed to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> office, which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week later</TIMEX> returned
it, politely reporting that they couldn't make
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> or tail of it.  I took a paragraph at random and
passed it to another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX>, asking him to render it
into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, and the problem became immediately
apparent.

            The original contained the sentence, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúThe Soviet</ENAMEX>
Illegal, blending with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populace</ENAMEX>, is free of the unwelcome
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">limelight</ENAMEX> cast on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soviet</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embassy</ENAMEX> by the local security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  What came back
was, ‚ÄúThe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> threw a burning citrus <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> at the
Slavic bandit, who was disguised as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>; they
missed him but hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            I called for Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ban</ENAMEX> and told her I would read
the document to her, paragraph by paragraph.  She
was to ask any questions she wanted to, and when she
understood the passage, she was to render it freely into
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX>, without attempting to make a verbatim
translation.  It worked beautifully.

            In the course of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> session with Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ban</ENAMEX>,
the word cipher came up; she did not understand it.  I
started to explain, and then noticed a copy of The
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> Review on my desk.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúHere</ENAMEX>,‚Äù I said, turning
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Literary Cryptogram</ENAMEX>.  ‚ÄúThis is a cipher.  It's a
short quotation from some well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, with
his name.  For every letter, another one has been substituted,
so you can't read it.  You have to puzzle it out.‚Äù

            She picked up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, inspected the cryptogram,
frowned, nodded, and left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>.  She was
back within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fifteen minutes</TIMEX> with the correct solution
inked in over the mono-alphabetical cipher.  I was
stunned.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúMrs.</ENAMEX> Ban,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúVery few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> could
work that out without being taught how to go about
it.  Would you mind explaining how you did it?‚Äù

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúSure.</ENAMEX>  You say name is well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>.  Name
is XQ PLRZADLTRQTXF.  I look at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> name, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> letters.
Only <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> first names with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> letters are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al</ENAMEX> , and you got no famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>
named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed or Al</ENAMEX> .  So I think maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">particule --‚ÄúDe‚Äù</ENAMEX>
or ‚ÄúLa‚Äù--hey!  Maybe ‚ÄúLa Rochefoucauld
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">!‚Äù  And</ENAMEX>, yes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ls</ENAMEX>, as, os , and us all come out in right
place.  So I write in up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">above</NUMEX>, and rest is easy.  Fun!  You
got more?‚Äù

            I gave her a raise on the spot.




         
         

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúThe Joys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oys of Yiddish‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XV,3</NUMEX>], Messrs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lederer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schenkerman</ENAMEX> put the word cockamamy
(or cockamamie ) at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a list of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> words
found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as published in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Webster's Third New</ENAMEX>
International <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX> .  I have spoken <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> since
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">childhood</ENAMEX>, have a fairly wide reading knowledge and
acquaintance with various levels and styles of the language,
but have never come across a word or phrase
resembling cockamamy .  It simply has no meaning in
that language.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leo Rosten</ENAMEX> may list it in his book, The
Joys of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> , but he fails to make a positive identification.
As for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun moll</ENAMEX> , there was no phrase in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> or Odessa underworlds like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúgonif molly</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  If I
am not mistaken, the word moll is a well-rooted native
word in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> going back at least as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daniel</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defoe</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moll Flanders</ENAMEX> .  The gun part derives plainly
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> .

            As for schnoz , it does sound <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>, there does
exist a verb schneitzen `to blow one's nose,' and the
shn - combination does connote something to do with
the nose; but there is no word shnozzle in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>, only
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noz</ENAMEX> or, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternate dialect</ENAMEX>, nuz .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phudnik</ENAMEX> is not a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> word but was clearly formed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>
root -nik , which also occurs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Slavic</ENAMEX>.  I don't know
where the -sh sound arose in nebbish , but in all eastern
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> dialects of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> the word is nebbikh or
nebbakh , with a velar fricative sound that is rendered
as -sh by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> who find that easier to pronounce.

company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> asked the name of the new
piece, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kid Ory</ENAMEX> had not yet named.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lil Armstrong</ENAMEX>,
who was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pianist</ENAMEX> for the session, improvised
the answer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúThat</ENAMEX>'s named `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Muskrat Ramble'</ENAMEX>; isn't
that right, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Red?‚Äù</ENAMEX>  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kid Ory</ENAMEX>'s nickname.)  Ory
replied, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúThat</ENAMEX>'s right.‚Äù  I remember that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lil Armstrong</ENAMEX>
was quoted on the record sleeve as giving this explanation;
although I still have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LP</ENAMEX>, the sleeve was destroyed
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years ago</TIMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blurb</ENAMEX> went on to explain
that at a subsequent time some record <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> executive
decided that ‚ÄúMuskrat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramble‚Äù</ENAMEX> was too inelegant
a title and changed its name on future pressing to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúMuskat</ENAMEX> [or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muscat</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramble</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äù  My LP</ENAMEX>, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>,
gives the title as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúMuskrat Ramble</ENAMEX>.‚Äù





         
         

            As always, it was a delight to read the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>.
It is even more fun, though, to catch our omniscient
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> in a small blooper.  The comment on square
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> in the review of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loose Cannons</ENAMEX> & Red Herrings
[XV<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX>] misses the point when it states, ‚Äú...there
is no mathematical way of calculating the dimensions of
a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> with the same area as that of a given circle.‚Äù
This classic geometrical problem requires that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> start
with a given circle and construct a square of the same
area, using the straight-edge and compass, the only
tools permitted the geometer.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mathematician</ENAMEX>, on the other hand, can calculate
the dimensions of such a square, to any desired
degree of accuracy, using simple algebra.  You can
quibble, of course, that such an answer can never be
perfect, but that has nothing to do with the problem
of squaring the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">circle geometrically</ENAMEX>.

as is the definition given.  As a youngster in The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bronx</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1930s</TIMEX>, I would occasionally take my windfall
of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few pennies</NUMEX> to the local candy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and buy a
strip of cockamamies , `comic-style cartoons in brilliant
colors, each <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about an inch by an inch and a half</NUMEX>,
transferable to forearm or forehead by wetting,' preferably
with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saliva</ENAMEX> to make things agreeably messy.  As we
grew older we came to realize that cockamamie was
merely a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s distortion of decalcomania .  Later,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cockamamie</ENAMEX> came to mean `cheap, sleazy, gaudy,
trashy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junky</ENAMEX>'--but never ‚Äúmixed-up, ridiculous.‚Äù  I'll
accept the word as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bronxism</ENAMEX>, but not as an exclusive
property of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish language</ENAMEX>.




         
         

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxey Brooke</ENAMEX> writes [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XV,2</NUMEX>] that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tamale</ENAMEX> is
from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tamale</ENAMEX> .  There is, however, no such <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>
word.  Rather, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> explanations may be offered for
this <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word.  My explanation is that English-speakers
borrowed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> plural tamales (whose singular
is tamal ), from which they back-formed a new
singular, tamale (i.e., the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> into morphemes in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">tamal-es</ENAMEX> whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English-speakers</ENAMEX> took it to
be tamale-s ).  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English</ENAMEX> has both frijol and frijole , the
latter of which may be explained in the same way:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English-speakers</ENAMEX> borrowed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> plural frijoles
(whose singular is frijol ), from which they back-formed
a new singular, frijole (again, the morpheme
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">frijol-es</ENAMEX> whereas certain English-speakers
took it to be frijole-s ).  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">frijol</ENAMEX> , on the
other hand, is derived straightforwardly from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singular</ENAMEX>.

            A different explanation of tamale was offered in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Speech</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48, 3-4, 1973</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 292: ‚</ENAMEX>ÄúJust as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> recalls that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> words should be stressed
on the final syllable, he recalls, or thinks he recalls,
that all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> words should end with a vowel: sombrero ,
se√±orita , noche and so on.  These items are all in
the singular.  Thus, by analogy, many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> make
tamale , instead of the correct tamal , the singular of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tamales</ENAMEX> ....  By the same analogy, equipal , the splint
and leather patio chair so popular in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, becomes
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipale</ENAMEX> ....‚Äù

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> explanation is possible, though numerous
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> words end in a consonant and I don't
know how the two explanations could be verified.  The
least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> may say is that no <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> dictionary published
through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> gives a fully correct etymology for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tamale</ENAMEX> or frijol(e) .

            An <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">noun</ENAMEX> which is definitely back-formed
from a plural is blints (often misspelled <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúblintz‚Äù</ENAMEX>).  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Yiddish</ENAMEX>
has (singular) blintse / (plural) blintses , hence
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blints</ENAMEX> is an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> innovation.  Interestingly, whereas
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tamale</ENAMEX> and frijole have acquired a nonetymological
vowel, blints has lost an etymological vowel.  In general,
back-formation of new singulars from plurals is a
sign that the plural is textually more frequent than the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">singular</ENAMEX> (indeed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX> lists
only frijoles and no singular form whatsoever for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>).

            After the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">singulars</ENAMEX> emerged in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, new
plurals were formed.  Although <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tamales</ENAMEX> , frijoles ,
and blintses , as now usually pronounced, appear
to be derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tamales</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">frijoles</ENAMEX> ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> blintses , they are actually innovations,
formed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> by the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> -s (in the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases) or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-es</ENAMEX> (in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>) to the innovative
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> singulars.  This is proven by the fact that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plurals</ENAMEX> are pronounced with [z] and not, as in
the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> plurals, with [s].
That is, since <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> [s] > <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> [z]
would be phonologically unlikely here, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-es</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plurals</ENAMEX> are the native <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> plural allomorphs
rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>- or <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>-origin allomorphs.
Only among the few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who pronounce
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> plurals with [s] are these words derived
from the plurals used in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>.  Generally,
these are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> strongly influenced by one of these
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> languages.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brooke</ENAMEX>'s derivation of machete from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> macho
`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX>' is a folk etymology: the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words are unconnected
and the correct etymology may be found on

            Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malaprop</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>



            Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malaprop</ENAMEX> is so <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> that I thought her
‚Äúnice derangement of epitaphs‚Äù was a glory
peculiar to our language.  But then I lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>
and soon knew better.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> malapropism
I heard, or recognized as such, was spoken at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chole</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dur√°n</ENAMEX>'s refreshment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booth</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jocotepec</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalisco</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Do√±a Faustina</ENAMEX> was bringing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chole</ENAMEX> up to the
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minute</TIMEX>, and in the course of her gossip she mentioned
that her niece <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Socorro</ENAMEX> had been gr√°vida but was now
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aliviada</ENAMEX> .  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmhands</ENAMEX> were also at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booth</ENAMEX>, drinking in the prattle with their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsis</ENAMEX>.  When
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faustina</ENAMEX> left, one of them asked the other, ‚ÄúHave you
ever been gr√°vido ?‚Äù

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúJust</ENAMEX> once, when I was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>.  But my mother
bought me some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX> and I got over it.‚Äù

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chole</ENAMEX> tried not to laugh, but she laughed.  When
she explained to us that gr√°vida means `pregnant,' the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">farmhands</ENAMEX> loved the joke, their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> eyes bright
with amusement.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of them explained that they
thought gr√°vido was a more educated form of grave ,
which means `gravely ill.'  As for aliviada , it means
being `alleviated or cured.'  When a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is born, it is
as if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> had recovered from a disease.

            After that, with my ears attuned, I heard malapropisms
on all sides, and even recognized that I
committed them myself.  For a while, I confused ejote
`string <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bean</ENAMEX>,' elote `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> on the cob,' and olote `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corncob</ENAMEX>'
(I fired the water heater with dried corncobs).
Poor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lola</ENAMEX>, who cooked and cleaned for me, had to
divine what I meant when I asked for corncobs as a
dinner vegetable or remarked that we were almost out
of string <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX> for the water heater.  I was also guilty of
asking her to serve a pork chop in adobe rather than
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adobo</ENAMEX> .  The latter is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> related to the mole that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moctezuma</ENAMEX> served to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cort√©s.</ENAMEX>  The former, of course, is
a mud of another color.

            Even so, I never blundered as badly as the dowager
staying at the little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel La Quinta</ENAMEX>.  She was on a
diet that forbade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, so she left the
dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> before the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>.  When she
reached the doorway she always turned, gave a stately
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nod</ENAMEX>, and said, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúExcusado</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  Obviously she thought she
was saying, ‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù and no one could find the
courage to tell her that excusado was a euphemism for
what we call, among other things, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">john</ENAMEX>.

            In the back yard next to mine, young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mateo</ENAMEX>
sometimes raised his voice in malapropistic song.  On
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> occasion, what I heard over the wall was his version
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúSiete Leguas</ENAMEX>,‚Äù a ballad about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pancho Villa</ENAMEX>
that begins:



<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leagues</ENAMEX> was the horse
That <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villa</ENAMEX> liked best.
            

            But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mateo</ENAMEX> changed leguas to lenguas , which means
`tongues,' literally, or `languages.'  Was this remarkable
horse a polyglot?  No wonder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villa</ENAMEX> esteemed it.  On
another, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mateo warbled ‚ÄúOjitos de capul√≠n</ENAMEX>,‚Äù a familiar
mariachi song.  A capul√≠n is a small, shiny-black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>,
and the title means that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚Äúlittle eyes‚Äù</ENAMEX>--the
diminutive of affection, with no hint that she was
beady-eyed--were dark and lustrous.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mateo</ENAMEX>'s version,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">capul√≠n</ENAMEX> became chapul√≠n , which means `grasshopper.'
So she was not beady-eyed, but bug-eyed.

            Small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are often malapropists, especially
when they have to memorize texts they cannot understand.
My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>, when small, asked our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> if we
lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.  On being assured that we did, she
asked why they told her in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> that we live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tizzavy</ENAMEX>.
It turned out that she was referring to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúMy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>,
'tis of thee....‚Äù

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lola</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Teresa</ENAMEX>, was almost as inventive,
and again it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Prayer</ENAMEX>.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> it begins,
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúPadre nuestro que est√°s en los cielos</ENAMEX>, santificado
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sea tu</ENAMEX> nombre.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Teresa</ENAMEX> changed cielos to celos and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">santificado</ENAMEX> to santo pintado , so that in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Biblical English</ENAMEX>
it comes out something like, ‚ÄúOur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX> which art in
jealousies, painted saint be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thy</ENAMEX> name.‚Äù  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> reminds
me of ‚ÄúI the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord thy</ENAMEX> God am a jealous God,‚Äù
and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is not as far-fetched as it seems.  Although
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">santo</ENAMEX> means `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">saint</ENAMEX>,' a santo as an object means
a religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> carved of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>, covered with gesso,
carved in detail, and then painted.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teresa</ENAMEX> might have
been thinking of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jocotepec</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El</ENAMEX> se√±or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del monte</ENAMEX> `The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mountain</ENAMEX>,' a nearly life-sized
santo of the crucified <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> that is believed to
have been found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> of a tree in the mountains
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">south</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>.

            Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lola</ENAMEX>, too, was a malapropist.  I bought a
packet of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burpee</ENAMEX>'s zinnia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> in a pharmacy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guadalajara</ENAMEX>,
and when the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> bloomed I asked her
what they were called in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúNormalginas</ENAMEX>,‚Äù she
said.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Next day</TIMEX>, showing them off to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX>, I was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gently</ENAMEX> told that the correct word was ‚Äúdamasquinas,‚Äù
with its exotic evocation of damask and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Damascus</ENAMEX>.
When I asked him what ‚Äúnormalginas‚Äù meant, if anything,
he said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Normalgina</ENAMEX> was the trade name of
a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> analgesic much like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anacin</ENAMEX>.

            I decided to try it the next time I felt gr√°vido .

            For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> I have engaged in the often useful habit
of reading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forewords, Prefaces, Prolegomena</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Introductions</ENAMEX>,
and other bits that appear at the beginnings
of books.  It is a practice to be recommended for one or
more of several reasons: one can often be spared reading
through a boring, badly conceived, or abominably
written work; one can determine quite readily why the
book was written and what its argument, or point,
might be, then read the text to judge whether the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s purpose has been carried out.  Such front matter
(as it is more commonly called in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>), or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prelims</ENAMEX> (so called in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>), is usually written by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> (or one of them).  There is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preface</ENAMEX> to this
book, written by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">estimable</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Whitcut</ENAMEX>, which I
shall get to in a moment.  First, though, is an essay,
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúWhat's the Usage?</ENAMEX>,‚Äù  by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inestimable</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Epstein</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Scholar</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of something
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwestern University</ENAMEX>, and self-styled
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseud</ENAMEX>.  I hadn't noticed who had written the essay till I
encountered the following, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">barely three</NUMEX> paragraphs
into the writing:



It is closer to the truth to say that woolly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">circumlocutions</ENAMEX>,
psychobabblous phrasing and sentiments,
and language used as if it were a game of horseshoes
(in which one expects points for being close)
offends me.
            

            Well, they offends me too, especially when they
appears in the lead essay of a book on style and usage
and particularly when it are a book of this quality.  I
saw little point in continuing reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Epstein</ENAMEX> when I
was sure that matters could only improve by turning to
Gowers, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenbaum</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitcut</ENAMEX>, all of whom could
be relied on to make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and predicates agree in
number.

            Putting outright, downright grammatical solecisms
aside, it would be pertinent to reiterate my own
attitude toward usage: as a linguist, I regard usage
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clinically</ENAMEX> and would no more criticize a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> or a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> of any kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúmistakes‚Äù</ENAMEX> than a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> would criticize a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> for contracting appendicitis
or the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX> waste-away; on the other hand, as
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> (albeit a poor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>), I attend to matters of style
(which includes usage and grammar, of course), not
only in others' writing but my own.  As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> are
quick to point out, my attention to such matters occasionally
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wanders</ENAMEX>, for which I offer no excuses.  Yet the
sense of discovery in finding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Epsteinisms</ENAMEX> is undiminished,
though any glee is mitigated by the feeling of
embarrassment undoubtedly shared among <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David R.</ENAMEX>
Godine, respected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenbaum</ENAMEX> and
Whitcut, respected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Complete Plain Words</ENAMEX> , an
edited amalgan of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Plain Words</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The ABC</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Plain Words</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX>), appeared in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</TIMEX>; an edition
revised by Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Fraser</ENAMEX> was published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>; the
present work, published by <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Her Majesty's Stationery</ENAMEX>
Office (stolidly called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúHer Britannic Majesty's Stationary</ENAMEX>
[ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Office‚</ENAMEX>Äù on the copyright page) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> to
celebrate its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bicentennial</TIMEX>, is a revision of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fraser</ENAMEX>'s edition.
As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitcut</ENAMEX> carefully indicates in her <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preface</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">chapters 3-14</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> are ‚Äúalmost pure <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Gowers</ENAMEX>....  In
this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> edition `we' generally represents Greenbaum
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Whitcut</ENAMEX>....‚Äù  I spent some time ferreting about
in the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> and am pleased to report (as I
suspected) a sane and sensible approach (in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 15</ENAMEX>)
to such topics as ‚ÄúThe trend towards informality‚Äù (the
language, even in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, is loosening up), ‚ÄúThe objections
to sexist <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">language‚Äù (‚ÄúPresent</ENAMEX> usage is unstable.
...[<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fficial writers</ENAMEX> [ought] to take evasive action.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>),
‚ÄúThe influence of science and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">technology‚Äù (‚Äú</ENAMEX>[ <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">I</ENAMEX> ] nput

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">user-friendly</ENAMEX> ....<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>), ‚ÄúThe influences of other varieties
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English‚Äù</ENAMEX> (in which one can find good examples
of so-called Americanisms that were formerly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>).

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> pull no punches, characterizing one
government memorandum as ‚Äúspoilt by carelessness,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clich√©s</ENAMEX> and flaccidity,‚Äù another as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúrather stilted</ENAMEX>...
[but] by no means outrageous,‚Äù <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a third as ‚Äúverbose</NUMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stilted,‚Äù</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> as ‚Äúcontaining wording and
punctuation that is clumsy, ambiguous, and redundant.‚Äù
For each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> specimens selected for analysis
and comment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenbaum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitcut</ENAMEX> offer not only
criticism but cogent suggestions for improvement.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sixth</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> selections, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> expository, one narrative,
merit the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>' praise: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúgraceful‚</ENAMEX>Äù
are used in the comments; other adjectives are clear
(structure), manageable (sentence length), appropriate
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">vocabulary</NUMEX>), delicate (shifts of language level),
and vivid .

            The final chapter, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>, consists of a checklist of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúwords</ENAMEX> and phrases to be used with care.‚Äù  The inevitable
old chestnuts are here-- <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">infer</ENAMEX>/imply , appraise/
apprise , etc.--but most of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250 or so</NUMEX> entries in these
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-odd pages deal with matters of style, word selection,
and the avoidance of pompous or meaningless
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clich√©s.</ENAMEX>  For instance,



Accordingly Prefer so or therefore.

According to You can replace `According to our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX>' by `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Our records show</ENAMEX>'....

Condition (noun) If you mean rule, says so.
            

            ...and so forth.  Some of the entries are longer than
these, but not many.  Missing is the horrid at this point
in time , but that probably occurs more in speech than
in writing.  For a short list, it is a good one.

            Of course, there is not much point in having any
list unless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> use it, which brings me to my main
criticism of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> of a ‚Äúcertain‚Äù <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> (say,
under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>) and education level.  To put the matter differently,
I could write an essay called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúThe Perils of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Literacy‚Äù or ‚ÄúA Little Literacy Is a Dangerous Thing</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
Much of the ineffectual use of language is traceable to
the fact that although many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> want to improve
their language, they are completely unfamiliar with
the help available to them.  How, for example, are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to know whether to use infer or imply if they
are totally unaware that any problem exists?  For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have pronounced the word KONtr\?\v\?\rsee;
then, some odd <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> came along saying k\?\nTROV\?\rsee,
and the faith of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> was shaken.
If they had looked it up in a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>, which lists the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pronunciation</ENAMEX>(s) used by a majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>, k\?\nTROV\?\rsee
would never have surfaced.

            To be useful, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Complete Plain Words and</ENAMEX>
other books like it must be read through .  Then, when
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are about to use infer or imply , a small voice
should whisper, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúI</ENAMEX> seem to recall that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gower</ENAMEX> [or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fowler</ENAMEX> , or some other work, including every medium-sized
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX>] had something on that,‚Äù occasioning
a quick look-up that would resolve the question at
once.  But if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are not humble enough to doubt
their own control over the vast complexities of the language
and if, to boot, they are ignorant of the content
of even the most basic available resources, then any
hope of their learning how literate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> express
themselves is lost.

            One <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Who Goes Everywhere: The Ubiquarian's Dictionary</ENAMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX>, brain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>,
and anyone else who wants to get into the act
have all speculated on the way the mind works.  To be
persuaded about the myriad possibilities, one need
only visit a library.  Tucked away in one corner is a
collection of books on how to improve your memory,
most of which offer different techniques.  None suggests
plain rote drilling: all suggest a pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>,
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alphabetical</ENAMEX>, some psychological, some numerical,
and so forth.  Each has validity for the ‚Äúkind of
mind‚Äù a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> has.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susanna Cuyler</ENAMEX>'s book begins
with the suggestion ‚ÄúMake up a sentence, say it aloud.
For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ablaqueate</ENAMEX> ( to loosen ground around
roots ): `<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Absalom</ENAMEX>, come up from the lake and help me
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ablaqueate</ENAMEX>.‚Äù'  That might work for you, but I would
forget the sentence (especially <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Absalom</ENAMEX>, my main association
with the name being with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaucer</ENAMEX>'s ribald
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tale</ENAMEX> ).

            Memorizing words is not the point of this book
which, in addition to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> titles, has a subtitle: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúA</ENAMEX>
literary distillation of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster's International</ENAMEX> , and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrne</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Unusual, Obscure and Preposterous Words</ENAMEX> .‚Äù
The book is a list of words, with remarkably succinct
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">definitions</ENAMEX>, that have captured the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s fancy for
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason or another.  Some are interesting and have a
curiosity value ( spaneria `a scarceness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'), others,
if learnt, would present some difficulties in fitting into
most conversations ( umber `sundial pointer's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shadow</ENAMEX>').
Like any written work, this one could stand some improving
( urbicolous `urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domiciled</ENAMEX>' could, less awkwardly
have been `<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>-dwelling').

            It is not often useful but frequently great fun to
have at hand a short, attractively packaged list of
weird and wonderful words to carry about in your
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pocket</ENAMEX>.  If you agree, send <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10</NUMEX> to the address at the top
of this review.  If the photograph on the back cover, of
an extremely attractive lady swinging, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tarzan</ENAMEX>-like,
through the jungle, is of Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuyler</ENAMEX>, send your order
in quickly, for she appears to be in sad need of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wardrobe</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Urdang</ENAMEX>
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Facts On File Encyclopedia of Word and</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phrase Origins</ENAMEX>

            This is a good book and an interesting book.  According
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preface</ENAMEX>, it covers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some 7500</TIMEX>
words and phrases, and its great fault is that it lacks an
index.  That is to say, there are about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4000</TIMEX> or so main
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entries</ENAMEX>, the rest of the terms being discussed within the
entries; unless they begin with the same letter or
words, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> will be unable to find them without an
index.  For example, tsar, tsarina , etc., are discussed at
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">czar</ENAMEX> , but there is no cross reference in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ts</ENAMEX> for the
tsar words and, if you didn't think (or know) to look
under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">czar</ENAMEX> , you would think them missing.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Publishers</ENAMEX>
ought to learn that they cannot always anticipate the
needs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of books and that indexes are almost
invariably an aid in finding things.

            My other complaint is about compositors (and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proofreaders</ENAMEX>) who set loose lines because they do not
know how to hyphenate the word they have carried
over to a following line.  Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compositors</ENAMEX> rely far too
much on the automatic hyphenation programs packaged
with their computer typesetting systems.  A typical
example occurs (as one might expect) at the entry
for deipnosophist where a line that normally contains
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> (plus spaces), has been printed
with only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> (plus spaces), mainly, apparently,
because no one knew where to hyphen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deipnosophistai</ENAMEX> ,
the first word on the next line.  This rather ugly
phenomenon occurs here and there in this otherwise
attractive book.

            Back to the contents.  General dictionaries give
etymologies, albeit brief ones, of most of the words
they list and fulfill a useful, if limited function.  Extensive
works, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX> offer far
more elaborate information, including, where appropriate
(and available) valuable comments on the origins
of sense development.  Etymological dictionaries
do pretty much the same, though for the most part
they, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> , eschew information about multiword
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entries</ENAMEX>, idiomatic phrases, and such.  Then there
are books, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Funk</ENAMEX>'s A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Hog</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ice</TIMEX> and my own The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whole Ball</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wax</ENAMEX> , that treat the origins of particular
kinds of expressions and, occasionally, words.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hendrickson</ENAMEX>'s
book, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EWPO</ENAMEX> for short, covers some standard,
single-word entries, some oddities, a number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phrases</ENAMEX> and expressions, and a good selection of items
not covered by most of the other books.

            Much of what appears is well established; some of
it is speculative, some taken from unreliable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>,
and some at variance with the accepted scholarship.
For instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allen Walker Read</ENAMEX>'s widely accepted etymology
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.K.</ENAMEX> is just the reverse of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hendrickson's</ENAMEX>--the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.K.</ENAMEX> of oll korrect was adopted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Van</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buren (‚ÄúOld Kinderhook‚Äù</ENAMEX>) as a campaign cry, not the
other way round.  At horse <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">latitudes</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> has
picked up the theory that it comes from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äú golfo de las
yeguas , `gulf of the mares,' which was the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>
name for the ocean between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> and the Canary
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islands</ENAMEX> and compares the supposed fickleness of mares
with the fickle winds in these latitudes.‚Äù  As far as I
have been able to determine, golfo de las yeguas is a
complete fiction, for there is no evidence for any such
designation in any gazetteer that I could find nor at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Geographical Society</ENAMEX>.  Besides, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> latitudes
referred to were in the doldrums, which occur
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">west</ENAMEX>, not east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX>.  I comment on that in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ball</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wax</ENAMEX> .

            My current theory runs as follows: the Sargasso
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea</ENAMEX>, a region northeast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Indies</ENAMEX>, is characterized
as an area of relative calm and an abundance
of sargassum , an entangling seaweed.  As such seaweeds
thrive in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf Stream</ENAMEX>, they are generally called
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gulfweeds</ENAMEX> .  In all likelihood, the region was originally
known as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">golfo del mar</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>, that is, `gulf of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sea</ENAMEX>,' and was so entered on charts.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>
who used the charts read mar as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mare `female horse</ENAMEX>,'
which was later generalized to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> .  Another possibility
is that the origin was <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">golfe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la</ENAMEX> mer or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">latitude de la</ENAMEX> mer , <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> mer being quite close in
sound to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mare</ENAMEX> , which was later generalized to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> .  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> possibility is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> were populated
by manatees, which might have been likened to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>, not too farfetched a suggestion when one considers
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> are said to have imagined them to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mermaids</ENAMEX>.  The theory that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">latitudes</ENAMEX> were so
named because mariners becalmed there threw overboard
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> they were transporting because they
died of thirst or starved seems almost impossible: in
order for such an event to have given rise to horse
latitudes it would have to have recurred many times,
and it is hard to believe that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th- and 17th-century</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mariners</ENAMEX> were so improvident as to have allowed that
to happen very often.  Thus, I cannot accept <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hendrickson</ENAMEX>'s
origin for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">latitudes</ENAMEX> , though, to give him his
due, he only copied the etymology from other sources,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> included.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baker</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozen</NUMEX> of other matters:

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.  At <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hore-Belisha</ENAMEX> , the information is given that
the pedestrian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crosswalk signals</ENAMEX> are ‚Äúoften called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hore-Belishas ‚Äù</ENAMEX>;
in my experience, the term is usually Belisha
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">beacon</ENAMEX> .

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.  At heliotrope , some might miss the point without
the information that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> god of
the sun.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.  At guerilla : the usual spelling is guerrilla .  (It
comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> guerra `war.')

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.  Perhaps the mystery of the origin of the verb
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goose</ENAMEX> might be cleared up by examining the opening
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter of Gargantua</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rabelais</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.  Under gibson cocktail , it is not made with a
‚Äúpearl onion‚Äù [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ugh</ENAMEX>!] but with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pickled pearl onion</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>.  I have serious doubts about the purported origin
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flea</ENAMEX> market and its dating to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> colonial
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>.  The change from numble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pie</ENAMEX> to umble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pie</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">humble pie</ENAMEX> , attributed to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúsome anonymous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">punster</ENAMEX> in
the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William the Conqueror,‚Äù</ENAMEX> was actually due
to the same influences that changed a napron to an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apron</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> instance and to the characteristic
weakening of the initial h in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, heard <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in
an historical, an hilarious , etc.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>.  Coffin nail is a later allusion to `cigarette': in
its earlier metaphoric life it referred to anything that
might serve to drive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to an early grave; indeed,
some early Western saloons sold tokens bearing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">words ‚Äúcoffin nail‚Äù stamped</ENAMEX> on them which were good
for a shot of redeye.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humongous</ENAMEX> is given as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúa</ENAMEX> term for a huge,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monstrous person‚Äù</ENAMEX>: it merely means `huge, monstrous'
and, as far as I know, has nothing to do with wrestlers
or, necessarily, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.

            10.  At hung higher than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gilderoy</ENAMEX>'s kite the author
glosses kite as `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX>'; it is actually a word for `belly.'

            11.  There is a theory that the curious expression
(from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>), It is harder for a rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> to enter the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">kingdom of</ENAMEX> heaven than for a camel to go through the
eye of a needle results from a misreading of the original:
the original, it is said, has a word meaning `rope,'
not `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">camel</ENAMEX>,' which makes sense (to me).  I cannot insist
that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hendrickson</ENAMEX> accept the theory, but he ought at
least to have acknowledged its existence; instead, we are
told that ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX> walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> had a
rear gate called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Needle's Eye</ENAMEX> through which a camel
could pass only if kneeling down.  How camels move
forward while kneeling is not explained--perhaps, pace
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>--that is (also) the true origin of skid row .

            12.  Comments like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúThe cuckoo</ENAMEX> was so named for
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-note song it repeats over and over‚Äù came from
someone who has never heard the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>'s disyllabic call.

            13.  At <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Eggs</ENAMEX> Benedict we learn that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar</ENAMEX> of the
Waldorf concocted the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX> on the inspiration
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Benedict</ENAMEX> who ordered something similar
as a hangover cure.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar</ENAMEX> is credited with having introduced
the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> muffins to the recipe in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1894</TIMEX>, which I find somewhat anachronistic as they
(being neither <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> nor muffins) did not exist before
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid 1920s</TIMEX>.

            A glance at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúMost Frequently Cited Authorities‚</ENAMEX>Äù
reveals the possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>(s) of some of these
aberrations: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Partridge's Origins and Shipley's Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Word Origins</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the most notorious
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of misinformation on etymology.  Moreover,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Its Analogues</ENAMEX> is attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Farmer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. E. ‚ÄúHurley</ENAMEX>,‚Äù the latter's name being,
properly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley</ENAMEX>.  It would appear, then, that Hendrickson
has combined his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> for any information
he could glean, repeating indiscriminately his choices
of that which is most colorful.  If you have occasion to
refer to this work, it would be well to keep in mind
that it can be relied on for picturesque etymologies but
not, necessarily, accurate ones.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Urdang</ENAMEX>
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Kangaroo's Comments & Wallaby's Words</ENAMEX>
            This useful book is divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main parts:
pages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 to 130</TIMEX> consist of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> of text dealing
with various aspects of (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX>) life and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fauna</ENAMEX>; there follow <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two glossaries</NUMEX>-cum-index, one in
which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australianisms</ENAMEX> are translated into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, the other listing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> words and expressions
with their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> equivalents; both give references
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> in which they are treated.  The
difficulty with the reference system is that one cannot
tell where to find <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 4</ENAMEX>, say, till he leafs through
to the end of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> or the beginning of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.  It would have
helped to have given the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> numbers in running
heads at the book's foredge.

            Another objection is that the terms identified as
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> are not, necessarily, exclusively so.  For example,
serviette, scone, sheila, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Smarties</ENAMEX>, spanner,
spot on, squash, starkers , just to pick a handful, are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Briticisms</ENAMEX>; although the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> makes that clear, it
seems odd that the words and expressions that are direct
borrowings from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British English</ENAMEX> are not individually
identified as such.  That, however, is not the purpose of
the book, so it might seem carping of me to bring it up.
Also, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> acknowledges, ‚ÄúThis is not meant to
be a definitive lexicon of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>,‚Äù a true
enough statement even without the extraneous hyphen.

            Although the text makes clear the nature of things
like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sausage rolls (‚Äú minced</ENAMEX> (ground up) sausage meat
wrapped in pastry, fried, then kept warm for takeaway‚Äù),
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glossary</ENAMEX> identifies them as ‚Äútakeout
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">snack</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which would mislead the casual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> (of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glossary</ENAMEX>) to infer that all takeout <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snacks</ENAMEX> are called
sausage rolls .

            These criticisms having been made, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Kangaroo</ENAMEX>'s
Comments is nonetheless an interesting, rather well-done
guide to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australianisms</ENAMEX> it covers, and travelers
down under would be well advised to use it.  It
might also prove useful to those who cannot understand
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Hogan</ENAMEX>'s films (or commercials).
