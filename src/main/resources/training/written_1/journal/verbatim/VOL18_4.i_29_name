            As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 60s</TIMEX>, I remember starting a
school year learning the names of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> a
certain way in geography <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>, only to end the year
with the old names scratched out, replaced by new
ones as scores of former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> became independent,
with (usually) new names.  Bechuanaland
became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Botwana</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gold Coast</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ghana</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Guiana</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guyana</ENAMEX>, and so on.  Now, a
generation later, we seem to be going through another
period when names are changing.  As frustrating
as this might be, it does have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> advantage of
providing plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ammunition</ENAMEX> for games of oneupmanship
!  Personally, I like to keep my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> properly informed and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to date</TIMEX> and do
not hesitate to correct them when they refer to, for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">instance, ‚ÄúIvory Coast‚Äù</ENAMEX> (it is now PC to say C√¥te
d<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">'Ivoire</ENAMEX>, even in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>), or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúBurma‚Äù</ENAMEX> (which is, of
course, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Myanmar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">capital city Yangon</ENAMEX>, not ‚ÄúRangoon‚Äù).
My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>--those who remain--rarely fail
to thank me for this service.

            Why do names change, and why do different
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> refer to the same place by different names?
In spite of this neo-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puritan</ENAMEX> trends towards PC `politically
correct' nomenclature, with all the presure to
conform that it brings, there are still sometimes perfectly
good reasons for changing the name of a place.
It is when the trend is carried to sanctimonious extremes
that it becomes irritating.

            The most widely-known example of PC name-changing
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> is not that of a place-name but
of an ethnic or racial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Black Americans</ENAMEX>.  In
my youth the acceptable term for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Blacks</ENAMEX> was Negroes
or Coloureds .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coloured</ENAMEX> seems to have come to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North America</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>, where it actually
refers to mulattoes, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of mixed race.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Negro</ENAMEX>, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish/Portuguese</ENAMEX> word for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">`black</ENAMEX>'
seems to have been a euphemism, a softer term, and
replaced the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> term, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX> .  With the rise of
Black consciousness and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX> pride, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Blacks</ENAMEX> challenged
the need for a euphemism (the very use of
which implies, of course, something bad or negative,
which has to be rendered pleasant or acceptable).  I
can sympathize, therefore, with their rejection of
the term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Negro</ENAMEX> as a racist term.  Lately the terms
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">African-American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afro</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> seem to be
gaining wider acceptance, although according to a
recent poll most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Blacks</ENAMEX> prefer the term Black;
perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> is still too avant garde.

            Just to add another wrinkle, the stylebook of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.K.</ENAMEX>-based international news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Economist</ENAMEX>
makes the eminently sensible observation that
not all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Africans</ENAMEX> are black; ‚ÄúAfricans may be black or
white.  If you mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>, write <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  Strictly</ENAMEX>
speaking, then, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Economist</ENAMEX>, would a
white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugee</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ian Smith</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhodesia</ENAMEX> now living
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> be justified in calling himself an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúAfrican-American‚Äù</ENAMEX>?
Somehow I do not think that that is
what most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have in mind when they hear
or read the term.

            As another example, the indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic</ENAMEX> are, as far as I know, still commonly referred
to in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eskimos</ENAMEX>; but for
some time now the PC term in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> has been <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX>,
a term which affords great scope for PC snobbery,
as it can be fairly complicated; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inuit</ENAMEX>; the language is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Inuitituk</ENAMEX>; and an individual is
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inuk</ENAMEX>.  This attention to detail is, however, devotion
to PC-ness above and beyond the call of duty,
and in usual practice most educated or academic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canadians</ENAMEX> now use <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> as a comprehensive adjective
and noun.  The reason <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> has made this
change is fairly complex but has to do with a fine
point of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anthropology</ENAMEX>.  According to The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian</ENAMEX>
Encyclopedia, ‚ÄúInuit simply means `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.'  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Inuit</ENAMEX>
were earlier known by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> as `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eskimos'</ENAMEX>--a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pejorative</ENAMEX>, roughly meaning `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eaters</ENAMEX> of raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>,'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to them by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">INDIAN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.  The language is
called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inuktitut</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inttituut</ENAMEX>, which is divided into
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> different dialects.‚Äù  I suppose that no one would
want to be known by a term that means `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eaters</ENAMEX> of
raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>.'  However, that does not explain why the
change seems confined to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>.  In fact, the term
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eskimo</ENAMEX> is still popularly used.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>'s best-known
popular history <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter C. Newman</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Berton</ENAMEX>, use the term almost exclusively
in works they have written on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North</ENAMEX>.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Canadian Encyclopedia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mel Hurtig</ENAMEX>,
is a well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> nationalist with leftwing
political views and probably intends that his
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">publication ‚Äúlead‚</ENAMEX>Äù public opinion.  There is also an
academic distinction between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eskimo</ENAMEX>, as
explained by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan D. Macmillan</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anthropology</ENAMEX>:


...<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> [of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic</ENAMEX>] are the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX>, who
are distinct from all other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX>.
They belong to a linguistic stock termed
Eskimo-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aleut</ENAMEX> (or `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eskaleut'</ENAMEX>), named for its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aleuts</ENAMEX>, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aleutian Islands</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX>, are the most divergent.  The
larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eskimo</ENAMEX>, has a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> near
Bering <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strait</ENAMEX>.  On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yupik</ENAMEX> comprise at
least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> separate languages in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Siberia</ENAMEX>
and central and southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX>.  On the other,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> extend from northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenland</ENAMEX>,
including all of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>,
the word `<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX>' (meaning `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'; the singular is
`<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Inuk'</ENAMEX>) has now almost totally replaced `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eskimo</ENAMEX>'
(generally, although perhaps erroneously, believed
to be derived from a derogatory Algonkian
term meaning `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eaters</ENAMEX> of raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>').  However, it
must be remembered that not all `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eskimos'</ENAMEX> are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inuit</ENAMEX>.  Throughout their vast distribution, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX>
speak a single language (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inuktitut</ENAMEX>), although a
number of dialects are known.

            One could, therefore, simplify matters by saying that
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenland</ENAMEX>--but not <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Alaskan</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siberian</ENAMEX>-- Eskimos
are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> .  Although, as it so happens,
according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macmillan</ENAMEX>, at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> Circumpolar
Conference, held in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barrow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX>
from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenland</ENAMEX> officially
adopted the term <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> formerly
known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eskimo</ENAMEX>, despite linguistic differences.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Siberians</ENAMEX> were prevented from attending at that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> for political reasons.)  These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> examples of
name changes arose out of demands made by the
ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> themselves, for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX>
objected to previous terms because they considered
them derogatory.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> examples of name changes which I find
harder to accept are the new names for what used to
be called <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burma</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">C√¥te d'Ivoire</ENAMEX>, of
course, is the literal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> equivalent of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast</ENAMEX>, and in other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> languages that country
has traditionally been called by a name which is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">literal</ENAMEX> translation of the term (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elfenbeink√</ENAMEX>ºste in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>).  So why insist on using the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> term,
when its literal meaning is identical to the traditional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX> name?  It seems that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>-for-Life
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">C√¥te d'Ivoire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Excellence F√©lix Houphouet-Boigny</ENAMEX>,
is a confirmed and impassioned francophile,
and seems intent on converting his agricultural nation
into a sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>-on-the-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guinea</ENAMEX>.  He has
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">erected</ENAMEX>, at enormous expense, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>-style
capital <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yamoussoukro</ENAMEX>, in the interior of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, and furnished it with, among other things,
an embarrassingly gauche, oversized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Catholic</ENAMEX>
basilica rumored to be larger even than <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Peter's</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vatican City</ENAMEX>--all this supposedly to serve
the spiritual needs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s francisized
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholics</ENAMEX>, who constitute <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">no more than 12%</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 to 12 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.  To make a long
story short, I am convinced that the PC-ness of C√¥te
d'Ivoire arises out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Houphouet-Boigny</ENAMEX>'s
desire to be seen as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of a linguistically and
culturally <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>.  Whether <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> chooses to
use this term or the traditional term depends, I suppose,
on how sensitive one is to the wishes of people
(or of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>) regarding the way they are
named.

            Likewise with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Myanmar</ENAMEX>, the name now used--
at least in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">non-U.S.</ENAMEX>-English-speaking world--for
what used to be called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Burma</ENAMEX> .  The official name of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burmese</ENAMEX> has, since independence
from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, been <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pyidaungsu Socialist</ENAMEX> Thammada
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myanma Naingngandaw</ENAMEX> , so <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Myanmar</ENAMEX>, it seems, is
simply <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Burmese for Burma</ENAMEX> .  This is the same phenomenon
as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">C√¥te d'Ivoire</ENAMEX> .  But the current Myanmarese
(do I venture where angels fear to tread by
coining the adjective?) regime is a repressive one
that liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western democrats</ENAMEX> view with distaste:
one could say that they could give ‚ÄúParadise‚Äù a bad
name had that been the new name chosen for their
sad little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.

            In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">C√¥te d'Ivoire</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Myanmar</ENAMEX>, well
read <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and others who pride themselves on
being <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to date</TIMEX> and informed (and therefore especially
susceptible to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚ÄúPC-itis‚Äù</NUMEX>) will use the new
terms, but with a certain amount of distaste.  The
degree to which they show their ambivalence shows
their ability to walk the trendy pseudo-liberal tightrope
of PC-ness.  ‚ÄúI use this term, but knowingly,
with reluctance‚Äù shows a certain intellectual virtuosity
which is an entrance requirement for those
who aspire to beatitude within <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">neo-Puritanism</ENAMEX>.
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gremlins of E.T.</ENAMEX>



            No, I am not referring to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Extra-Terrestrial</ENAMEX>
but to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Errors Typographical</ENAMEX> (also called typos,
for short, or, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, literals).

            During the hearings before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Judiciary</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarence Thomas</ENAMEX> read a categorical
statement denying flatly and absolutely the
charges of sexual harassment against him, but he
used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">adverbial ‚Äúuncategorically</ENAMEX>,‚Äù thus negating
the very essence of his statement.  For a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> and lifelong habit of writing, such a slip
of the pen--or tongue--readily suggests to a psychoanalytically
trained eye or ear an ambivalence, if
not a mental conflict, about the denial.

            This episode reminded me of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúWicked Bible</ENAMEX>,‚Äù
so called because the word not was omitted
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Seventh Commandment</ENAMEX>, which read ‚ÄúThou
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shalt</ENAMEX> commit adultery.‚Äù  Would it not be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.C.</ENAMEX> (no,
not `politically correct' but `psychoanalytically correct')
to assume that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">typesetter</ENAMEX>'s unconscious
played a role in such a significant error?  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúWicked Bible‚Äù</ENAMEX> was published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1631</TIMEX> by the official
printer of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">King of England</ENAMEX>, and he--the
printer, not the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King</ENAMEX>--was fined <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">300 pounds</NUMEX>, an exorbitant
amount of money in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX>.  The fine
drove him to ruin.  Was the punishment particularly
harsh because the affair reminded everyone, including
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> himself, that his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majesty</ENAMEX> behaved according
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúRevised‚Äù</ENAMEX> Commandment?

            Of course, not every typographical error should
be ascribed to a hidden unconscious motive on the
part of the typesetter (or typist).  Sometimes it is
totally innocent and does not interfere, even for a
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, with the flow of reading or comprehension.
A plea on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insanity</ENAMEX>, in a newspaper report
of a criminal trial, is promptly dismissed by the mind
and substituted with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúgrounds</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  Newspapers</ENAMEX>, particularly,
are bound to have such innocent typographical
errors because of the constant pressure of
deadlines.

            Sometimes a simple transposition of letters may
make things more complicated.  When a sentence in
a research report read ‚Äúthe results of the experiment
were nuclear,‚Äù I stopped to reread it, and
smiled when I quickly discovered that it should have
read ‚Äúunclear.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äù  Similarly, ‚Äúdensity,‚Äù</ENAMEX> in place of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">destiny</ENAMEX> , is initially confusing until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one deciphers</TIMEX>,
from the context, the true intent of the sentence.  A
lecture of mine was once described in a newspaper
as ‚Äúlight-headed,<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äù</ENAMEX> instead of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äúlight-hearted‚Äù</NUMEX> (unless
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> was being mean-spirited...).

            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">typos</ENAMEX> might be said to be ‚Äúerrors of similarity
or familiarity,‚Äù when similar or more familiar
words are substituted for the words in the manuscript.
I should include in this category (the corrected
words are in brackets) graduation recession
[procession], <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gamblers Anonymouse</ENAMEX> [anonymous],
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> Rights [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reich</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Protective Drawing</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Projective</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Doctoral Institute</ENAMEX>
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post-</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">End Quiry</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inquiry</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinical</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counter</ENAMEX>
[<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Encounter</ENAMEX>], and similar misprintes.  All these typographical
errors could easily have been avoided by a
careful reading of the galley proofs.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of typographical errors is much
more serious than a single misspelled word.  This occurs
when a line or more from the original text is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unintentionally</ENAMEX> skipped altogether, resulting in an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incomprehensible</ENAMEX>, mangled style.  I call it the propinquity
error because if often happens when the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">typesetter</ENAMEX>'s eyes make an inadvertent visual jump
from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX> to a line or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> below in the manuscript
because the same word appears in both
places.

            On rare occasions a typographical error is uncanny.
The obituary in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York Times</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">famous psychoanalyst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodor Reik</ENAMEX> ended with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sentence: ‚</ENAMEX>ÄúHis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> was created.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Reik</ENAMEX>, who loved
language, would have greatly enjoyed such a parapraxis.

            At times a typographical error is made on purpose,
as in advertisements or signs, to catch the eye
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> or passerby.  If it is a ‚Äúgood‚Äù one it
may even become a conversation topic, the very
hope of the intentional misspeller.

            The nationally famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> ‚ÄúToys `<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">\?\</ENAMEX>' Us‚Äù use
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s reversal of the letter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Similarly</ENAMEX>, the title
of the movie The \?\ussians Are Coming, The \?\ussians
Are Coming , which plays games with a letter in the
Cyrillic alphabet (which is not an r).

            During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1956</TIMEX> presidential elections the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudson County Democratic Committee</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX> erected a huge billboard sign high atop a gasoline
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holland Tunnel</ENAMEX>, which people
driving into and out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> could not help
seeing.  The sign intentionally misspelled the name
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> and read: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúOn November</ENAMEX>

Times read: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚ÄúThink</ENAMEX>!  Sign atop a gas <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> near
entrance to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holland Tunnel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jersey City</ENAMEX> bears an
intentional misspelling.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  A Committee</ENAMEX> member
stated, ‚Äúthe planned mistake paid off wonderfully

known.  Being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language and
certainly a careful speller, he most likely would have
shaken his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> at this kind of childish electioneering.

            During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1988</TIMEX> presidential campaign both
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, reading from prepared notes, made interesting
slips of the eye: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dukakis</ENAMEX> spoke
of equipping aircraft <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> with modern ‚Äúmusicians‚Äù
[<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">munitions</ENAMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúI</ENAMEX>
hope I stand for anti-bigotry, anti-Semitism, antiracism.‚Äù
These slips were essentially due to the similarity
of the initial letters or part of the word, like
the typographical errors of similarity or familiarity
cited above, but probably also due to the immense
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fatigue</ENAMEX> and exhaustion brought on by a presidential
campaign.

            When one's name is deliberately or even unconsciously
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">misspelled</ENAMEX>, or when it is knowingly mispronounced,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> perceives it as a slap at his pride.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> does not have to be psychologically sophisticated
to see in it a deliberate discourtesy, an intended
injury to his dignity.

            Missing or misplaced punctuation marks naturally
fall within the net of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.T.</ENAMEX> gremlins.  Read
the sentence ‚ÄúLet's eat, children‚Äù without the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comma</ENAMEX> and see the difference it makes.  There are
many examples of how sentences with improper
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">punctuation marks</NUMEX> sound ludicrous.  For example, a
program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> prepared in longhand a few laudatory
introductory remarks about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lecturer</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äú...
I bring you a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.  He is out of place
when among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cheaters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scoundrels</ENAMEX>.  He feels
quite at home when surrounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> of integrity...‚Äù
As if by a devilish design a number of errors
in punctuation were made in the process of
transcribing the prepared introductory notes, resulting
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúLadies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gentlemen</ENAMEX>, I bring you a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.
Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, he is out of place.  When among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cheaters</ENAMEX>

so on [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">(‚ÄúA Punctuation Parable,‚Äù VIII, 4, 16</ENAMEX>)].

            Computer errors may not technically fall within
the category of typographical print errors, but they
are nonetheless mistakes, and can be quite costly.  In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July of 1962</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spacecraft</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mariner I</ENAMEX> veered off
course <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about four minutes</TIMEX> after its launch from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canaveral</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, and had to be blown up in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">air</ENAMEX>.  The reason: an inadvertent omission of a hyphen
from the computer's mass of coded mathematical ascent
guidance instructions.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spacecraft</ENAMEX> was to
transmit scientific observations about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venus</ENAMEX> from a
distance of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36,000,000 miles</NUMEX>.  Its cost: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten million</NUMEX>
dollars.

            Every word or combination of words carries
within itself a potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.T.</ENAMEX> bug.  Even monosyllabic
words are not immune, as when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>'s familiar
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">words ‚Äúsay Aah</ENAMEX>,‚Äù while examining a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s throat,
came out in print as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúsay Haa</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            On guard against such a potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.T.</ENAMEX> viruses is
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> of professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proofreaders</ENAMEX> who, like electronic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX> searching for concealed
weapons, are supposed to weed out errors before
the final printing.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proofreaders</ENAMEX> use a special set of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marks</ENAMEX>, signs and symbols to indicate on the gallery
proofs the required corrections--deletions, insertions,
size or type of fonts (lower case letters,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">capitals</ENAMEX>, bold face), space notations (size of paragraph
indents, missing spaces between words or extra
spaces within words, type and length of dash),
etc.  To the uninitiated these marks to look like hieroglyphics
of an ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.  (See the entire p.

            I had better <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stop</ENAMEX> here.  While I am pointing out

            If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> has achieved nothing
else it has produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> magnificent acronym:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESPRIT</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Strategic Programme of Research</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Technology</ENAMEX>.  Indeed, there
might well have been equal willingness in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brussels</ENAMEX>
to launch a program in, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ichthyological Taxonomy</ENAMEX>
for the sake of such a satisfying acronym.

            Information technology was, however, the favored
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ESPRIT</ENAMEX> program was launched a
few <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years back</TIMEX> to promote <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> research of this
type.  Information technology, or IT, covers areas as
diverse as automatic speech recognition and synthesis,
telephone and other communications engineering,
database management, human-computer
interaction, and indeed computer science itself.
Communication via computer is at the heart of IT.
For instance, a much-used catchword of IT is ‚Äúthe
paperless office‚Äù;  It is supposed to replace all those
filing cabinets and folders with a chip or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> here
and a CD-ROM there.

            It is not much in evidence, however, in the actions
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESPRIT</ENAMEX> itself.  For instance, paperless is emphatically
not the first adjective that springs to mind
to describe the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ESPRIT participant</ENAMEX>.  The
more typical ESPRIT decor is, in fact, wall-to-wall paper--much
of it in curious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euro</ENAMEX>-colours like mauve
and puce.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> has, in the few
decades of its existence, established quite a reputation
for generating paper output on a scale that no
mere national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has ever aspired to: like
every other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euro</ENAMEX>-initiative ever launched, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESPRIT</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">generates Euro</ENAMEX>-text by the ream.  This is rather depressing,
because it suggests that there is no escaping
the remorseless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euro</ENAMEX>-bumf generator even for a
program with an avowed aim of paper reduction.
However, in its own way ESPRIT had indeed made a
small step towards reduction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> paper
mountain.  Perhaps inspired by its own acronym, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESPRIT</ENAMEX>
insists that each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESPRIT</ENAMEX> project, however complex
its title, choose a single-word acronym by
which it may be identified; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ESPRIT</ENAMEX> itself never
refers to projects by their full names, but only by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acronyms</ENAMEX>.

            Whole forests may be saved by this, as ‚ÄúSpeech
Processing and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recognition</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neurocomputing Techniques‚</ENAMEX>Äù turns to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPRINT</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúCorrect Hardware Design Methodology</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Towards</ENAMEX>
Formal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Design</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Verification for Provably Correct</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VLSI Hardware‚</ENAMEX>Äù becomes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHARME</ENAMEX>.  (These are real
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESPRIT</ENAMEX> projects, by the way.  They are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ESPRIT's Basic Reasearch Actions</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BRA</ENAMEX>--a less conspicuous
support system.)

            A study of successful <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">ESPRIT acronyms</ENAMEX> (i.e., the
acronyms of grant applications which proved successful)
suggests certain guidelines.  The ideal acronym
should resemble ESPRIT itself by expressing a
concept with international acceptance.  It should
preferably be <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> in origin, since that may lessen
potential irritation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brussels</ENAMEX> at the fact that the
acronym invariably represents an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word sequence.
So a group which plans to build a Partially
Automated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Restricted-Access Voice Input/Output</ENAMEX>
Network would do well to call it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAR-AVION</ENAMEX>.  Likewise,
a consortium studying <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Algebraic Methods In</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Expert Neural Systems</ENAMEX> might call their projects AMIPENS
(though AMEX would also do quite nicely).

            Just as the right acronym can be the key to a
project's success, so can an ill-chosen acronym lead
to disaster.  Perhaps that is what happened with my
unsuccessful proposal for a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Multiple Entry</ENAMEX> Reconfigurable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dialogue Editor (‚ÄúThis</ENAMEX> project stinks‚Äù--
Referee A), or my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comprehensive Universal</ENAMEX> Labelled
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Database Enumerating System Architecture</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Concepts (‚</ENAMEX>ÄúWill this work lead anywhere?‚Äù).

            In fact the area of acronym selection is so important
that it seems to me there is a technology gap
here.  Moreover, a project to fill it is just what ESPRIT
ought to support.  So I plan to call on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>
throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> to join a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortium</ENAMEX> which will
design and build a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computational Human-Assisted</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Multi-Purpose Acronym Generator/Neologism Evaluator</ENAMEX>.
All we have to do is think up an acronym
for it.

         
         

            The article on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> words [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVIII,1</NUMEX>] prompts
me to ask if anyone knows the etymology of bungee
`springy cord.'  I have always assumed that it must
be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> because of its look, but I have no evidence
of that.  At this moment, the word is most commonly
used for the elastic tether by which daredevils attach
themselves to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> before leaping
off into space, a sport that was graphically depicted
in the opening scene of the movie, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">To Live</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Die in L.A.</ENAMEX>  My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> tells me, however, that
the terms was used at least <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX> for the elastic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cords</ENAMEX> used for tying schoolbooks to the luggage
rack at the back of a bicycle.




         
         
            [ The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozen or so</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> dictionaries
I checked are silent on the origin of bungee;
though The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian National Dictionary</ENAMEX> suggests
that it is related to bungle `<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> rubber; an eraser,'
neither is given an etymology.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bungee</ENAMEX> consists of a
number of strands of rubber bound together in a
tough woven cloth covering.  The term familiar to me
from my sailing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> is Shock <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cord</ENAMEX>, for it is often used
to relieve the strain on a mooring or anchor line.
However, as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levitt</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> pointed out, it is
usually found as a stretchy tie used to bind things up,
as a reefed mainsail on its boom, light articles to a
luggage rack, etc.--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX>.]

            Each time I visit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>, I walk past the Bodleian
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library</ENAMEX>, pass under the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bridge of Sighs</ENAMEX>, and
turn down the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> that leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford University</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New College</ENAMEX>, treading the same path as the
late venerable Reverend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doctor William Archibald</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spooner</ENAMEX>.  In my head and on my tongue, spoonerisms
spring forth.  I recall a childhood favourite from
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s sparse joke repertoire: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúChurch usher to
errant worshiper, `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mardon me padam</ENAMEX>, but you are
occupewing the wrong pie.  May I sew you to another

come to mind that appear <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> in the thoughts
of every dedicated spoonerist: darking bogs, a lanely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lone</ENAMEX>, the lissing mink.  Each of these metatheses
evokes a chuckle of delight.

            The good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spooner</ENAMEX>, a kind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with white
hair and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cherubic</ENAMEX> face, served <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New College</ENAMEX> for a
half <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> as distinguished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> and able <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX>.
He denied having made the slips of the
tongue that made him famous, and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contemporaries</ENAMEX>
agreed that most legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spoonerisms</ENAMEX> were invented
by imaginative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New College</ENAMEX> undergraduates.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Eyewitnesses</ENAMEX> claim, however, that the concept began
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spooner</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</NUMEX>-spoken chapel announcement:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúThe</ENAMEX> next hymn will be `Kinkering Kongs
Their <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Titles Take</ENAMEX>.' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Others</ENAMEX> claim he once actually
said: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äú...in a dark glassly.‚Äù  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> recalled a
discussion in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spooner</ENAMEX> referred several
times to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúDr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friend</ENAMEX>'s child‚Äù when he meant Dr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Childe</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>.  Equally famous (though as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bull</ENAMEX>) is his question of a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> shortly after
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúWas it you or your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> who was
killed in the war?‚Äù

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spooner</ENAMEX> admitted ‚Äúoccasional infelicities in verbal
diction‚Äù but became openly irritated when his
name was associated with oral transpositions.  When
introduced as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúDean of Kew Knowledge‚</ENAMEX>Äù at a
college social function, he responded with outspoken
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">displeasure</ENAMEX>.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the six decades</TIMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spooner</ENAMEX>'s death,
the phenomenon of transposed sounds has found a
firm place both in spoken and written language.  A
spoonerism, or more technically, a methathesis, is the
transposition of letters, syllables, or sounds in a
word or phrase.  More often, they take an oral rather
than a written form.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Writers</ENAMEX> employ them, however,
as a useful comedic device, and accidental faux
pas occasionally appear in printed material.

            Following exhaustive research and practice, I
divide spoonerisms into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> general categories
based upon their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and their function.
Structural categories depend upon changes in the
sound of words or upon their appearance in written
form, particularly the effect upon spelling.  Functional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groupings</ENAMEX> deal with meaning, either overt or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">implied</ENAMEX>, both before and after transposition.  Analysis
of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> enables <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to determine what
might be called <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúgood‚Äù</ENAMEX> as opposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúbad‚Äù spoonerisms</ENAMEX>.
(Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> maintain all are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúbad‚Äù</ENAMEX>.)

            Perfect or true spoonerisms are correct in both
sound and spelling when transposed.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Laborers</ENAMEX> are
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tons</NUMEX> of soil, in place of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> of toil, not only sounds
right and spells right, but has meaning in its revised
form.  The best spoonerisms produce an element of
humor or irony, as this one does.  Sound, spelling,
meaning, and humor all combine to make great
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spoonerisms</ENAMEX>.

            Partial spoonerisms occur when transposition
produces <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> meaningful word.  A treckled
spout in the lake for speckled <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX> is interesting,
perhaps even amusing, but it lacks the satisfaction
and punch of a true spoonerism.  As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> plays the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transposition</ENAMEX> game, many partial spoonerisms come
to mind, but they must be discarded quickly, if you
me what I seen.

            Auditory spoonerisms preserve the right sound
when transposed, but require varied spelling when
written.  Thus, a spoonerized loose-leaf note book
becomes boat nook, not ‚Äúbote nook,‚Äù when written.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spooner</ENAMEX>'s proverbial <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-warmed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-formed
wish has a totally different sound and meaning
if written as ‚Äúhalf-wormed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>,‚Äù requiring the
spelling to be changed.  Since sound and mental image
are the keys to good spoonerisms, auditory types
are most acceptable.

            Visual spoonerisms appear to be correct in written
form, but transposition produces the wrong
sound.  For example, when warm food becomes farm
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wood</ENAMEX>, the result is neither meaningful nor pleasing
to the ear.  Farm does not rhyme with warm, and the
sound of wood differs greatly from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>.  While the
term form wooed has good sound, it loses its effectiveness
because there is no real meaning in the
phrase.  Strictly visual spoonerisms must be rejected.

            Meaningless spoonerisms may be amusing in
sound, but do not create real words.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spooner</ENAMEX>'s original
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinkering Kongs</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Conquering Kings</ENAMEX> falls into
this category along with the comment attributed to
him that the story of the flood was ‚Äúbarrowed from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bobylon</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  His apochryphal statement of compassion
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duff</ENAMEX> and demb brings a smile but creates
no new meaning in the transposed words.  Because
they give great pleasure both to ear and mind, however,
meaningless transpositions are acceptable,
even relished, by all spoonerists.

            Mirror spoonerisms occur when transposition
simply reverses word order, usually with little
change in meaning.  In this phenomenon, the words
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rhyme</ENAMEX>.  Thus, a great date becomes a date great .
Mirror <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> are somewhat rare, seldom have new
meaning, and usually are uninteresting.  I recall a
college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dean</ENAMEX> who was addressed as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean Greene</ENAMEX> to
his face.  Behind his back, however, irreverent junior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">faculty</ENAMEX> referred to him as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green Dean</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spoonerisms</ENAMEX> can be classified on a functional basis
as either useless or useful.  Useless spoonerisms
produce correct words which, unfortunately, neither
amuse not have current meaning.  If a stack of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plates</ENAMEX> is changed to a plaque of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> , the result is, to
say the least, puzzling.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plaque</ENAMEX> is a word, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> is
a word, but no meaning attaches to the term since
there is no mental connection.  Useless spoonerisms
must be avoided and characterize their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creators</ENAMEX> as
rank novices or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">amateurs</ENAMEX>.

            Useful spoonerisms substitute a common or
meaningful phrase for another when transposition
occurs, as when ‚Äúthe movement was dealt a crushing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blow‚Äù</ENAMEX> becomes ‚Äúthe movement was dealt a blushing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crow</ENAMEX> .<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Changing ‚Äúthere</ENAMEX>'s a cozy nook in my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kitchen‚Äù to ‚Äúthere</ENAMEX>'s a nosey cook in my kitchen‚Äù not
only introduces a totally new meaning, but also injects
humor.  Having achieved these desired results,
a sense of satisfaction and well-being settles upon
both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listener</ENAMEX>.

            A gratifying subset of the useful category includes
the obscene spoonerism, either intentional or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accidental</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transposition</ENAMEX> produces a vulgar term or
phrase.  Think what the clever <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spoonerist</ENAMEX> can do
with ‚Äúthe painting is foul art, ‚Äù or perhaps even better,
fowl art .  Could one resist tampering if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce</ENAMEX>
had written ‚ÄúShe was a bit of awful lass, ‚Äù or if
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> had penned ‚ÄúThy chatter is but
showful wit! <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äù  Obscene spoonerisms</ENAMEX> represent the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pinnacle</ENAMEX> of spooner-type wit (or is that wooner-type
spit? ).

            Making up spoonerisms is a pleasant form of addiction.
The malady is similar to that of the clever
little tune that becomes imbedded in the mind and
demands to be hummed: the more one tries to forget,
the stronger is the sense of impulsive and involuntary
recall.  Unlike other life-long addictions,
however, the spoonerist incurs no cost, inflicts little
pain upon others, and can engage in his or her passion
anywhere at any time, greatly enriching the
quality of life.  No one ever recovers, but under the
circumstances, who wants to?  As I often say: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúTo</ENAMEX>
spooner not to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">spoon?‚</ENAMEX>Äù

            I'll probably try dying!
         
         
            Meanwhile, Back at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ranch</ENAMEX> ...



            After bragging about his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> granddaughters, a
rancher <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine said of his prolific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>,
‚ÄúAnd of course he's got that little ketch-colt in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  A bit later at the same picnic when the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">son</ENAMEX>'s pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> joined us with a mess of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX> she had cooked, she too talked about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>,
including the blond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby daughter</ENAMEX> she carried on
her hip.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúPeople</ENAMEX> ask me how come she's so blond
when the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are so dark,‚Äù the young mother
said, laughing, ‚Äúbut that's just the way it turned out.
I told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX>, I said, `<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Honey</ENAMEX>, honest, I didn't jump the
fence.' ‚Äù  Most of us with our <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> had just
come down off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mesa</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX> had been branding
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">calves</ENAMEX>.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch</ENAMEX> lingo branding often implies
vaccination, castration, and ear-marking as well.  So
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rancher</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> yelled, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúWhat</ENAMEX> did y'all do with
those mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">oysters</ENAMEX> I fried up<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">?‚</NUMEX>Äù

            ‚ÄúThe what?‚Äù the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady visitor</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheffield</ENAMEX> inquired.

            ‚ÄúThe huevos... You know, the balls,‚Äù the hungry
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> interpreted, giving up her attempt
at delicacy.

            I lived on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">my formative years</TIMEX>, and the
terms, the jargon, at least in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>, is not unfamiliar to me.  But I am
aware that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockmen</ENAMEX>'s vocabulary varies considerably
around the English-speaking world, much more I
imagine than, say, nautical, or culinary, or musical
terms do.  Once while my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and I were spending
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks</TIMEX> on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>, we
left our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in the care of a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> who had just been fired for
marrying an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> without Departmental
permission.  Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>,
phoned me at home then and was answered by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX>.  ‚ÄúBill isn't here,‚Äù she said<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">; ‚Äúhe</ENAMEX>'s on
a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  Now, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> was
quite angry over the firing of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, and probably
she was being deliberately un-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> on the
phone to confound yet another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stupid Yank</ENAMEX>.  If so,
she succeeded, as my <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> later told me,
and, more interestingly to me, revealed by example
how much terms in the same language for the same
things ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, sticks ) in the
same occupation can vary from place to place, at
least when it comes to stock raising.

            ‚ÄúMost of what you've just seen goes on in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UK</ENAMEX> too,‚Äù I remarked to our <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> as we
drove down off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mesa</ENAMEX>, to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheffield rejoined, ‚ÄúOh</ENAMEX>, no, I don't think so.  I think
we mark <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> with little tags in their ears.  We
don't rope the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">calves</ENAMEX> either and throw them down.‚Äù
On <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> thought, I had to agree that she was
probably right.  But the most repugnant part of the
multiple operation we had just witnessed was the
castration, and I remained sure that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bull calves</ENAMEX> are
made steer <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">calves</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> and are vaccinated.  I
wondered whether on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> the common
word for castrate was the same as here: cut .  Presumably
the other terms we had heard in use on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mesa</ENAMEX>, flank for `heave the roped calf onto the
ground' and hogtie for `truss it up with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pickin</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">string</ENAMEX> ' while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">well-trained roping horse</ENAMEX> keeps the
ketch rope taut, are not used, as the practices are
not, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>.  In fact, on many, if not most, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
ranches nowadays all of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> are
performed in chutes rather than by roping <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">calves</ENAMEX>
from horseback and flanking and hogtying them.
Also, increasingly brands are painlessly frozen, not
burned, into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">calves</ENAMEX>' hide.  Even in the relatively
primitive procedure we had witnessed, though, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX>
had been so brisk and deft and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">calves</ENAMEX> so nonchalant
as soon as they got back on their feet that the
business had not seemed so atrocious as one might
think.

            Here in the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">States</ENAMEX>, just as worldwide,
ranch terminology varies from area to area.  Everywhere
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> ranch <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">vocabulary</ENAMEX> has
drawn heavily from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican Spanish</ENAMEX>, since the industry
largely evolved in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and the border
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>.  But even though as a boy I
lived on a ranch right on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> border, I remember
being mystified by ranching terms that
crept into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> songs from north of us, cayuse,
for example.  I wondered about the word coulee in
the old song: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äú...they feed in the coulees and water
in the draws...‚Äù

            Ranch words of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> origin, besides ranch
itself, are: rodeo, latigo `a long strap to fasten the
cinch to a Western saddle,' corral (a word I could
not find in an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">dictionary</ENAMEX>, except in its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afrikaans</ENAMEX>
form kraal, when I needed to know how to
spell it some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty years ago</TIMEX>), bronc(o), palomino,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">buckeroo</ENAMEX> (which I have heard used only in fun), and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chaps</ENAMEX>, to list a few that come to mind.  But most
ranching terms, including such essential ones as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cowboy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX>, pasture, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fence</ENAMEX>, heifer, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX>, boots, saddle,
and so on, are obviously common <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> words
of long standing.  Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> words have
taken on a special application in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ranching</ENAMEX> usage.
Take the verb cut, which in common ranch parlance
has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> meanings, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> as stated above being
`castrate.'  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> meaning, not exclusive to
ranch talk, is `separate,' as in ‚ÄúCut the deck (of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cards</ENAMEX>).‚Äù  On a ranch you might hear someone say,
‚ÄúToday we've got to cut those penned steers,‚Äù
meaning perhaps `separate out the ones to be
shipped.'  A cutting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> is a mount trained to separate
certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> out from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herd</ENAMEX> or bunch.

            What on most <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranches</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> is called
a ketch (catch) rope is a reata in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican Spanish</ENAMEX>.
Our word lariat comes from this <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> word with
the definite article prefixed and the final vowel
dropped.  In the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, especially
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX>, these ropes used to lasso <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> from on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">horseback</ENAMEX> sometimes are--or anyway were--
woven of strands of rawhide, which is elastic.  If a
big calf or steer was roped with one of these rawhide
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lariats</ENAMEX> attached solidly to the saddle horn, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
style, and the roping <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> came to an abrupt halt or
sat back so that the roped <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> hit the rope at a
run, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lasso</ENAMEX> tended to stretch like a rubber band
and then snap, possibly springing back to knock an
eye out of the cowboy.  Monolongual <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> vaqueros
witnessing the folly of such misuse of their implement
would shout at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gringos</ENAMEX> in excellent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desert Latin</ENAMEX> (as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> has been called): <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúDale,</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dale!‚Äù  Literally</ENAMEX> this means simply `Give to him' but
actually the advice offered was more like ‚ÄúPlay him
(like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>).‚Äù  The idea was that you had to hold the
rope in your hand and reduce the tension to what
the elasticity would tolerate.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cowboys</ENAMEX>,
perhaps confusing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dale</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
dally, began to understand, maybe at the cost of an
eye or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, and in their own lingo called the rawhide
lariats dally ropes .  That, at least, was the etymology
current in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Arizona</ENAMEX>, which was
plausible enough to convince me.  I have heard
other explanations of dally rope in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> that
were too implausible to remember.

            Another interesting word that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> cowhands
have taken from their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX>,
along with the thing itself, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chaps</ENAMEX>, typically truncated
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> chaparreras, the word for
protective leather leggings worn mainly by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cowboys</ENAMEX>
on horseback in thorny brush.  The only time I have
heard the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> word pronounced with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">usual English</ENAMEX>, or for that matter <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, ch sound
was in a perfume ad on TV.  By the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who wear
chaps the article is invariably called as if spelled
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shaps</ENAMEX> .  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguistic forces</ENAMEX> have shaped this word:
the English-language tendency to reduce words to a
single syllable (e.g., pram, sync, perk, Miss/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ms.</ENAMEX>, etc.)
and the law of open syllables that causes the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> consonants that come together in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>
word to be dropped, most commonly in the case of
ll, which prescriptively should be pronounced as ly
but is much more often pronounced as y alone.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> element of the tsh combination represented by ch
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, is not so commonly skipped
as the first l of the double l combination, but it is
often dropped, at least in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>; so what
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gringo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cowboys</ENAMEX> heard was shaparreras, which
they trimmed down to what was spelled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chaps</ENAMEX> but
pronounced shaps .

            Drawing on occupational jargon for metaphors
to enliven communication is a common way to color
and illustrate language.  And where a basic occupation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">livestock</ENAMEX>, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Biblical Judea</ENAMEX> or parts
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American West</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stockman</ENAMEX>'s jargon is bound to be a main source of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metaphors</ENAMEX>, whether the subject be marital transgression
as in the banter at our picnic, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord</ENAMEX>'s
providing for His flock as in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-third</NUMEX> Psalm,
or national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> as in ‚ÄúWaltzing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matilda</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
         
         
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of English Place-Names</ENAMEX>
            Place-names have many different ‚Äúmeanings.‚Äù
We could all write down a list of names which are
personally meaningful, recalling places where we
have lived and loved.  If ever I write an autobiography
it will be in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dictionary form</ENAMEX>: names of places and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> defined in terms of private significance.  For
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">poets</ENAMEX>, humorists, and those blessed with fertile
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">imagination</ENAMEX>, place-names can have other meanings:


Yes, I remember <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adlestrop</ENAMEX>
--The name, because <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one afternoon</TIMEX>
Of heat the express-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> drew up there
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unwontedly</ENAMEX>.  It was late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>.

            

            Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Thomas</ENAMEX> begins the poem which enables
us to join him in his railway compartment at
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">turn of the century</TIMEX>.  He goes on to fix that summer
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> and the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adlestrop</ENAMEX> forever in
our consciousness.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poets</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Vincent Ben√</ENAMEX>©t
reminded us, can fall in love with place-names.

            Humorists respond to them differently.  I hope
everyone is familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Meaning of Liff</ENAMEX>, by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Adams</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lloyd</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>).  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
decided that place-names spent too much time
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äúloafing</ENAMEX> about on signposts.‚Äù  They assigned definitions
to the names which allowed them to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äústart
earning their keep in everyday conversation.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Adlestrop</ENAMEX>,
to them, was ‚Äúthat part of a suitcase which is
designed to get snarled up on conveyor belts at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX>.
Some of the more modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Adlestrop</ENAMEX> designs
have a special `quick release' feature which enables
the case to fly open at this point and fling your underclothes
into the conveyor belt's gearing mechanism.‚Äù

            Reluctantly I have to admit that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> has
no right to expect poetry or wit in this latest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>
place-name dictionary.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> is a highly reputable
academic toponymist, and he is dealing with
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>, place-names.  Those who
study New World place-naming are at a distinct advantage.
They are mainly social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX>, with
many an anecdote to relate about why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe</ENAMEX> transferred existing names.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scholars</ENAMEX> like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.D. Mills</ENAMEX> have to shift back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several centuries</TIMEX> and
be linguistic archaeologists.  They then have the difficult
job of explaining the results of their researches
to laymen.

            What, then, has <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX> made of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Adlestrop</ENAMEX>?  For
him it is a place in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gloucestershire</ENAMEX> which had its
name recorded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">714</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Titlestrop</ENAMEX> .  By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domesday</ENAMEX>,
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1086</TIMEX>, it had become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tedestrop</ENAMEX> .  He therefore explains
the name as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúoutlying farmstead</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hamlet</ENAMEX> of
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> called *<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T√¶tel.</ENAMEX>‚Äù  In other words, as he says, it
is an OE personal name plus the element throp .  He
adds: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúThe initial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX> disappeared from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>
due to confusion with the preposition at .‚Äù

            I think we should consider for a moment to
whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX> is explaining all this.  I imagine that it is
likely to be someone who happens to live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Adlestrop</ENAMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chap</ENAMEX> who has woken up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> and said to
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">himself: ‚ÄúAdlestrop</ENAMEX>--that's a queer sort of name.
Why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adlestrop</ENAMEX>?‚Äù  Having popped into his local reference
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> and taken this dictionary from the
shelf, has all become clear to him?  Is this entry as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúclear</ENAMEX> and concise‚Äù as the blurb claims?

            If our enquirer had at least some formal training
in philology, it will have been crystal clear.  He will
have had no need to consult the Introduction to discover
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T√¶tel</ENAMEX>'s name is preceded by *because it
is ‚Äúinferred from comparative [place-name] evidence
and postulated to occur.‚Äù  He will not have needed
to consult the list of abbreviations to learn that OE
stands for Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, and that ‚Äúold‚Äù in that context
has a fairly specific meaning.  He will have understood
why the at confusion occurred.  Though he
would probably talk of living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Adlestrop</ENAMEX> he knows
that that he gets off the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adlestrop</ENAMEX>.  Not that
he would think in such simplistic terms: his historical
knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prepositional</ENAMEX> usage would have
made such reasoning unnecessary.

            My point is that a more normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> will have
extracted far less from the entry--probably no more
than that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adlestrop</ENAMEX> originally meant `someone's
farm.'  My further point is that to be totally successful,
a dictionary of this kind requires far more than
the academic skills of a place-name <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX>.  If
such a work is really to do its job--tell the story of a
place-name in simple terms to an average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>--a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX> deal of further thinking needs to be done by
the editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> about how the information is presented
and for whom.  Imagination on their part is
required, even if it is not the imagination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>
or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humorist</ENAMEX>.

            The information in this book would have been
better presented in an entirely different form.  Had
it remained a traditional book, there would have
been a strong case for listing separately the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX>
of names that consist of a personal name and
common place-name element.  Various other lists
could have given the essential information about
names based on words with meanings such as ford
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> .  An index would have allowed names to
be traced in alphabetical order.  Separate articles
could have dealt with the meaning of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">throp</ENAMEX> and such matters as the loss of initial letters,
owing to confusion of preposition and name.

            A much better solution, however, would have
been to publish this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> as computer software.
Surely the reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> to which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> turn
for such specialized information as the origin of
place-names, as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who are interested
enough in such subjects to buy dictionaries,
have access by now to personal computers?  I should
have been able to refer to the fruits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mills</ENAMEX>'s labors
by inserting a floppy disk into my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">machine</ENAMEX>.  On typing
Adlestrop I should have been presented with the
early spellings and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX>'s interpretation.  Had I
needed it, a Help key should have brought an instant
explanation of the symbol * and the abbreviation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OE</ENAMEX>.  There would have been a far fuller discussion of
the preposition question in a separate paragraph,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that would have appeared on screen had I typed
in a name, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elstree</ENAMEX> , where it was also relevant.

            Academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> of this dictionary will, as
usual, write a great deal about whether the author
was right to choose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> postulated form of an Old
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX> name rather than a slightly different one.  I
believe it would be wrong to confine the discussion
to such matters.  I am prepared to trust <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX>'s scholarship
and accept that he has explained to the best of
his ability <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 12,000</NUMEX> names.  He has conscientiously
done his job.  His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>, in my view, have
not.  They have complacently chosen to update and
marginally simplify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eilert Ekwall</ENAMEX>'s previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of English Place-Names</ENAMEX> .  I see very little
evidence that they stopped to think who would be
interested in this specialized information, and how it
could best be presented.

            This is all the more disappointing since other
sections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OUP</ENAMEX>, along with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> of reference
works, have made great strides forward in
recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.  Academic excellence has been maintained,
but combined with good design, editorial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flair</ENAMEX>, and original thinking.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of this book
had an important part to play.  Unfortunately, both
for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX> and his average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>, they appear to
have completely missed their opportunity.

Analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Spoken and Written Texts</ENAMEX>
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1960s</TIMEX> I wrote an article [WORD,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXVI</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>), Nos. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, an offprint of which I shall
be happy to send to those requesting it] in which I
suggested that relatively accurate statistics on word
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequencies</ENAMEX> could best be attained by factoring in
the circulation and listenership figures of periodicals
and radio/TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> used as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of data about
the words and phrases under investigation.  While it
is acknowledged that such a method would not work
well for books, the idea was that the number of occurrencies
of a lemma (a technical though convenient
term for the `thing--word or phrase--under
study'), multiplied by, say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audit Bureau of Circulation</ENAMEX>
sworn circulation of a periodical would
yield a figure that could legitimately be called its
Exposure .  Obviously, such a number would be far
too large to manipulate readily, so, using a formula
familiar to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statisticians</ENAMEX>, it was normalized to produce
a simple decimal number of only a few digits which I
called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lemma</ENAMEX>'s Exposure Index .  The purpose of
the exercise was to connect the frequency information
with the language as it is used and perceived; in
addition, the approach would serve to eliminate
from consideration those materials which, though
published, were little read, with a consequent low
influence on the lexicon.

            Frequency information on the language, of
great usefulness to lexicographers and other linguists
is sorely lacking: a study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thorndike</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lorge</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> yielded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teacher</ENAMEX>'s Wordbook
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Words</ENAMEX> , but that had outlived its accuracy
and usefulness by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid 1940s</TIMEX>.  With the emergence
of computer typesetting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, it
seemed likely that the analysis of large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> of text
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">periodicals</ENAMEX> (in particular)
would be facilitated, for one of the greatest expenses
was the cost of keyboarding the texts into machine-readable
form so that they could be processed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">speedily</ENAMEX> and economically by computer.

            Those who question why a large corpus of material
should be needed for study ought to realize that
the amount of language written and read, uttered
and heard in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a single day</TIMEX> is unbelievably huge.  In a
given <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX>, the numbers of words spewed forth by
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AM</ENAMEX> and FM radio
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stations</ENAMEX> alone is unimaginable.  While it is acknowledged
that statistics can make allowance for using
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> instead of an entire corpus for analysis, the
prodigious quantity of lemmata (that's the plural of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lemma</ENAMEX> ) requires an incredibly large sample.  Then
again, the statistics for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few thousand</NUMEX> of the most
frequent words-- the<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">, a</ENAMEX>, an, but, for<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">, of</ENAMEX>, etc.--need
not be derived again and again, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few thousand</NUMEX>
such lemmata are usually eliminated at the outset.
Still, that means that a reasonably accurate sample,
as I suggested in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX>, would have to contain a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion</NUMEX>--preferably,
a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion billion</NUMEX>--lemmata.  In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX>, computer storage and processing equipment
were too primitive to accommodate such quantities.
But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, the situation is quite different.
Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> generally less reluctant
than before to make available to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> the
disks and tapes containing text.

            As we all know, there is an enormous number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications</ENAMEX> dealing with highly specialized areas.  If
a truly <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúunabridged‚Äù</ENAMEX> word study of the language
were ever to be undertaken, such materials would
have to be included.  But for practical purposes,
there is little point in including a lemma like hwƒÅlrƒÅd
(a kenning, `<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whale</ENAMEX>-road,' for sea ) if only an infinitesimal
portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> reads <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beowulf</ENAMEX> or
an article about it in a recondite learned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>.

            Early in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Funk & Wagnalls</ENAMEX> published
dictionaries that contained a large number of
Scotticisms, either out of habit or affection for the
genre or because their lexicographers felt that every
student who read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burns</ENAMEX> had to be able to find in the
dictionary every word he used.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX>, when all
editions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burns</ENAMEX>'s poems are annotated, with
glosses for any ‚Äúforeign‚Äù words, allowing such Scotticisms
to occupy valuable space in general dictionaries
is not considered economical, and only those
likely to appear in crossword puzzles are included.
Similarly, historical lexicography--the vocabulary
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chaucer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Rolle</ENAMEX> of
Hampole, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holinshed Chronicle</ENAMEX>, etc.--has been
relegated to footnotes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> editions or to specialized
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionaries</ENAMEX>.  Of course, not all Scotticisms
have been excised, and words like auld, land , and
syne are probably still to be found in many dictionaries,
but only because they are frequent.  But these
words are archaisms, obsolete words that are used
for special effect or other reasons, as in popular quotations,
like wherefore in ‚ÄúWherefore art thou,
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Romeo?</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù</ENAMEX> known to every schoolchild (and misunderstood
by many, who think it means `where,'
while it really means `why': it is retained in what for ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dialectal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whuffo</ENAMEX> ').  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Bible</ENAMEX>, which contains
many such archaisms, has preserved them for
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">modern English</ENAMEX>; wherefore more commonly appears
in the tautology whys and wherefores .

            The book under review might well have included
something on the subject of exposure in one
of the essays collected within its pages, for much of
the material selected by lexicographers as source
corpora for citations is arrived at subjectively and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">impressionistically</ENAMEX>--though I hasten to allow that
the subjective and impressionistic maunderings of a
good, experienced linguist might well be worth a
motherlode of statistics.  The point is that Reception
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Response</ENAMEX> is one of the few works that I have
seen that tries to present a point of view from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX> of the receiver of information, while
paying attention to the semiotic aspects of language
(that is, the elements embedded in communication
that are not strictly concerned with language,
per se).

            The twelve articles collected under the general
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rubrics of Contexts</ENAMEX> of responsiveness, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Listener</ENAMEX> response
and communication, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Responsive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>
have mixed success in dealing with the subject.  The
first, ‚ÄúAttending the hearing: listening in legal settings,‚Äù
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peter Goodrich</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lecturer</ENAMEX> in law, does
not seem to come to grips with its subject--at least
in an understandable way--till more than halfway
through, notwithstanding its inclusion of much matter
that makes good and interesting reading.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. Tedeschi</ENAMEX>'s ‚ÄúTherapeutic listening‚Äù is a broad,
though concise treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychotherapists</ENAMEX>' reaction
and receptivity to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.  It is more an
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> on the behaviour of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">therapists</ENAMEX> than on language,
so we can leave it.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deborah Cameron</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deborah Hills (‚Äú</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Listening in</ENAMEX>': negotiating relationships
between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presenters</ENAMEX> on radio
phone-in programmes‚Äù) have studied the output of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBC Radio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>'s ‚Äúall-talk‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, which I
have listened to with interest.  After devoting (wasting?)
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> their space on a penetrating analysis
of how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presenters</ENAMEX> say hello and goodbye
(or not, as is often the case with goodbyes), they
finally get down to the substance of the calls.  In a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subcategory</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúExtreme</ENAMEX>, outrageous and offensive
calls,‚Äù the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> refer to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúa new genre of
phone-ins [in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>] whose whole raison <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">d'√™tre</ENAMEX> is
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presenter</ENAMEX> to pour abuse on those who call.‚Äù
Those who have heard <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Grant</ENAMEX> and others in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> are familiar with the pattern.  What the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
fail to mention is that the treatment the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> receives
sometimes depends on who the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presenter</ENAMEX> is.

            For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Allen</ENAMEX> (on LBC) is low-key,
calm, and always gracious and polite, seeming to
evoke no outrageous calls.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robbie Vinson</ENAMEX> [sp?], who
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">runs Robbie Vinson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Night Line</ENAMEX> and refers to himself
in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, is often very unpleasant indeed,
and some of the conversations cited in the article
(especially <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in which a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> was told that if he
didn't like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> he should get out) smack strongly
of his acerbic, dyspeptic, often rude manner.  What
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presenters</ENAMEX> are missing is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX> often tune in
to hear all sorts of the things that other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX>
have to say, whether they agree with them or think
them mad, and it makes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presenter</ENAMEX> appear intolerantly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bigoted</ENAMEX> to cut off a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> whose opinions are
at variance with those the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presenter</ENAMEX> might perceive
to be held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clapham</ENAMEX> omnibus.  On
the whole, despite the preliminary screening that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> are subjected to, mainly in order to eliminate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cranks</ENAMEX>, drunks, and undesirables, those who do get
through rarely have anything of moment to contribute,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presenters</ENAMEX> are notably unsympathetic in
eliciting a fair exposure of their comments, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">listener</ENAMEX> is (too) often left with the feeling that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">presenter</ENAMEX> has been too dismissive.  The analysis in
this article is interesting and well done, but I question
whether it is an analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listener</ENAMEX>, as only
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presenter</ENAMEX> are discussed.  To consider
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listener</ENAMEX> in this structure would be a
mistake; as far as I can see, the comment on listeners
is confined to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>' ‚ÄúConclusion‚Äù:


Radio phone-ins are speech events in which relationships
between individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX>, a notion
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúlistening public‚Äù</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> as personified
in the professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presenter</ENAMEX> are carefully
negotiated.

            

            I do not accept that, for once the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listener</ENAMEX> has
become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> he is as much a part of the script,
entertainment--whatever one might call it--as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">presenter</ENAMEX> and is, in effect, no longer a mere <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listener</ENAMEX>.
That is confirmed in the following:


Although it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presenter</ENAMEX> who has ultimate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> in the encounter--a control he may legitimate
in terms of the interests of the ‚Äúlisteners
out there,‚Äù their right to be entertained and to
be protected from offensive views--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX>
who call in may challenge the norms he lays
down in various ways, from dogged pursuit of a
‚Äúpersonal relationship‚Äù with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presenter</ENAMEX> to
equally dogged resistance to the ‚Äúcontainment
strategies‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presenters</ENAMEX> employ.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Listeners</ENAMEX>, like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">presenters</ENAMEX>, are aware of the linguistic and social
norms which structure acceptable phone-in talk;
yet they are capable of ignoring or subverting
these and of attempting to renegotiate the rules
of the game.

            

            Lack of space precludes further comment on
this interesting collection of papers, but I should like
to add <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> observations.  The phone-in programs
have created a culture language of their own, one
that is, curiously, common to both the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>.  It includes comments like I'm a first-time (or
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">virgin</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX>, I really enjoy your program (which alternates
with You really have a great program <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX>) ,
and Thank you for taking my call .  I have
never fathomed the purpose of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>; the second
is pure sycophancy; and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> is patently ludicrous,
for if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presenter</ENAMEX> of a phone-in program refused
calls it would not be a phone-in program.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Press</ENAMEX> has seen fit to
honor the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">200th</NUMEX> anniversary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boswell's Life of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX> with a collection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> essays on the

be delighted that there has been such widespread
enthusiasm for the field they have ploughed for the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past six decades</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Daiches</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edinburgh</ENAMEX>
leads off with a splendid introduction on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boswell</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ambiguities</ENAMEX>, writing about the biography that
‚Äúthe subject understood the biographer more profoundly
than the biographer understood the subject.‚Äù
True enough, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s intellectual capacity
was greater than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boswell's ab</ENAMEX> initio .  The
remaining essays are organized into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
general essays on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boswell</ENAMEX> and eighteenth<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> culture, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> essays on contexts for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> essays on features of the biography
itself.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Crawford</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aberdeen</ENAMEX>) analyzes the

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erskine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Johnston</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William Temple</ENAMEX>, a
useful way to demonstrate how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boswell</ENAMEX> developed
his literary skills.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Sher</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Jersey Institute</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technology</ENAMEX>) probes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boswell</ENAMEX>'s relations with
both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moderate and Popular</ENAMEX> wings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boswell</ENAMEX>'s ambiguities and internal contrarieties
are neatly shown in his treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robertson</ENAMEX>, Principal of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edinburgh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>,

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">theology</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Rogers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of South Florida</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">provides Boswell</ENAMEX>'s attitude to and use of Scotticisms
both in writing and in speech; at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time, we are
told, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boswell</ENAMEX> considered compiling a dictionary of
words peculiar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> tongue.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Pittock</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aberdeen</ENAMEX>) undertakes the important task of evaluating
Boswell as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX>.  She points out that had he
lived in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX> he would have excelled as an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interviewer</ENAMEX>, much like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Frost</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boswell</ENAMEX> wrote a considerable volume of published
work before he began the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life of Johnson</ENAMEX> , preliminary
trials of strength.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Curley</ENAMEX> (Bridgewater
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State College</ENAMEX>) uses his Account of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corsica</ENAMEX> as

through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> .  It is also a tract on political
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liberty</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curley</ENAMEX> quotes the epigraph from the

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manning</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newnham, Cantab</ENAMEX>.) deals with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boswell</ENAMEX>'s
episodes of melancholia, a trait he shared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>,
and his essays on it in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Hypochondriack</ENAMEX> .

            The above essays set the stage for essays dealing
directly with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX> .  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of these is an outstanding
account of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boswell</ENAMEX>'s treatment of the famous
quarrel between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chesterfield</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Burke</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama</ENAMEX>) reviews and analyzes
other contemporary accounts and finds that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boswell</ENAMEX>'s
is not only the most accurate but that he uses
it to demonstrate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>, whereas others
were merely retailing literary gossip.  Marlies
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Danziger</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hunter</ENAMEX>) takes up the question of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boswell</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">authorial</ENAMEX> comments that are interspersed
throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX> .  Certainly he intrudes himself
into the scenes, sometimes for sheer self-display, but
also for a variety of other purposes, all of which are
carefully examined.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Korshin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>)
supplies a masterly analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s conversation
as recorded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boswell</ENAMEX>, sometimes a bit long
after the fact.  It may be true that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boswell</ENAMEX>'s formal,
highly generalized diction, quite possibly encouraged
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malone</ENAMEX>, is no longer to our taste, that is, not
the diction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twentieth-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biographers</ENAMEX>; but if
so, so much the worse for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of
biography.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donna Heiland</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vassar</ENAMEX>) comments on
other contemporary biographies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>.  She
comments that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boswell</ENAMEX> presents <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> as a divine
figure with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boswell</ENAMEX> as his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX>.  ‚ÄúThe paradox inherent
in the concept of divinity incarnate is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitome</ENAMEX>... of the dichotomy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boswell</ENAMEX>'s portrayal
of his subject.  Boswell reveres <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>, and at the
same time manipulates him continually.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Greg</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clingham</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fordham</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, modestly places his
essay last.  He attacks the complex question of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚Äútruth‚Äù vs.  ‚Äúauthenticity‚Äù</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boswell</ENAMEX>'s portrait of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>, and therein lies the art of biography.

            This is an exceptionally fine collection of scholarly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">essays</ENAMEX>, greatly to be valued by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> interested
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boswell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>.  Though some of the
most opaque prose written today is by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ph.D.s</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English Lit.</ENAMEX>, these essays are largely free of that
fault.  Perhaps their clarity owes something to their
subject.  Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boswell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> wrote readable
and lucid prose, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> who gloss their texts
cannot resist their influence, which is all for the
good.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> have, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> advised
Boswell, rid their minds of cant.

            Of that ilk, or kidney



            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent decades</TIMEX> an ilk epidemic has afflicted
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broadcasters</ENAMEX> and ordinary people
who like to fancy-up their language a bit.  For instance,
this from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Landers</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>, Dear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbey</ENAMEX>, and several
others of their ilk...

            

            Here is Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Fraser</ENAMEX> in his revision of Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gowers</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Complete Plain Words:</ENAMEX>

               
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ilk</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Scots</ENAMEX> word meaning `same.'  It is not a
noun meaning `kind, sort, kidney.'  ‚ÄúJames Sporran
of that ilk‚Äù means `<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Sporran</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sporran</ENAMEX>';
it shows that he lives on the estate that bears the
family name and distinguishes him from his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousins</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sporrans of Glenhaggis</ENAMEX>, and his distant
kinsmen, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sporrans</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper Tooting</ENAMEX>.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolmaster</ENAMEX> who wrote to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Times</ENAMEX> about the
damage done by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> by ‚ÄúMrs. Whitehouse
and her ilk‚Äù should write out fifty times, ‚ÄúI must
not use words I do not understand.‚Äù

            

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1934</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third Edition of the Concise Oxford</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> endorsed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scots</ENAMEX> usage but reported
that ilk is used vulgarly for ‚Äúthat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>,
class, or set.<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äù  The Eighth Edition</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>) gives this
as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> definition for ilk:

               
colloquial, disputed use a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, class, or set
(not of the same ilk as you).  Usually derogatory,
and therefore best avoided.

            

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> definition, which I need not quote here,
is a quite inadequate one for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> use of the
word.  Surprisingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers 20th Century Dictionary</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edited</ENAMEX> and published in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edinburg</ENAMEX>, displays the
same insensitivity, as does the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gage Canadian</ENAMEX>.
However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX> is quite responsive
to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> sensitivity.

            Having had this say on ilk , I am giving up the
fight.  I will not use the word in the now popular
sense, but I will refrain from snarling at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who
do.  I remember, though, that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years ago</TIMEX> the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great Fowler</ENAMEX> declared that the non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scots</ENAMEX> use of ilk is
merely an example of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Worn-out Humour</ENAMEX>.

            However, when the noun is used adjectivally it
can mean `each' or `every': Ilka lassie <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ha</NUMEX>' here laddi.
But if you were not born and raised in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX> you
should not fool with that one: I was not and I do not.

            Perhaps it would be better, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fraser</ENAMEX> seems to
suggest, to use the phrase of that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kidney</ENAMEX>.  Apparently,
this use of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kidney</ENAMEX> came from the belief that
the kidneys were a factor in determining a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperament</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> had that in mind in The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Merry Wives</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windsor</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of my kidney.‚Äù
And both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fielding</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Disraeli</ENAMEX> used the word that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> in their novels.  Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concise Oxford</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s New World give as one of the meanings of
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kidney ‚Äútemperament‚Äù</ENAMEX> and ‚Äúkind, sort.‚Äù  There
seems a touch of worn-out humor in that--or perhaps
merely of verbal cuteness.

         
         
            Beyond Compare



            In the usual meanings of positives, comparatives,
and superlatives of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> adjectives the gradations
are taken to mean ‚Äú--,<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äù ‚Äú-er/</ENAMEX>more --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">,‚Äù</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äú-est/</ENAMEX>most --,‚Äù the latter being the adverbs normally
used to distinguish the comparatives and
superlatives of polysyllabic words.  Despite the fact
that it is awkward to describe, there is nothing terrifyingly
profound about this observation: all it means
is that hot means `hot,' hotter means `more hot, of a
higher temperature than that designated by hot ,'
and hottest means `most hot, of a temperature that is
greater than that of anything else being considered.'
For polysyllables, like ignorant, we use more ignorant
and most ignorant .

            
               What is interesting is that the semantic pattern
does not hold for old and older when applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>:
it seems that an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is older than an older
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, or, to put it the other way round, an older
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is younger than an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>.  Old in this
context is more or less synonymous with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX>,
which means `quite advanced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>,' while older
means `advanced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> (but not yet so advanced as
to be called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúold‚Äù</ENAMEX>).'  ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oldest</ENAMEX> does not enter this discussion.)
I venture to suggest that the reason is that
while an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is merely `old,' an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is
perceived as being older than a younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> (often
the one who is talking) rather than being older
than an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>.  Clear?  I thought not.

            Which is younger, a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> or a younger
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>?  Perhaps young/younger are not used in the
same way.  How old are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúyoung people‚Äù</ENAMEX>?

            The same sort of thing seems to be going on
with low-class, which is `lower' than lower-class, and
with high-class, which is `higher' than higher-class.
The dictionaries I have checked are silent--improperly
so, I think--on these senses.

            Are there other similar anomalies in the language?

         
         
            Everything I Know



            Occasionally, one hears, She taught him everything
he knows or He taught her everything she
knows, curious expressions when you come to think
about them; indeed, they state an impossible condition.
On the other hand, She taught him everything
she knows and He taught her everything he knows,
though improbable, could make sense.  The ambiguity
probably arose from She/He taught her/him everything
she/he knows (about something specified),
in which the referent of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> She/he is ambiguous:
common sense dictates that it refer to the subject
of the sentence, not to the her or him, thus
yielding the more reasonable She taught him everything
she knows or He taught her everything she
knows .

         
         


            When error or conjecture is uncritically copied
from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> to another, it is often legislated
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">into ‚Äúfact‚Äù</ENAMEX> merely by virtue of having been repeated
so often.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> word bistro/bistrot, for
example, has countless times been attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>,
although that is mere fantasy.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Creating ‚Äúfact‚Äù</ENAMEX> merely by repeating error is
particularly frequent when it comes to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>: numerous times we read, without supporting
proof, that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> words like copacetic, derma
(the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>), kibosh (as in put the kibosh on ), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cockamamie</ENAMEX>,
gazump, gnof or (older <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>) gnoffe, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> (the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, not the rope), and shyster are from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>.
Indeed, proof is impossible in such cases, for the
words were not derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>.

            Having recently exploded the myth about the
supposed <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> origin of several of these words in
articles in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish Linguistic Studies</ENAMEX>, I turned my attention
to gunsel, in its various spellings.  After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> of working on nothing but this word and
thinking that every treatment of it in dictionaries
and elsewhere had been located and evaluated, I
sent the article to press.  Now, to my dismay, Muriel
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> writes in VERBATIM [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVIII,2,23</NUMEX>] that ‚Äúthe suggested
definition [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ] is from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> genzel, gantzel
and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> G√§nslein, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G√</ENAMEX>§nzel `gosling, young
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goose</ENAMEX>.' ‚Äù

            Let the record be set straight: <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> has only
gendzl `gosling.'  The e stands for the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">phoneme /e/,</ENAMEX>
which in this word is pronounced like the e in ebb in
all varieties of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>.  That vowel would not yield
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> vowel of gunsel, hence a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> origin for it
is doubtful.  Since this <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word has no association
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>, it is not possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> gun
triggered (as some have suggested) an irregular
sound change, resulting in an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vowel</ENAMEX> which
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> one would not otherwise have yielded.

            There is no <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> word ‚Äúgenzel‚Äù or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúgantzel</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> has copied, uncritically,
from others.  If <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> is the source of gunsel, someone
will have to produce an etymon that is phonologically
more likely than gendzl or, if that is indeed
its etymon, explain the irregular sound change.  A
thread running through all these mistaken etymologies
is that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> think that the only criterion
in etymology is ‚Äúif it sounds like x , then it must
be derived from x .‚Äù  That misconception can be seen
on a grand scale in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Mozeson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Word: The</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary That Reveals the Hebrew Source of English</ENAMEX>,
which purports to show that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 22,000</NUMEX> (!)
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words are of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> origin.  That book is so
brimming with error that the title of the review of it
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish Language Studies</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Vol. 2, 1990</TIMEX>, pp. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">105-83</ENAMEX>]
sums it up neatly: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúFiction</ENAMEX> or Medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philology</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúTruth</ENAMEX>'s a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> must to kennel; he must be

            You mention [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVII,3</NUMEX>] the word gunsel as being a
less common, old-fashioned term for `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gunman</ENAMEX>,' etc.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dashiell Hammett</ENAMEX> managed to slip the word into The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Maltese Falcon</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alfred A. Knopf</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 367</ENAMEX>], without
explaining that it meant `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual</ENAMEX>'; he was,
not unnaturally, very pleased when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>
assumed that it was actually a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gunman</ENAMEX> or
what-have-you.  His original intention was merely to
slip it past the censor, but the word took off.





         
         


            In reply to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milton Horowitz</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>], gedunk
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">originated in Harold Teen</ENAMEX>, a comic strip of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenties</TIMEX>,
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Ed</ENAMEX>, replete with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cutie-pie flappers</ENAMEX>,
porkpie hats, bellbottom slacks, and epigraphic yellow
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slickers</ENAMEX> and jalopies.  It was indeed ‚Äúsomething
sold at a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda fountain</ENAMEX> or snack bar.‚Äù  The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">place</ENAMEX> was
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Sugar Bowl</ENAMEX>, owned and operated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pop Jenks</ENAMEX>,
if memory serves.  The only reference I have that
mentions the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strip</ENAMEX> at all ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Penguin Book of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comics</ENAMEX>) is rather sketchy on detail.  As I recall, the
gedunk was a confection devised either by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold</ENAMEX>
Teen or his diminutive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sidekick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Shadow Smart</ENAMEX>.  It
consisted of a ladyfinger dipped between bites in a
mug of hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate</ENAMEX>, hence gedunk .





         
         


            On my entry into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1942</TIMEX>, gedunk was
already well established to refer to any ice-cream
dish with toppings or additions.  On entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naval</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX>, I found that a small ice-cream
bar in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bancroft Hall</ENAMEX> (immidiately
under the main entrance and limited to upperclass
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">midshipmen</ENAMEX>) was semi-officially known as ‚ÄúThe
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gedunk‚Äù</ENAMEX> (pronounced ‚Äúgee-dunk,‚Äù with a hard
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> )--although the wares themselves were never
called gedunks, but ‚Äúchocolate sodas,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù ‚Äúsundaes</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            For origins, try <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennsylvania Dutch</ENAMEX> dunk for
`dip,' leading to such usages as dunders and dunkshot --which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapman</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Slang</ENAMEX> ] traces back
to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1920s</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gedunk</ENAMEX> is obviously a humorous application
of the past participle of dunk --Crullers
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúgedunked‚Äù</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>--and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> it was obviously
well established in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> to refer to any
concoction involving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice cream</ENAMEX>, and especially to establishments
dispensing it.

            Incidentally, dunk is not proper <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch</ENAMEX>, or even <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afrikaans</ENAMEX> for `dip,' and to the best
of my knowledge would not even be understood as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slang</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afrikaans</ENAMEX>.

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>, I can attest to the common usage of that word
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Navy</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dixie</ENAMEX> was a large tender that repaired and serviced

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vessels</ENAMEX> referred to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Dixie</ENAMEX> as a gedunk <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>, because
she had a refreshment stand where they might
obtain delicacies like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate sundaes</ENAMEX> or gedunks .
I never heard of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pudding</ENAMEX> as a gedunk .  And the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gedunk</ENAMEX> stand on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Dixie</ENAMEX> was forward, not aft.

            
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Thesaurus of Slang</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lester V.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berrey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melvin Van Den Bark</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX>) defines
gedunk as `to eat a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sundae</ENAMEX>' [p. 111 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">94.11</NUMEX>);<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 768</ENAMEX>

edition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thesaurus</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1953</TIMEX>) as a synonym for `ice

            ...
In spite of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternate g'dong</ENAMEX> cited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wentworth</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flexner</ENAMEX>, the noun gedunk --as spoken on

(as indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster III</ENAMEX> ); how the verb was or is
pronounced I do not know.





         
         


            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly proprietor</ENAMEX> (or overage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda jerk</ENAMEX>?)

that, but it seemed to me, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about ten</NUMEX> at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, that gedunk was clearly a verb and in the imperative
mood.  I somehow imagined that it was a
blend of dunk (a popular debate at the time concerned
the propriety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dunking donuts</ENAMEX> in public)
and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> gedenk, the intimate singular imperative
of gedenkn `to remember.'





         
         


            Confusion worse confounded, I fear, over the
origin of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> word for `<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway station</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">[‚ÄúEnglish Know-how, No Problem</ENAMEX>,‚Äù by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bryson</ENAMEX>,

First, the word is not vagzal but vokzal .  <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, it
was not adopted from the name of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vauxhall</ENAMEX> railway
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">station</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, it was not adopted from
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> Volksaal `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s waiting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>'!

            What happened was this: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vauxhall Gardens</ENAMEX>
were a famous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> pleasure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ground</ENAMEX> and ‚Äúplace
of dalliance,‚Äù opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1660</TIMEX> (and known until
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1785</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Spring Gardens</ENAMEX>).  They were named
for their location in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vauxhall</ENAMEX>, south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thames</ENAMEX>.
The gardens gained international fame, and when
similar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> were laid out in continental <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>
they were known generically as vaxuhall .  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>,
the word become associated with the existing zal
`<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>,' so that vokzal meant 'concert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>.'  One such
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hall</ENAMEX> was built at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway station</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pavlovsk</ENAMEX> after
that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was linked by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rail</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Petersburg</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1837</TIMEX>.  As a result, vokzal gained the much wider
sense `<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway station</ENAMEX>.'

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Vauxhall Gardens</ENAMEX> closed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1859</TIMEX>,
but the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> word for `<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway station</ENAMEX>' has preserved
their name.





         
         


            Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryson</ENAMEX> was over-hasty to condemn that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bomber</ENAMEX> jacket in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> as ‚Äúgloriously meaningless‚Äù
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>], for anyone who has spent time on a

a good plain advertisement for the product.  However,

            In the same issue, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McIntosh</ENAMEX> refers to a
‚Äú route mauvais as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> have it.‚Äù  If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
have it, it must read mauvaise; but if what he means
is a road with a bad surface the term used is chauss√©e
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d√©form√©e .</ENAMEX>  And has he not noticed that, e.g., ‚Äúone in
seven‚Äù is now a percentage?

say ‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Äúbuilt-up‚Äù</NUMEX> (as given--applied to heels--in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins Dictionary</ENAMEX>! ).

            And I sympathize with your remark on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brunner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Law of Authorship</ENAMEX> states: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúIn any

            Upon reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Sharp</ENAMEX>'s otherwise well-researched
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> on unmentionables [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVIII,2</NUMEX>], I
had the distinct impression that he had gone too far
in defining that crucial word.  I knew unmentionables
simply as a euphemism for `underwear'; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
dictionaries of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> usage, one thesaurus, and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> (from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharp</ENAMEX>'s own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bear</ENAMEX> out that impression.  Unmentionables
thus underwent the perfectly logical semantic shift
from `trousers' to `undergarments.'  For most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unmentionables</ENAMEX> probably does not cover (pun
intended) the body parts beneath those undergarments
and certainly does not include <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚Äúcurses</ENAMEX> and
biological functions.‚Äù





         
         
            [...Literally, a semantic shift?  --<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX>.]
         
         

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Sharp</ENAMEX>'s essay [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVIII ,2</NUMEX>] on the unmentionability
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s trousers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> brought
to my mind an advertising poem which my grandfather
saw on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early in this century</TIMEX>.
For a long-forgotten brand of trousers, it went like
this:


The pant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter pantless</ENAMEX> is panting for pants.
He pants for the best pants the pant market
grants.
But he panteth unpanted until he implants
Himself in a pair of our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plymouth Rock</ENAMEX> pants.

            





         
         

            In ‚ÄúThe Past As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prologue,‚Äù</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William H.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dougherty</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVI,3</NUMEX>], the solecism like to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">of</NUMEX>, as in The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> like to of killed hisself, is labeled as being limited
to a region of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>.  I have encountered it in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carolina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Wolfe</ENAMEX> puts it into
the mouth of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> in (I think) Look
Homeward, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angel</ENAMEX> .  I have assumed that it derivers
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> expression manquer faire `just miss
doing, almost do,' the primary meaning of manquer
being `to lack,' which could have shifted into colloquial
usage as like .  I cite this merely as a possibility,
definitive proof being pretty hard to dig up.





         
         


            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Galef</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúThe Niceness Principle‚</ENAMEX>Äù
[XVII<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX>] makes a persuasive case for the phenomenon
it describes.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least one</NUMEX> example of movement
in the opposite direction comes readily to mind,
however.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> often hears the term splitting the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">baby</ENAMEX> used to describe the actions of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitrator</ENAMEX>
who has reconciled opposing positions by
what is better described as splitting the difference .
The reference, of course, is to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soloman</ENAMEX>'s decision
when faced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> claiming to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solomonic</ENAMEX> decision,
to award custody to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who was willing to
give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rival</ENAMEX> rather than see it killed by
being split between them was just the opposite of
splitting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> .  Nevertheless, by some apparent
converse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niceness Principle</ENAMEX>, the language
perpetuates the notion that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> was split and
that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> acts wisely in following that example.

            Here is an instance of what Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galef</ENAMEX> calls ‚Äúfalse
recall‚Äù acting not to smooth something out but to
make it rougher than it ever was!





         
         


            Until I read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pagel</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Gnostic Gospels</ENAMEX> I recalled
the expression the naked truth as having derived
from an old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> fable (perhaps from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horace</ENAMEX>,
around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX>) about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Truth and Falsehood</ENAMEX>
emerging from a swim together, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falsehood</ENAMEX> stealing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Truth</ENAMEX>'s clothers.  Truth, in the fable, would rather be
naked than don the clothes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falsehood</ENAMEX>, thus the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">naked Truth</ENAMEX> .  I don't find the story appealing, but it
appears in all references on the derivation of the expression.

            Compare that pale fable with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of the
words of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcus</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> of the gnostic teacher
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valentinus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c. 140 A.D.</ENAMEX>) who, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pagel</ENAMEX> writes, describes
the vision that ‚Äúdescended upon him ...in the
form of a woman‚Äù who says to him, ‚ÄúI wish to show
you Truth herself; for I have brought her down from
above, so that you may see her without a veil, and
understand her beauty.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Pagel</ENAMEX> then quotes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcus</ENAMEX>
on how <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúthe naked Truth‚Äù</ENAMEX> came to him in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s
form.

            I suppose it is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valentinus</ENAMEX> repeated
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horace</ENAMEX>'s metaphor in different, more dramatic
terms <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a hundred years later</TIMEX>.  Or each was independently
inspired to imagine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Truth</ENAMEX> as an unclothed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.  From now on, I go with the derivation from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Valentinus the Gnostic</ENAMEX>.  Has a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> any thoughts on the subject?





         
         


            May I add a gracenote to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> concerning
word processing spelling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">checkers</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVII,3</NUMEX>]?

            I make part of my living as a freelance in word
processing and other computer applications.  Some
time ago I was creating a document for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX>, using
a program which I will not name to protect the
guilty, although it was--and still is, by general consent
(my own included)--the best of the pack.  My
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> asked me to run ‚ÄúSpellCheck,‚Äù and I complied.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> rejected the word practicalities
and suggested ‚Äúproctolitis‚Äù in its place, thereby
neatly illustrating my contention that spelling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">checkers</ENAMEX>,
as reliable aids to cleaning up one's copy, are a
pain in the ass.

            Your article on the Reverend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter W. Skeat</ENAMEX>
[XVIII<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX>] was interesting midway through the first
column on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>; in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> paragraph of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skeat</ENAMEX>'s reply, the article becomes positively fascinating:

...I wrote about the word to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N & Q.</ENAMEX>

            

            A little over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> I was on the verge of
buying a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX> & <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">P 12 x 15</ENAMEX> press with power and joining
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amalgamated Printers Association</ENAMEX>.  Everything
related to the old-fashioned letter press seemed on
the up-and-up except that no one knew the origins
of wayzgoose , neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APA</ENAMEX> nor the
dictionaries available to me.

            With your contacts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> you should have
to access to relevant issues of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> cited.  Or,
even better, perhaps you already know the etymology
of wayzgoose .

            I take exception to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Abate</ENAMEX>'s use of the

HumpTulips , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVIII,2</NUMEX>].  Perhaps if he
spelled it properly as one word--not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>--he
would see it as we do: a logical name of a river (and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX>) derived from the local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native Americans</ENAMEX>.

(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ebenezer Cobham</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Brewer's Dictionary of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phrase & Fable</ENAMEX> was widely accepted by the literati of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>.  A monumental work first published in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1879</TIMEX>, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the century</TIMEX> it had sold an astonishing
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> copies, an outstanding bestseller for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX>.  Attempts at updating it have been
largely unsatisfactory, for they are marred not only
by poor choices for addenda but mainly by the deletion
of colorful, interesting, quaint, and charming
older entries to make room for the new.  Fortunately,
facsimile editions of the original have been
published, and copies of early printing crop up now
and then at reasonable prices in the antiquarian
book trade.

            It is no small wonder that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cassell</ENAMEX> commissioned
a new edition, one that would, presumably, do for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX> what the original had done (in
part) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th</TIMEX>.  I say ‚Äúin part‚Äù because the original
covered the literature, folklore, and culture of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> from antiquity.  Thus the present work, restricted
to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th century</TIMEX>, has a limited skein to
unwind.  Aside from that, the main attractions of the
earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brewer</ENAMEX> were its eminent readability, its obscure
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">references</ENAMEX>, its curiosities, and its browsability.

            It is no fault of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> that familiarity breeds
contempt: most of the references in this edition occurred
within the living memory of many of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contemporaries</ENAMEX>,
which leads one to argue with some of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>.  Also, there is something about the
book that does not encourage the sort of browsing
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with the original.  It is the errors of
fact that occasion the greatest irritation, however:
many of them could have been caught had the book
been subjected to a careful reading by a knowledgeable
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, for, as will be seen, the preponderance
of them occurs when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> try to
describe things <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>:

I would argue that the term is not slang (slang
words and expressions usually have a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> in the standard language) and it is
most certainly not ‚Äúteenage,‚Äù its origin having
been in the theater.

What a curious way of identifying a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>.
Why is she in, anyway?

hard sell...<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salespersons</ENAMEX> using the technique...

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">holiday</ENAMEX> timeshare <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> who...lure
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>...to buy a share in a property, which
most can ill afford.

Although the basic definition (`aggressive
marketing') is essentially correct, the term
refers to salesmanship, not the (broader)
concept of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúmarketing</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  There is nothing
inherent in hard sell to imply dishonest
procedures, and whether a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> can afford
something he buys is totally irrelevant.


hard shoulder The raised roughly surfaced strip
running along the edge of a motorway, which
is used for emergency stops.  It is illegal to
use--or stop on--the hard shoulder for any
reason that is not an emergency.

Ignoring the bad writing, it is wrong to say that
the hard shoulder is raised: in fact, it is often
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roadway</ENAMEX> that is raised above the hard
shoulder, which, besides, is not necessarily
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly</NUMEX> surfaced (though it might be paved in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asphalt</ENAMEX> alongside a macadam <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roadway</ENAMEX>).  And
what relevance has a law in such a definition?

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlem</ENAMEX> toothpick... As a switch-blade <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">knife</ENAMEX> it

Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harlem</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toothpick</ENAMEX> nor switchblade
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">knife</ENAMEX> is mentioned in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Threepanny Opera</ENAMEX>.
As it is the lyrics that are relevant, they were
translated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Blitzstein</ENAMEX> from Bertold
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brecht</ENAMEX>'s original.  The name is spelled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc</ENAMEX> the

Most hippies <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">smoked grass</ENAMEX> (marijuana), not

Why not capitalized?


and that ain't <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hay</ENAMEX>...it means: `don't turn your
nose up at that, it's not to be ignored'.  It was
used as the title of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbott</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Costello</ENAMEX> film
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX>.

It means `and that's not insignificant.'  The
correct title of the film was <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">That Ain't Hay</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hays</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>...formed in response to growing
public indignation at sexual boldness on the
screen and the unsuitable behaviour off screen
of some film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>, notably <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FATTY Arbuckle</ENAMEX>.

It is worth mentioning that the main
characteristic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hays</ENAMEX> office censorship
standards included forbidding the showing of a
married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> in the same bed (fully clothed).
Only certain (puritanical) segments of the public
were indignant at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>' behaviour off screen:
most drank it up.  In view of the fact that the
entry for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fatty Arbuckle</ENAMEX> mentions that he was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exonerated</ENAMEX>, the comment here is at worst
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">libelous</ENAMEX> and at best unfair.

headhunt To seek out a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> already in
employment and offer him or her a post,
usually at a higher level, in a company
involved in the same kind of business.

Almost completely wrong (for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>): the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> need not be employed; and neither the
level nor the kind of business has anything to do
with it.  An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> of a steel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> might be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">headhunted</ENAMEX> to direct a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> making
airplane parts or computers.  The emphasis is
usually on recruiting executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX>.


A heartbeat away from the presidency...it is
probably meant to focus the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>' attention
on the [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice-</ENAMEX>presidential] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>'s potential.
Nothing of the kind.  It is used to play on the
fear of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> lest they elect a vice president
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unsuitable</ENAMEX> to become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, a position he
might have to fill at a moment's notice.  The
expression arose during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eisenhower</ENAMEX>'s
administration.

Eat your heart out!...`I can do as well as you
can, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX>', or `It's time to watch out, you have

The phrase means `to be consumed by one's own
feelings of envy.'

important, or meaningful, e.g. a heavy date.

The term was in use long before hippies were a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gleam</ENAMEX> in anyone's eye; it is probably an
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">extension</ENAMEX> from the theatrical term for the villain
of the piece, later transferred to mean `serious,
important.'

            The book is riddled with such errors and misconceptions,
apparently owing to the fact that no knowledgeable
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> was engaged to review.
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>.  It says, for instance, that The Three
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Stooges</ENAMEX>' films ‚Äúhad a comparatively short life,‚Äù obviously
unaware that they are still shown regularly on
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> television.  ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSBK Boston</ENAMEX> runs them continuously
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</TIMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Eve day every year</TIMEX>.)  It defines
sting as `a robbery or con trick,' when, in fact,
the term refers to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of several phases in a
carefully orchestrated confidence game.  The entry
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">swat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> should be shown as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWAT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> , and it is
not slang.  And at cry all the way to the bank one
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reads ‚ÄúA</ENAMEX> later sarcastic version is laugh all the way
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> .‚Äù  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who wrote that could use a
review course on the meaning of sarcastic .

            I am informed that this book has received uniformly
favorable reviews and that it is selling like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotcakes</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> may draw his own conclusions
about the ignorance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> and the gullibility of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>.

            It is perhaps unfair to review the Bloomsbury
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictionary of Phrase & Allusion</ENAMEX> alongside the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brewer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twentieth Century</ENAMEX>: despite the similarity of
the titles, the former is a slighter work; also, it consists
largely of quotations and the titles of books,
plays, films, and other written works traceable to
them (and vice versa).  The writting is better, however,
it is generally more accurate (though it, too,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">misspells Charles M. Schulz</ENAMEX>'s name), and there is a
little overlap.  For instance, the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbott</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costello</ENAMEX> movie is (correctly given as That Ain't
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Hay</ENAMEX> ,) though it adds the suggestion that the film
probably gave currency to the expression, which is
quite far from the fact.  The orientation of the two
books is different: the interval of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> pages covered
in the comments on the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Brewer</ENAMEX> (which
includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">146</NUMEX> entries) occupies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only eight</NUMEX> pages in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomsbury</ENAMEX> (which has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> entries, both counts
including cross references); of these, only about a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dozen</ENAMEX> appear in both books.

            The point of departure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rees</ENAMEX>'s book is literary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">references</ENAMEX>, while that of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Brewer</ENAMEX> is popular
culture as reflected in catch-phrases.  Provided that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> makes sure to double-check the information
in both books and is not tempted to accept as gospel
everything encountered in either work, both books
should be considered useful additions to a reference
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lunatic Lovers of Language</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> of science fiction have occasionally
been exposed to invented words and languages used
by extraterrestrials.  Some of the words associated
with sci fi were discussed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Hirschberg</ENAMEX>
in ‚ÄúZap the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BEMs!--‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XV,4</NUMEX>], but that article
dealt with words and not languages, and, with a few
exceptions, with words used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> in some future
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, not by extraterrestrials (either now or in
the future).  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Some years ago</TIMEX> I met a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who was
writing her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX>'s thesis on languages created by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sci-fi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>, but she never sent me a promised
copy (or, maybe I just dreamt the whole thing.)

            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> avoid the language problem by introducing
mental telepathy as the means of communication,
which is just as well: human speech employs
the available organs situated between the
lungs and the face, and there is no reason to assume
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>-faced or vegetablelike or otherwise constituted
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extraterrestrials</ENAMEX> would be endowed with like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX> (any more than are many nonhuman
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> on earth), and they would thus be unlikely
to use languages constructed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>.  The language
of extraterrestrials merits only passing mention
in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lunatic Lovers of Language</ENAMEX>, which deals with
the development of artificial languages and with the
search for language universals, characteristics that
many (or all) languages share and that lend credence
to the notion that there was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> original language
from which the present stock has liverged.
(Without going into the matter here, it must be said
that universals concern themselves with underlying
structures of language, not with superficial correspondences
of the type that enable us to identify
language <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.)

            The following passage will help to explain the
slightly off-putting title and will impart to the reader
a sample of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s humor, which I find engaging:


Just take a look at the lunatic in love with language
the logophile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventor</ENAMEX> of languages.
Sitting in his book-lined study, he collects great
piles of information, he collates and classifies it,
he makes lists and fills card indexes.  He is in the
clutches of a denominatory delirium, of a taxonomic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">madness</ENAMEX>.  He has to name everything, but
before being able to name, he has to recognise
and classify concepts, to enclose the whole Universe
in a system of notation: produce enumerations,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hierarchies</ENAMEX> and paradigms.  A lunatic ambition;
yet there is something grandiose in it which
you can't help admiring.  So much energy spent
for so little result.  I don't believe any other fantasy
has ever been pursued with so much ardour
by the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirit</ENAMEX>, apart perhaps from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">philosopher</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stone</ENAMEX> or the proof of the existence of
God; or that any other utopia has caused so much
ink to flow, apart perhaps from socialism.  [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p.17</ENAMEX>]


            

            Try as hard as they might, inventors of artificial
languages have been unable to disbuse themselves
of the ineluctable attraction of their own, native language
or language <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.   Thus, for example,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zamenhof</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esperanto</ENAMEX> is easy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indo-European</ENAMEX>
languages to learn (especially if they know
some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Romance language</ENAMEX>): <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zamenhof</ENAMEX> was a
Pole who knew other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> languages.  But Esperanto
is lingua incognita to the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, or any other non-Indo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>
language, notwithstanding its somewhat
simplified structure, which aids in its rapid assimilation.
Now that certain (very literate) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have
taken hold of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esperanto</ENAMEX> and published novels and
poetry in it, its chief function as a means of basic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> has been violated, and with the onset
of its sophistication it has become more complex,
thus defeating its original purpose.  Esperantists are
an eagerly energetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> who believer in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Esperanto</ENAMEX>;
as far as I know, there are no ‚Äúnative‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esperanto</ENAMEX>.  If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esperanto</ENAMEX> is aspiring to become
a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúreal‚Äù language</ENAMEX>, then it must begin to behave like
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and, before long, it will begin to suffer the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúweaknesses‚Äù</ENAMEX> that natural languages suffer--polysemy
and pleurisemy.  Before you know it, you are
saying to yourself, ‚ÄúWhy should I bother to learn a
whole new grammer and vocabulary of Esperanto
when I can learn some sort of lingua franca (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, for example) which at least has an extensive
literature to offer?  Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, far from an
easy language to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX>, has probably replaced
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> as the most universally used lingua franca.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yiddish</ENAMEX> serves as a lingua franca of sorts for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>--
whatever they may be--but it seems to be diminishing
in that role and is, I understand, frowned upon
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> (many of whom can now claim <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>
as a native tongue).

            This is a curious book.  Those who might be encouraged
by this brief review to read it ought to
know that frequent recourse to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appendix II</ENAMEX> will
clarify many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s references--indeed,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> would do well to read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appendix II</ENAMEX> after reading
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Introduction</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, a linguist, is often obscure,
though it is impossible to know whether that
is her fault or her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX>'s.  I was unsure, for instance,
exactly how to understand the following sentence,
which opens <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter I,</ENAMEX> and which seems curiously
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unidiomatic</ENAMEX> (or, in my ignorance, perhaps it
is poetic):


How it came about the the myth could take the place
of history, and feed both fiction and utopia, that
fiction in the form of dogma of various kinds
could take the place of science, that science
could progressively dominate fiction, that history,
in eliminating myth, could itself become a science,
at the cost of a ruthless battle between the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">imaginary</ENAMEX> and the real--a battle whose outcome,
even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, remains unclear--this story reads
like a novel: and in any case, doesn't the word
history itself, which designates a succession of
facts through time, also encapsulate the word
story: a tale, a fable, an imaginary account? [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p.5</ENAMEX>]

            

            I suppose that is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, but it is certainly anacoluthic,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">obscure</ENAMEX>, and viciously punctuated (after the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> style, which can be destructive to both sense
and grammar).

            The flashes of wisdom should not be overlooked,
however:


The same impoverishment of formal devices is
found in examples of religious glossolalia, with an
exaggerated tendency towards repetition, syllable
reduplication, vocalic parallelism, open syllabification,
excessive symmetry in contrasts, an impoverished
inventory of sounds--whatever the
mother tongue of the glossolalist.  [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p.100</ENAMEX>]

            

            ...and that appears in an analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martian</ENAMEX>.  Some
of this would be quite funny if it weren't so serious.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> is encouraged to find out for himself.

by names like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilyn Monroe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queen of Rumania</ENAMEX>, is identified as ‚Äúthe‚Äù
model, as if she were being distinguished from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rachael Garley</ENAMEX> who succeeded Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randolph Quirk</ENAMEX>
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy</ENAMEX> and that other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rachael Garley</ENAMEX> whom we all know to be the (not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äúa‚Äù</ENAMEX>) power behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Yeltsin or Saddam Husein</ENAMEX>.
Or perhaps she is identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúthe‚Äù</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> just to
remind us that she is an outstandingly unique and
famous model, to be distinguished from what might
otherwise be characterized as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúa‚Äù</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, which
would make her just another one of the pack.  In
such cases, ‚Äúthe‚Äù is followed by a real or implied
‚Äúwell-known‚Äù or some equivalent thereof, to wit,
( internationally) famous, beloved, notorious, undisputed,
disputed, recently released (or Escaped ), prize-winning,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">novelist</ENAMEX>, etc.  Note the difference between
the transposed form,... with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, Rachael
Garley, and Mr ...., and the form as given:... with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rachael Garley</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, and Mr. ... Clearly, the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> seems to call for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">‚Äúa model</ENAMEX>,‚Äù for the name, surrounded
by punctuation becomes less significant;
also, in that sequence the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> is not boxed into
the corner of obligation where he must stand, face to
the wall, if unaware of who this ‚Äúin‚Äù personage
might be.  If a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> today were to encounter
a reference to, say, ‚Äúthe madam, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polly Adler</ENAMEX>,‚Äù
the question might well come up, ‚ÄúWho was or is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polly Adler?‚Äù</ENAMEX>  in which case the reply would probably
go something like, ‚ÄúShe was A well-known
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothel-keeper</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s and '30s</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
That is, the ‚Äúthe‚Äù would naturally and abruptly
change to an ‚Äúa,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> (particularly in reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX>, where it is acknowledged that brothel-keeping
was endemic and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">madams</ENAMEX>' fame universal).  Had the
reply been, ‚ÄúShe was THE well-known brothelkeeper...,‚Äù
that could have been interpreted as a
put-down of the questioner, as if to say, ‚ÄúYou stupid
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ignoramus</ENAMEX>!  Everyone (else) in the world knows that
she was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brothel-Keeper Extraordinaire of New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">York!‚Äù</ENAMEX>

            This approach is often used by ‚Äúentertainers‚Äù
who invoke strange names of strange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to demonstrate
to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> that they are au fait with the
latest, though I am never quite sure ‚Äúthe latest
what.‚Äù  It is also the technique of the ‚Äúin‚Äù joke
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> between such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entertainers</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX>,
though how ‚Äúin‚Äù something can be when
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> is debatable.  I felt definitely
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúout‚Äù</ENAMEX> when I first heard a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> applaud
with chuckling appreciation at the mention of the
name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Val Doonican</ENAMEX> .  For all I knew, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who
said it had made up the name and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> was
laughing because the name was funny, as they might
well do when hearing a name like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kylie Minogue</ENAMEX> .  It
took me a while to understand that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kylie Minogue</ENAMEX> is
the name of a real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>.  I also discovered that Val
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doonican</ENAMEX> is the name of a real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>.  Though I
have no way of knowing whether either name is genunine
or assumed, it occurs to me that if one wanted
to assume a name, more euphonious choices might
present themselves.  On the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kylie Minogue</ENAMEX>
does have a certain je ne sais pas about it (as I
once heard someone say).  Certainly, it seems unlikely
that someone would have to refer to her as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúKylie Minogue</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX>,‚Äù except for the benefit
of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who need the reinforcement afforded
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúMargaret Thatcher</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX>,‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúGeorge Bush</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äù or ‚ÄúElizabeth II</ENAMEX>, the
queen,‚Äù as if to distinguish them from the local
roofer, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">itinerant</ENAMEX> hedge-trimmer, or the ocean
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">liner</ENAMEX>.  There are not a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime ministers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX>,
and queens about--at least, not that we are
exposed to continually in the media--and it would
be a bit ludicrous to read <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about ‚</NUMEX>ÄúMargaret <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX>,‚Äù etc.  On the other hand, till she
becomes as famous as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth II</ENAMEX>, it
seems to me that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rachael Garley</ENAMEX> ought to be referred
to as ‚Äúa,‚Äù not ‚Äúthe <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  To be sure, there
are not a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rachael Garleys, Val Doonicans</ENAMEX>, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kylie Minogues</ENAMEX> about, either, for which we and they
may be equally thankful.
