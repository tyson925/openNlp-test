               The thought of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uncle</ENAMEX> Louie speaking in tongues
was fascinating... what if he stood up and said,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúFeemalator</ENAMEX>, jasperator, hoo <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ha ha</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wamalamagamanama</ENAMEX>,

            Exotic, strange-sounding, and unintelligible
words, whether authentic and foreign or artificial
and spontaneously made up on the spot, are an
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age-old</TIMEX> and pandemic device for creating an aura of
mystery, holiness, or magic.  The use of genuine foreign
languages is called xenoglossia .  Familiar examples
are the ancient languages, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Coptic</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, used in modern liturgies.  However,
the peculiarity of incantations and prayers is
nothing new.  It is attested in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Babylonian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> religious and magical texts preserved
on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay tablets</ENAMEX>, papyrus, parchment, gems,
and strips of metal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX>.  In ancient
Hittite religious texts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accadian</ENAMEX> words provide the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mysterious</ENAMEX>, exotic sounds; in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin</ENAMEX> it is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX>
words; in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aramaic</ENAMEX>; in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>
prayers <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> was used.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glossolalia</ENAMEX> is the technical term for artificial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">languages</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúspeaking in tongues,‚Äù as it is more
commonly known.  To cite just a few ancient examples,
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assyrian</ENAMEX> incantation for retrieving a fugitive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">slave</ENAMEX> begins with the following nonsense sequence:
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">en ki-su</ENAMEX>-al-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">lu</NUMEX>-ki...ki-ku-al-lu...ki na...gi-na-al-qi
( Orientalia <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23 , 1954</TIMEX>, pp. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52-53</NUMEX>).  An <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX>

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coptic</ENAMEX> magical texts
from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> (dating from the 1st <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.B.C.</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">11th</NUMEX> c.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.D.</ENAMEX>) are replete with concatenations of voces magicae,
some with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to a hundred</NUMEX> letters, such as the
more mellifluous: melibou melibau melibaubau,
touchar souchar, nennana sennana, samousoum
souma soume soumeia meisouat srouat... rouat , or
the cacophonous: chuchbachuch bauachuch bakaxichuch
bazabachuch bachaxichuch bazetophoth
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bainchoooch</ENAMEX> .  (Psycholinguists like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F. Trojan</ENAMEX> even
trace relationships between word sounds and word
meanings, the deep, dark vowels like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">o</ENAMEX> and u having
an awesome, threatening, secretive nature on the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hand, and on the other the lighter ones like e

            Some of these ancient nonsensical magical
words enjoyed exceptional longevity.  Meriut,

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years later</TIMEX>.  More recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goethe</ENAMEX> in his Reineke
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuchs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gesang</ENAMEX>) wrote: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúund sie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legt</ENAMEX>' ihm die

Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garrison Keillor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy narrator</ENAMEX>, with his
arooaroo <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">halama rama</ENAMEX> , is simply continuing a universal

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magicians</ENAMEX>--and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>--through the millennia.

            There is no law against combining bogus, ad
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hoc , ‚Äúforeign‚</ENAMEX>Äù words and the real thing in one
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">breath</ENAMEX>, just as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keillor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> does in his ‚ÄúAltrusian‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blessing</ENAMEX>, juxtaposing what is obviously nonsense
next to genuine <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> ( domino ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>
( shadrach, meshach, abednego ).  Likewise, in ancient
Greek magical texts snippets of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>,
Aramaic, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Coptic</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Babylonian</ENAMEX> words and proper
names commingle in happy abandon with endless
concatenations of gibberish, producing a veritable
Babelian babble to challenge the ingenuity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indo-European</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Semitist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> alike <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thousand</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years later</TIMEX>, as they wrangle with these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX>-than-sesquipedalian
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">creations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greco</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> magical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">fantasy</ENAMEX>.  For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">palindrome</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aberamenthooulerthexanaxethreluoothnemareba</ENAMEX> ,
according to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> philologist, is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> for `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Powerful One</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waters</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Thoth, God of Rain, O Sovereign:</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rain</ENAMEX> of God, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thoth</ENAMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Powerful Waters</ENAMEX>.'

            Keillor, by incorporating the names of the three
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">youths</ENAMEX> in the fiery furnace into his blessing, is
merely following in the footsteps of some of his forebears
in esotericism, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Copts</ENAMEX> of early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, who often invoked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shadrach, Meshach</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abednego</ENAMEX> alongside such fantasy figures as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thoulal</ENAMEX>,
Moulal, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boulal</ENAMEX> in their magical charms.  (In all
probability we owe to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Coptic Christians</ENAMEX> the invention,
and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coptic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magicians</ENAMEX> the dispersion,
of the names of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> wise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, who make their
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appearance, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melchior</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thattasia, Bathesora</ENAMEX>,
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Coptic</ENAMEX> magical texts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6th-8th</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c. A.D.</ENAMEX>)

            Aside from the linguistic challenges they pose,
these ancient artificial, noncewords, with their sonorous,
cantillating, rhyming, and rhythmical variations
on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">phonetic</NUMEX> themes, have intrigued and fascinated
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> who try to divine the rules governing
their formation.  For example, variations on a theme
involving homoiarcton and homoioteleuton (similar
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beginnings</ENAMEX> and endings; of. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keillor</ENAMEX>'s ‚Äúfeemal ator ,‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äújasper ator ‚Äù</ENAMEX>) is a common device.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> magical
spell for conjuring up a deity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7th-8th</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.A.D.</ENAMEX>) begins
with the following nonsense sequence,
armapophar, astramuphar, astramuchur , and continues
with a series of transmutations typical of magical
texts.  Taking off from armapophar , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> transmuted
the beginning to astra - and the ending to
- muphar .  For the next variation he combined and
retained astra - + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mu</NUMEX> - but then altered the ending to
- chur .  Later on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> finds: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chla, Achla, Achlamu</ENAMEX>,
Chlas! , showing variations on the theme <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chla</ENAMEX> .  Another
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jingle</ENAMEX> in the same text runs: otra peruth,...
methor baruthar, eseluth with the obvious themes
per-, bar-, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-uth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-uthar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-ethor</ENAMEX> , setting the tone in this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ancient</ENAMEX> version of a magical patter song or jazz scat.

            Another theory is that this mumbo jumbo may
represent a kind of ancient pig <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> which, if properly
decoded, might actually make sense.  Hidden
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anagrams</ENAMEX> might be lurking there, awaiting the alert
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> to come along and detect them.  Taking the
example cited above: otra perouth might be transmogrified
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">o pater</ENAMEX>, therapeue `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">O Father</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heal</ENAMEX>!'

            Going a step further, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguists</ENAMEX> have noted the
similarity between the sonorous sound manipulations
of such artificial words in magical incantations
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s game songs.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX>--and, in earlier
times, illiterates--often took snippets of liturgical
texts which they had heard in church on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>,
adapting sing-song versions of them for their own
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">irreligious</ENAMEX> and irreverent use on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>.  According
to some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>, the universally known and applied
designation for magic, hocus pocus , may ultimately
derive from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin Eucharist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formula</ENAMEX> and
represent a muddled version of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX>'s words in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vulgate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">New Testament</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I Cor</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.24</NUMEX>]: hoc <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">est</TIMEX> corpus
meum `this is my body.'  Likewise, abracadabra ,
it has been suggested, might stem from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> habracah
dabrah `pronounce the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blessing</ENAMEX>.'

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> around the world hold these alliterative
and rhyming nonsensical sequences in great respect
and are careful to incant them with meticulous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exactitude</ENAMEX>.  Furthermore, they seriously believe
their jungles are genuine foreign languages--for example,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>--and hallowed by hoary antiquity.
While their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">etymology</ENAMEX> may be doubted,
‚Äúthat these rhymes are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries old</TIMEX> is not to be
lightly dismissed.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>  <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. Opie</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children's Games</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wescott</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Lloyd</ENAMEX>, discussed rhyming, rhythmical,

which exist not only in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> but in other

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dran</ENAMEX> ; in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sain et sauf</ENAMEX> .  Alongside such fixed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">combinations</ENAMEX>, which seem to adhere to their own
rhythmic and phonetic rules, are the playful, nonsensical,
purely rhythmical and melodious formulations,
which distinctly recall the ancient incantatory
cantillations characteristic of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> and latterday hocus pocus.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>:

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just a few</TIMEX>.

            These perhaps quondam ad hoc expressions,
now part and parcel of our respective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> languages,
adhere to the same general rhythmical and
phonological rules as the nonsense words in the
magical texts.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Winkler</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> Semitist,
noted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1935</TIMEX> that glossolalia, incantations, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s
chants all display certain common tendencies,
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">namely, 1</ENAMEX>) the repetition of a given motif
( feemalator, jasperator; touchar souchar; astramuphar,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">astramuchur</ENAMEX> ), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), the economical use of
the vocal apparatus.  Repeating a word or syllable or
sound puts the least strain on the voice.  Yet human
creative ingenuity is not satisfied with repetition; it
wants something new.  Thus, once a pleasing motif
has been discovered, the next least exerting is to reproduce
it with a slight variation.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winkler</ENAMEX> discovered
that the first element of binomials, whether
nonsense or not, often begins with a laryngeal or velar
phoneme which is formed in the back of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mouth</ENAMEX> (i.e., aspirated and unaspirated vowels).  Taking
the above examples, hunkydory, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">higgledy-pig-gledy</ENAMEX>,
hanky-panky, hocus pocus, heebie-jeebies,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hodgepodge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">hokey-pokey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">inky-dinky</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">itsy-bitsy</ENAMEX>,
Holterdipolter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√</ENAMEX>ºlle und <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F√ºlle</ENAMEX> , as can be noted, the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> element tends to be a repetition of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>,
beginning, however, with a labial ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>, b, f, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>, v, w ).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Winkler</ENAMEX> called this the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">‚Äú aleph-beth rule‚Äù</ENAMEX> and demonstrated
its practically universal validity, citing evidence
from both medieval and modern gaming
rhymes in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Semitic</ENAMEX> languages alike.
Going a step further, he found that nonsense trinomials
generally continue with a word beginning with
a palatal ( ch, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>, j, k ).  As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early as 1835</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Lepsius</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> Egyptologist, had pointed out the
curious fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hebrew</ENAMEX> alphabet contained no
fewer than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of letters which adhere to
this rule: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) aleph, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beth</ENAMEX>, gimel, daleth; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) he, waw...
heth, teth; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) ayin, pe...koph...taw.

            This evidently primordial phonetic series has
continued to persist through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ages</TIMEX> and is obviously
as eminently appealing to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keillor</ENAMEX>'s youthful
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">narrator</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as it was to his forebears several
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">millennia ago</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> a world away.  By initiating
his glossolalic cant with beth -element words
( feemalator, wamalama ) and continuing with palatal
variations on their respective themes ( jasperator,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gamanama</ENAMEX> ) the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> is apparently responding to the
same primal urge that motivated the anonymous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creators</ENAMEX>
of our alphabet to begin their artificial series of
sounds with aleph, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beth</ENAMEX>, gimel , and daleth --and not
with something like zis boom bah!

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sociologists</ENAMEX>, military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>, computer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mavens</ENAMEX>, other distinguished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>: At this point in
our annual meeting, we pay tribute to some verbal
form that spreads confusion wherever it appears.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, you recall, we honoured the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of consecutive
nouns, to your enthusiastic applause.

            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Tonight</TIMEX>, we lift our glasses to the tautology.
Nothing comes from nothing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucretius</ENAMEX> argued two
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thousand years ago</TIMEX>, and tautologists have proved
him right.  At once simple and inscrutable, the tautology
promises more than it delivers.  In the right
hands, it can be disarming (‚ÄúThe speculation has no
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foundation‚Äù</ENAMEX>), profound (‚ÄúDeath leaves a gap in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social structure‚Äù</ENAMEX>), echolatic (‚ÄúExit access is that part
of a means of egress that leads to an entrance to an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exit‚Äù</ENAMEX>), hortatory (‚ÄúIf we do nothing to change this
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, we shall remain frozen in the status quo‚Äù).

            Some think tautologies nothing but verbiage,
but how wrong they are!  To <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Language Abusers</ENAMEX> mere
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wordiness</ENAMEX> deserves no special recognition: it is the
good manners expected of those who sit at our table.
The tautology stupefies, however; it makes readers
shake their heads or gaze blankly at their pages.
This is art we must celebrate.

            Certainly, not all tautologists explore the form's
splendid possibilities.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yogi Berra</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX> of the record
for tautologies uttered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a single season</TIMEX>, simply
repeated the same words in a sentence <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">(‚ÄúIt</ENAMEX> ain't
over 'til it's over.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>)  Although some find this charming,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Language Abusers</ENAMEX> prefer a style that more subtly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pretends</ENAMEX> to convey <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ideas while conveying
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX>.  (‚ÄúPoor assessment technology made enemy
losses difficult to estimate‚Äù).

            Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>, of course, do not think Language
Absures subtle.  The quality <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York Times</ENAMEX> claim that we are crude
promulgators of error, little more than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flat Earthers</ENAMEX>
of language.  Admittedly, we take pride in confounding
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, but we are never crude.  Consider
the form we honour <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this evening</TIMEX>: the tautology
causes confusion by stating an absolute truth.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Truthful</ENAMEX>, bewildering, remarkable--the tautology
deserves a hallowed place in the pantheon of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Language Abuse</ENAMEX>.  Let us drink to its glory.

            Investigating the Racqueteers



            So far as I know, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> of so-called ‚Äúracquet
games‚Äù are not required to submit to examinations
that might test whether or not they know what
they are talking about; but I have a feeling the idea
might be useful, for there is an incredible amount of
misunderstanding and downright ignorance of which
name refers to which sport.  In short, these games
have an identity problem.  It is as if in a particular
neighborhood one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> were named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>, another
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones-Smith</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> and, because
of this peculiar set of circumstances, their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> spent most of their time trying to distinguish
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> from the other instead of enjoying their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.

            As an experienced practitioner of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">paddle tennis</ENAMEX>,
squash, badminton, platform tennis, etc., over the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past twenty years</TIMEX> I have become convinced that a
revised nomenclature for racquet sports is in order.
Perhaps the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who can define these activities
precisely are those who write about them and
those who are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>.  Others,
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> of retail tennis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX>,
and regular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> (who number in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX>)
seem to be totally in the dark about such matters as
the proper distinction between paddle <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis and</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">platform tennis</ENAMEX> and whether the terms paddleball
and racquetball are interchangeable.  It is next to impossible
to carry on an intelligent conversation
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> racquet sports because there is no terminology
on which all can agree.  By contrast, when one
mentions hockey, <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">cricket</ENAMEX> , a clear picture
comes to mind, and one is not compelled to waste
his time agonizing over the meanings of words.

            To begin with let us list some of the official
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">racquet</ENAMEX> games, both ancient and modern, that may
be defined in a standard dictionary or encyclopedia
of sport: <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis; lawn tennis</ENAMEX>; squash tennis; paddle
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX>; platform tennis; table <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis; paddleball</ENAMEX>; racquetball;
squash racquets; badminton; and racquets .
The most obvious characteristic of this list is that
most of these games appear, at least, to be variations
of the game of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> , yet in reality they cannot be
technically classified as such.  A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> characteristic
is the lack of consistency in the origins of the
terms.  For example, some have derivations distinctly
removed from the equipment used or the
court on which the game is played.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Badminton</ENAMEX> derives
from the name of the estate in Gloucestershire
where the game was first played in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>; tennis
stems from tenetz , an old form of tenez , from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
tenir `to hold'; and squash , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>,
probably grew out of the ‚Äúsquashy‚Äù sound which
the original soft ball made against the wall of the
court.  Interestingly, in spite of their obscure origins,
these are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> racquet sports whose
names communicate something specific to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">layman</ENAMEX>.
The confusion comes with those games whose
names emerged from the equipment used ( <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">paddleball</ENAMEX> )
or from the peculiarities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> construction
( platform tennis ).  A tangential problem relates
to certain ancient racquet sports approaching obsolescence
( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> tennis, racquets, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">squash</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> , for example)
whose original clear-cut identity has become
hazy owing to recently created sports, such as racquetball
and platform tennis , which share some of
the characteristics of the older games.

            Let us examine the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> terms court tennis, tennis ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">lawn tennis</ENAMEX> .  Of course, nothing should be
done to change the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">label court</ENAMEX> tennis , which still refers
to the archaic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-wall game played by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIII</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hampton Court Palace</ENAMEX>.
However, it would seem that, because of recent
developments in court surface technology, <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">lawn tennis</ENAMEX> ,
which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 1975</TIMEX> was an umbrella designation
for a game played on a variety of surfaces, should be
restricted to the few remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wimbledon</ENAMEX>,
that maintain grass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>.  Clearly, the term
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">lawn</ENAMEX> , with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its 19th-century</TIMEX> connotation of society
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">matrons</ENAMEX> batting a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">powder puff</ENAMEX>, should be deleted
from the titles of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> national tennis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.

            A more serious semantic problem is the ambiguity
regarding paddle <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis and platform tennis</ENAMEX> .
Here there is a yawning gulf of misunderstanding
between the aficionados, who insist on a precise distinction,
and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> on the fringes who sloppily
apply the term paddle tennis to both sports.
Some may consider this sheer perversity; however, I
have a feeling that the fault lies with those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> well-meaning
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scarsdale</ENAMEX>, who, in labeling
their unique game, neglected to suggest that it combines
the skills of squash and tennis.  Instead, they
came up with the imprecise platform tennis, which,
to the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, simply means an `elevated
court.'  The meaninglessness of this term is further
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> by the fact that the elevation of the court
has nothing to do with how the game is played.  As
sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> are aware, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> was originally
raised <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several feet</NUMEX> above ground level in order to
put it above the snow level.  However, there is no
reason why, in places where there is little or no
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">snow</ENAMEX>, it could not be played at ground level, and, in
fact, the later <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> are so constructed.  In short,
remove the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> and a new term would have to
be applied to distinguish the game from <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">paddle tennis</ENAMEX>,
which technically is simply a form of miniature
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> and might be better referred to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as ‚</NUMEX>Äúmini-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
As for platform tennis , changing the name to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">squash</ENAMEX> tennis is a possibility if we are willing to concede
that the original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-wall game with this label
is vanishing.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way of putting some of these racquet
games into sharper focus would be to minimize use
of the words paddle and racquet .  To the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">layman</ENAMEX>,
terms like <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">paddleball</ENAMEX>, paddle <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX>, racquets, racquetball ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>, just fuse into a blur.  No one seems to
know if these sports are played on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> with a net,
against a wall, or both.  A suggested solution to the
semantic confusion would be to sharpen the distinction
between <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">paddleball</ENAMEX> and racquetball .  These
games could be defined simply as ` <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">handball</ENAMEX> played
with a paddle,' the only difference being that <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">paddleball</ENAMEX>
employs a perforated wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">racquet</ENAMEX> and a
large spongy ball, while racquetball , which is rapidly
pushing both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">handball</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">paddleball</ENAMEX> into obscurity,
employs a small strung racquet and a lively rubber
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ball</ENAMEX>.  There is even a question as to whether or
not <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">paddleball</ENAMEX> , as defined above, should be considered
a legitimate game, since a wooden paddle is
inappropriate for the quick wrist action that the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-wall game requires.  It seems reasonable to assume
that racquetball will prevail and that paddle-ball
will eventually lose its official sanction and will
be confined to a few die-hard <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eccentrics</ENAMEX>.

            Another minor variation on this theme is the
vagueness related to squash, squash racquets, racquets ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">squash tennis</ENAMEX> .  All these games, of course,
are basically the same in principle in that they involve
playing a ball off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> walls with a strung
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">racket</ENAMEX>, the difference being in the dimensions of the
court, the shape and size of the racket, and the size
and make-up of the ball.  For purposes of communication,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">racquets</ENAMEX> and squash tennis present no serious
problem, as they are confined to a handful of exclusive
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clubs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>
and, regrettably, may soon pass from the scene.
However, the interchangeable terms, squash and
squash racquets require some clarification.  Technically,
there is no official game called squash: it is
merely a convenient clipped usage.  But perhaps
some consideration should be given to separating
squash racquets more precisely from those games
from which it derives and with which it is often confused.
The obvious method of doing this is to make
the term squash <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>, thus eliminating the identity
problem and giving the game the distinctiveness it
deserves.

            Finally, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-wall paddle games need to be
freed from ambiguity.  The problem arose when people
started employing the same wooden racket for
playing indoor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall handball</ENAMEX> that they used
outdoors against one wall.  Both games have been
referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">paddleball</ENAMEX> , although the ambiguity of
whether one is alluding to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-wall version or
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-wall version must always be resolved.  A solution
is suggested in my comments on racquetball:
racquetball , while officially referring to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-wall
game played with a strung paddle, would unofficially
also include the same sport played with a wooden
paddle; this would leave the term <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">paddleball</ENAMEX> as the
sole designation for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-wall game.

            Since other proposals for linguistic reform, such
as phonetic spelling and an international language
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esperanto</ENAMEX>), have never got off the ground, it could
be argued that we should forget such a minor matter
as changing the nomenclature of a cluster of games
played by only a small fraction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
However, times are changing and hope springs eternal.
In my view the chief obstacle to clearing up this
unfortunate onomastic mess is the inflexibility and
conservatism of those who dominate the official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>
of these racquet sports.  Until these people
can be convinced that communication is more important
than blind adherence to tradition the nebulousness
will continue.

            A number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami Beach</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX>
earned linguistic immortality, locally at least,
by announcing at a city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> meeting that he
had achieved the pinochle of success.  Everybody
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">laughed</ENAMEX>, but he just looked bewildered.  I laughed,
too, but I knew how he felt and why he confused a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">card</ENAMEX> game with a peak.  At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sometime</TIMEX>, probably
when he was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> or a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, he had read the
word pinnacle , figured out its pronunciation for himself,
and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">forever</TIMEX> after--although probably never using
the word out loud--thought of it as pinochle .

            Which of us is not guilty of the same crime--if
crime it is?  Which of us has not confidently used a
word for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, and then found out (probably in public,
to the sniggering of others) that it had another
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pronunciation</ENAMEX> altogether?  I am not talking about
simple preferences.  I say tomato, you say tomahto.
The television <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcer</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ca-RIB</ENAMEX>-be-yan; I prefer
Car<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">-i-BEE-yan</ENAMEX>.  I was raised (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> for being
brought up by one's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>) where the train <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>,
or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">depot</ENAMEX>, was the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">DEE-po</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of suhished
to hear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> say DEP-o.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of duhFENSE
may be introduced at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>
game, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> is shouting to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> on
the field, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúDEE-fense, DEE-fense!‚Äù</ENAMEX>

            Back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, upon reading of a forthcoming
astronomical event, I went out amongst the unlettered
and announced in the voice of one who knew,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúHalley</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comet</ENAMEX> is coming!‚Äù  I said it to rhyme with
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Haley</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tin Woodsman in The Wizard</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oz</ENAMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Bailey</ENAMEX> (as in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rumpole</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bailey</ENAMEX>).
Why not?  I had read about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halley's Comet</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, I
suspect, as a youngster; seeing the word in print, but
not having much occasion to shout it aloud (the
comet coming around only once every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75 years</TIMEX>), I
formed its pronunciation in my mind and there it
stayed.  Imagine my shame when I heard a TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcer</ENAMEX>
declare that one should rhyme <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halley</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally</ENAMEX>, rally , and tally (as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ho</ENAMEX> !).  Then up popped a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendant</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Halley</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who discovered
the comet; he said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> pronounces its
name to rhyme with holly, brolly (as in umbrella),
Good <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Golly</ENAMEX>, Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molly</ENAMEX> .  I consulted a dictionary
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 40 years</TIMEX> too late), and it sided with the TV
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">announcers</ENAMEX>.

            Another celestial word crisis arose when Voyager
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> began photographing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> planet.  I
approached an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> at my place of employment
and shouted: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúAt last!  We'll get a look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uranus</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>!‚Äù

            ‚ÄúI beg your pardon,‚Äù she said somewhat stuffily.
I had pronounced it yoor-ANUS, of course, as always.
To my chagrin, all the TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anchors</ENAMEX> came on the air
pronouncing it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YER</ENAMEX>-in-us, making it sound as though
it were part of a procedure designed to produce a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specimen</ENAMEX> in a bottle.  At this, I consulted the dictionary
again and learned that while their version was
preferred, a pronunciation similar to mine (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">yoo-RAY-nus</NUMEX>)
was listed as an option.  Checking around, however,
I found that a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> said it as I said it, so
that, as headlines began to blare such threats as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúScientists Probe Uranus</ENAMEX>,‚Äù proctological jokes proliferated.

            In a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miami Herald</ENAMEX> column I admitted my confusion
about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uranus</ENAMEX> and added that I was
guilty of even greater ignorance.  For instance, I was
well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past 30</TIMEX> when I was reading an advertisement
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">aloud: ‚</ENAMEX>ÄúDo you suffer the painful humiliation of psoriasis?‚Äù
Fortunately, I did not, but I suffered humiliation
enough when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listener</ENAMEX> pointed out that the
word was not pronounced sore-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ee</NUMEX>-AY-sis.  Again, I
had <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> read the word as a grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">schooler</ENAMEX>, assumed
its pronunciation, never asked about it and never
looked it up.  Since we are on the subject of humiliation,
here's another: I suffered great anxiety for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> after learning the correct pronunciation of
anxiety , which I had glibly been pronouncing
ANKS-ity.

            My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> insisted to his dying day that he
would never live in ‚Äúa God-damned condimonium.‚Äù
He rhymed it with pandemonium ; judging from the
lawsuits which proliferate over <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">condominium</ENAMEX> parking
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spaces</ENAMEX>, balcony barbecues, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets pooping</ENAMEX> in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, he might have been right to use the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neologism</ENAMEX>.

            A high school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pal</ENAMEX> of mine broke up a class by
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">reading: ‚</ENAMEX>ÄúRoman <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> built fires in their brassieres.‚Äù

            Etymology as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Educated Guess</ENAMEX>



            So spectacularly successful were the philologists
of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 19th</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 20th centuries</TIMEX> in
working out the lineages of words that the typical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionary user</ENAMEX> takes etymology for granted.  This is
made clear to me every time someone discovers that
I am a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúword man‚Äù</ENAMEX>--that I am an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Regional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and write a column
about word histories in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Inevitably,</ENAMEX>
I am presented with a favourite lexical curiosity and
asked where it came from.  This reveals <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> assumptions:
that I am a walking <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dictionary</ENAMEX> and that the
word's history will of course be known.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etymologies</ENAMEX> can be divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types.  The
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> involves words whose histories lend themselves
to philological principles or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúrules‚Äù of linguistic
change.  These rules describe the systematic transformation
of a prehistoric Indo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> root into
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin</ENAMEX> then <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> then into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> or into a Germanic
form then into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  There is, for example,
no uncertainly about the derivations of matrimony
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> , both from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> * matter
meaning `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>,' the former through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman French</ENAMEX> and the latter through a Germanic
root.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> type amounts to what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomfield</ENAMEX> calls a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúresidue‚Äù</ENAMEX>--words that cannot be
accounted for by neo-grammarian formulas.  The
histories of these words are generally more recent,
rarely reaching back to to proto-language, and are
anomalous in some way, deriving, for example, from
a historical incident or the name of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>.  They
are also often slang or colloquial in nature and therefore
tend to be poorly documented.  These etymologies
rise out of the gray area of word derivation that
employs educated guessing and cultivated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sprachgef√ºhl.</ENAMEX>
            

            A large number of the etymologies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Regional English</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARE</ENAMEX>) fall
into this latter category.  The evidence for a given
dialect expression is often very meager, and a good
guess at the etymology is about all that can be expected.
For example, a single <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> informant
used fatpoke meaning a `fat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>,' which one
might reasonably guess derives from analogy with
slowpoke , or it may also be an r -less pronunciation
and figurative use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat pork</ENAMEX> , a dialect name for `fat
back' or `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt pork</ENAMEX>.'  A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">informant</ENAMEX> used dog
weather for `hot, rainless weather,' which may derive
from the expression dog days referring to dry
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> weather.  Knocked for a feather meaning
`greatly surprised' could be a humorous blend of
knocked for a loop and knocked over with a feather ,
just as fleazy is perhaps a blend of flea and sleazy .  To
go on a bilge or drinking spree used by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">informants</ENAMEX> is perhaps an alteration of to go on a
binge , or perhaps a punning alteration, or perhaps a
pronunciation variant, with l substituted for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> , as in
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">chimney/chimley .</ENAMEX>  For lack of evidence, all of these
derivations are essentially guesses.

            Even where there is more evidence of a world's
usage a good guess at the etymology is about all that
can be made.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foot</ENAMEX> as an interjection expressing irritation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">(‚ÄúOh</ENAMEX>, foot, I've lost my glasses again‚Äù) is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southernism</ENAMEX> first recorded in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1953</TIMEX> issue of The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> .  It might originally be from the obsolete
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interjection Christ</ENAMEX>'s foot! , though the latest citation
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> is dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1662</TIMEX>.  Or it may be from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> interjection foutre! `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fuck it</ENAMEX>!'
            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> word for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äútemper tantrum</ENAMEX>,'
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hissy (‚ÄúShe</ENAMEX> had a hissy when I told her she couldn't
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">go‚Äù</ENAMEX>), first recorded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1934</TIMEX>, has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> plausible derivations.
It could be a hypocoristic or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>-talk form
of hysterical , or it might be from the imitative word
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hiss</ENAMEX> ; or perhaps it is a variant of another dialect
term, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jesse</ENAMEX> , meaning a `severe scolding,' which is
probably from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biblical</ENAMEX> allusion.  In any case, these
explanations are really only educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guesses</ENAMEX>.

            There is also the learned guess, as in the etymology
for groundhog , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midland</ENAMEX> name for the eastern
woodchuck, which may be a calque from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch</ENAMEX>
aertoercken , and archaic variant of aardvarken , literally
`earth <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>'; or hieronymous , a euphemism for the
posterior, which may derive from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> hieron osteon ,
the name for the sacrum; or the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appalachian</ENAMEX>
expression to come out of the little end of
the horn meaning `to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unlucky</ENAMEX>,' which is probably
an allusion to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúreverse‚Äù cornucopia</ENAMEX>.

            Because the historical record is typically spotty
at best, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> usually has to deal with a
larger `gray area' than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of a general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionary</ENAMEX>.
For example, in working on the etymology
for ofay , a derogatory term for a white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> used
by urban black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>, I discovered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> possible
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etymologies</ENAMEX>--all problematic.  The most popular explanation
is that ofay is pig <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foe</ENAMEX> .  But there is
simply no tradition or precedent in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afro</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
culture for the use of pig <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>.  Another version,
propounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.L. Mencken</ENAMEX>, among others,
claims that it is from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> aufait meaning `mastery'
presumably introduced via <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX>.  But
none of the early citations locates the word in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX>
and the semantic development from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> is very difficult.  An <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> is often
suggested.  Yoruba ofe meaning `a charm enabling
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to jump very high or disappear' and `to disappear'
was proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederic Cassidy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARE</ENAMEX> , but the semantics are very problematic.  Alternatively,
a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1932</TIMEX> article in the journal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Africa</ENAMEX>
claims an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Ibibio</ENAMEX> word, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afia</ENAMEX> , meaning `white or light-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coloured</ENAMEX>'
is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.  But this cannot be
confirmed.  The late appearance of ofay in print
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1925</TIMEX>) casts doubt on its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> origin.  By contrast
buckra , also a derogatory term for a `white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>,'
is first recorded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1787</TIMEX> and is probably from an Efik
word meaning `he who governs' and `white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.'

            Not just dialect words, but a great many of the
so-called ‚Äúresidue‚Äù words in standard speech have
conflicting etymologies.  This has become very clear
to me when written the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúWord Histories‚Äù</ENAMEX> column in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last three years</TIMEX>.  Recently in
that column I discussed the origins of the ubiquitous
teen usage, dude meaning `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX>.'  We know that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dude</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appeared in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1883</TIMEX>, probably in connection
with the ‚Äúaesthetic movement.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Oscar Wilde</ENAMEX>, the
high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> whose adherents cultivated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eccentricity</ENAMEX> in dress and affectation in speech
and manner, came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1882</TIMEX> on a lecture
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tour</ENAMEX> and presented in the flesh the image of an aesthete.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dude</ENAMEX> might have been coined to refer to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilde</ENAMEX> and his imitators.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Partridge</ENAMEX> suggests that
it is coined from dud an `article of clothing' altered
to incorporate attitude with reference to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dude</ENAMEX>'s
self-conscious manner or pose.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.T. Onions</ENAMEX> proposed
that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dude</ENAMEX> derived instead from Low German
dude a `foolish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX>' shortened from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">duden-kop</NUMEX> a
`lazy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX>,' literally `drowsy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>.'  In this sense,
the development of dude would be like that of fop .
Again we see etymologists struggling with uncertainty
and the educated guess.

            Often I try to include several proposed versions
of a word's origin in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúWord Histories‚Äù</ENAMEX> column.
This seems to encourage word <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buffs</ENAMEX> to take a stab at
their own versions--a popular pastime if the many
letters I receive are any indication.  When I missed a
good alternative guess at the origin of cold turkey
referring to a drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addict</ENAMEX> who quits abruptly, I received
numerous letters from would-be etymologists
correcting me.  I had argued, as does the unabridged
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Dictionary</ENAMEX> , that to quit or go cold turkey
probably developed from to talk cold <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> , a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variant of</ENAMEX> to talk <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> , that is, to speak bluntly
about something unpleasant.  The underlying or
transitional concept is presumably unfeeling abruptness.
The most authoritative of the letters I received
countering my explanation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúcold turkey‚Äù</ENAMEX> came
from an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">M.D.</ENAMEX> who said that ‚Äúthe expression alludes
to the `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gooseflesh</ENAMEX>' or `<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck bumps'</ENAMEX> that appear on
the skin of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> withdrawing from addiction to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">opiates</ENAMEX>.  The nodular appearance is that of the skin
of a plucked, uncooked, cold <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  This sounds
very plausible, though impossible to prove.  However,
these are not mutually exclusive explanations.
The phrase could have come from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúto talk cold turkey‚Äù
and was transferred to drug withdrawal because
the underlying image of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">horripilated</ENAMEX> naked
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">turkey</ENAMEX> was memorable.

            I have written about many other examples of
disputed word histories in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A History of English in Its</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Own Words</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HarperCollins</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>) that illustrate the
role of the educated guess.  But if etymological uncertainty
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perplexes</ENAMEX> and frustrates <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>, at the
popular level it makes writing and reading about
word histories fun.  Playing with the words of ‚Äúuncertain
origin‚Äù is like solving a puzzle: at its most
imaginative but speculative worst, it amounts to a
guess founded on assumptions and other guesses;
and at its best, it is the formulation of a plausible
solution based on a handful of genuine if limited
clues that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX> also amount to a guess, albeit an
informed and educated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.
         
         

            ‚ÄúAbusing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVIII,3</NUMEX>] reminded
me of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> lines that could be interpreted in a way
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bard</ENAMEX> might not have intended.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friar Laurence</ENAMEX>
says to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Romeo:</ENAMEX>

Go, get thee to thy love as was decreed
Ascend her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>--hence and comfort her.

[<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Romeo and Juliet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">iii</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">146-7</ENAMEX>]
            

            If the decree is a reference to the wedding
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vows</ENAMEX>, could he not be directing <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Romeo</ENAMEX> to consummate
the marriage?


         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert M. Sebastian</ENAMEX> does a good job of ‚ÄúAbusing
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">English‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVIII,3</NUMEX>].  Permit me two
other quotations from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bard</ENAMEX>:

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Native American Culture and ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù Nicknames</ENAMEX>



            Athletic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> nicknames have delighted and inspired
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> for more than a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>.  Yet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> a few of them--specifically those
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>--find themselves
at the center of a surprisingly bitter controversy.
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>, tribal team names set
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> apart from the rest of humanity--romantically
projecting them into the mythic past (along
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trojans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vikings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pirates</ENAMEX> , and the like) or else
degrading them to the cartoonlike level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mud</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Hens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Gophers</ENAMEX> , and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fabulous beasts</ENAMEX>.  In
effect, a living <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> is reduced to a bold-faced caricature.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX>, for their part, have objected
less to tribal nicknames per se than to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tom-tom</ENAMEX>-thumping pregame pageants and war-whooping
halftime shows they so often give rise to.
Such spectacles, they contend, make a lurid mockery
of their tribal rituals.

            Are tribal team names (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braves</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Redskins</ENAMEX>,
Seminoles , etc.) truly demeaning to red <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>?
Or do they, as their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> maintain, actually
preserve the heritage of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>?  Despite its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">air</ENAMEX> of implausibility and apparent unreality, this issue
is more than just a tempest in a teepee or a war
over words.  Instead, it raises serious questions of
racism and bigotry and, by treading in the area of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sports</ENAMEX>, cuts at the heart of some of our best-loved
cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>.  Ironically, it also touches on an
important aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> culture, for nicknaming
has long been a familiar custom--and even a cherished
tradition--among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>.

            Indeed, from the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX>,
from the Everglades to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> have long been renowned for their love of
rollicking nicknames.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>, for example,
used to delight and amaze early <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX> with their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">resonant</ENAMEX> and evocative names--names that, when
translated, turned out to have much of the broad
humor and graphic wit of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>-style nicknames.
Often comical ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sleeping Rabbit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey Leg</ENAMEX> ),
occasionally thrilling ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High Hawk</ENAMEX> ), and sometimes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bizarre</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rectum</ENAMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> names generally tried to
capture in a concise way the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX>'s
unique personality and style.

            In addition to having colorful personal names,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> exchanged actual nicknames too.  According
to anthropologists, the practice originated as a superstitious
form of self-protection and disguise.  The
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> nicknames were apparently primitive aliases.  In
the belief that knowledge of another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s real
name gave <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> magical power over that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>,
early tribal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> often concealed their true
names beneath protective layers of pseudonyms.
Even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, nicknames sometimes serve as a protective
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">shield</ENAMEX> (as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fats</ENAMEX> , for example, might protect an
obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> from even worse insults).  Like an inoculation,
a nickname is a minor injury that wards off
more serious harm.  And though it would later
evolve into a kind of sport or game--a playful pastime
in which braves showed off their flair for wisecracks
and verbal whimsy, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native nicknaming</ENAMEX> was
still predicated on the idea that an apt name can,
almost literally, capture a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s inner spirit.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nicknames</ENAMEX>, in short, mingled old superstitions
with tongue-in-cheek sophistication.  To this day, for
example, we cannot be sure whether it was primitive
fear or mischievous humour that inspired a famous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> to introduce herself to white people
by her nickname ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pocahontas</ENAMEX> , which provocatively
suggests `<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wanton Valley</ENAMEX>' or `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wild Place'</ENAMEX>) rather than
by her demure real name, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matowaka</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Snowflake</ENAMEX>.'

            Once he mastered the art, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX>
fired his mirth-tipped arrows at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foe</ENAMEX> alike.
And while he scored some memorable bull's-eyes on
his fellow red <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> (for example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mohawks</ENAMEX> --
`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eaters</ENAMEX>'--were given their blood-thirsty epithet
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy tribes</ENAMEX>), he nevertheless reserved his
choicest zingers for the invading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Algonquian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> called the first white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX>
Coat-wearers in gentle mockery of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stranger</ENAMEX>'s curious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">garb</ENAMEX>.  Did not these savage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newcomers</ENAMEX>
(another popular epithet), bound up in their
tight-fitting sleeves, buttons, and collars, appreciate
the superior comfort and versatility of blankets?
Bluecoats , the common <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Plains Indian</ENAMEX> nickname for
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> cavalry troopers, expressed similar sartorial
doubts out west.  At the same time, the cavalry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sabre</ENAMEX>, a much-coveted battle trophy, gave rise
to the alternative nickname of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Knives</ENAMEX> , a sobriquet
that combined light-hearted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jeering</ENAMEX> with wary
respect.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tribes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> and along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX>
called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jesuit missionaries Black Robes</ENAMEX> in yet another
nickname related to outlandish apparel.  A recent
movie makes the name seem ominous but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>
probably considered the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> more ridiculous
than sinister.  Since tribal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> preferred to
make brightly colourful fashion statements and generally
wore only custom-designed originals, they regarded
uniform clothing, particularly of a dark and
somber hue, as exceedingly odd.

            After <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Civil War</ENAMEX>, the reorganized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Army</ENAMEX>
contained a few all-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Negro</ENAMEX> regiments.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>
called these black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men Buffalo Soldiers</ENAMEX> apparently
because their woolly hair reminded the red <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">buffalo</ENAMEX> fur.  The troopers, for their part, enjoyed the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithet</ENAMEX> and accepted it as a good-natured tribute.

            In a particularly fanciful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">metonym</ENAMEX>, the Narragansetts
referred to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puritans</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wood</ENAMEX>-burners .

            Observing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Englishmen</ENAMEX> cut down entire forests to
obtain firewood, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> reasonably concluded
that a shortage of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> must have driven these wancomplexioned
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to their shores.  Had this cold-natured
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tribe</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> wondered, used up every
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last twig</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>-stump, and stick of firewood in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>
and come to the New World in search of more?

            Although white <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have tended to ignore
or downplay this joyful side of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> culture,
the fact remains that boisterous name-calling and irrepressible
nicknaming was at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time as popular
among the so-called <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nations</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civilized</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tribes</ENAMEX> as among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Eight</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ten</ENAMEX> football fans
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.  Contrary to the views of sentimentalists, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> long conditioned to satirical, hard-edged
personal names like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stumbling Bear</ENAMEX> , who have suffered
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five centuries the misnomer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> and
who once merrily referred to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Long Noses</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palefaces</ENAMEX> , are hardly likely to be mortified by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redskinsor</ENAMEX> devastated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braves</ENAMEX> .  Although currently
considered the most glaring of all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> team
names, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redskins</ENAMEX> actually predates its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX> usage
by some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-five centuries or so</TIMEX>.  The ancient
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> first coined the term and applied it to
the ruddy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> of the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>.
They called this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> Phoenicians (from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
Phoinikes , `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Red Ones</ENAMEX>' or `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Crimson Men</ENAMEX>') on account
of their sunburned skin.

            An interesting consequence of this aboriginal
foundness for nicknaming is that several of the oldest
and best-known <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> names can trace their
deepest roots--and in some cases their actual origins--to
the exploits and linguistic customs of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> themselves.  Though the exact date
of their birth is uncertain, team nicknames originnated
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> sometime before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil</ENAMEX>
War.  They were in any case in popular use well before
they were officially adopted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1871</TIMEX> by the
original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association of Professional</ENAMEX>
Baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Players</ENAMEX>, the world's first fully professional
baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX>.  A charter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> picked the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ft. Wayne Kekiongas</ENAMEX>
and thus became, for better or worse, the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sports</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> to adopt an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> nickname.

            
               Kekiongas was apparently chosen more for its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">poetry</ENAMEX> and local color than for any drollery or satire
at the expense of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX>.  To this day historians
are unsure what those resonant syllables
actually mean.  It had originally been the name of a
vast <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> that used to stand between the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maumee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Joseph Rivers</ENAMEX> near present-day
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ft. Wayne</ENAMEX>.  The entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> was reportedly destroyed
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1790</TIMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northwest Indian</ENAMEX> wars.
According to local legend, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kekionga</ENAMEX> means `Blackberry
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Patch</ENAMEX>,' presumably an apt description of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ft. Wayne</ENAMEX> area at the time red <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> first settled
there.  A more colourful and allusive translation,
however, is `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Place of the Clipped Heads</ENAMEX>,' a reference
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX>'s well-known fondness for bold,
highly decorative punk-style haircuts.  If this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eymology</ENAMEX> is correct, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clipped Heads</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX>'s
own self-styled nickname, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ft. Wayne Kekiongas</ENAMEX>
(or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúBare Scalps‚Äù as we might call them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>)
in essence preserved a tradition of verbal humor
and nameplay that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> themselves had
cheerfully begun.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keks</ENAMEX> , by the way, won <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> official major league ballgame, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-0</ENAMEX> over the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland Forest Citys</ENAMEX> .  Unfortunately, the team
folded--financially and competitively--later in the
season.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National League</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Braves</ENAMEX>
became the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> major league <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> to adopt a
tribal nickname.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> had previously been
known by the memorable designation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beaneaters</ENAMEX> ,
which, in a curious way, might also be considered an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> nickname.  That is because long before it became
a popular name for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, warlike
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tribes</ENAMEX> had used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Beaneaters</ENAMEX> as a derisive epithet
for peace-loving agrarian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>.

            Perhaps the most famous--and certainly the
most improbably begotten--of all tribal team names
made its official major league debut in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1915</TIMEX>.  At that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American League Cleveland</ENAMEX>
Naps , faced with the defection to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX>'s inspirational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, the eponymous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Napoleon ‚ÄúNap‚Äù Lajoie</ENAMEX>, held a city-wide contest to
select a new nickname.  The surprise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> .
According to press-box history and grandstand
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">legend</ENAMEX>, the name was a belated tribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lou</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúChief‚Äù Sockalexis</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX> to
play professional <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>.  Sockalexis, a full-blooded
Penobscot, played right field for the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Spiders</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National League</ENAMEX>.  During the years
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1897-99</TIMEX>, he and his identically monickered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teammate</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles ‚ÄúChief‚Äù Zimmer</ENAMEX>, helped the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spiders</ENAMEX>
maintain a league-wide reputation for rowdy, dust-raising,
bowl-'em-over <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>.  Indeed, the two
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúChiefs‚Äù</ENAMEX> practically personified <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Spider</ENAMEX> baseball during
that period--which could be the reason why opposition
hecklers started referring to the ballclub as
a bunch of ‚Äúwild <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  After a while, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> grew accustomed to the epithet and began using
it themselves, gradually converting it into an unofficial
nickname.

            Fond memories of those free-spirited <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Spider</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> were apparently running through the minds of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> when the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1915</TIMEX> nickname contest
was held.  At any rate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> somehow won
out--inspired, supposedly, by a rough-and-tumble,
crowd-pleasing red <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> whose exciting playing career
was unfortunately cut short by a series of
scrapes, off-field misadventures, and episodes with
the bottle.  Ironically, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Indians</ENAMEX> , a name of
no joy among red <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, may be the only
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shrine</ENAMEX> and surviving legacy of this memorable <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>.

            For most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX>, tribal names have been
the most popular nicknames in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> sports.  In
recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, however, their number has begun to
decline, most by having succumbed to inevitable
changes in taste and fashion, a few by having fallen
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Black Robes</ENAMEX> of political correctness.
One unfortunate casualty of this trend is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hurons</ENAMEX> , until
recently the vibrant and storied nickname of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan University</ENAMEX> and a name rich in authentic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> lore.  Deriving from an old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> word,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hur√©</ENAMEX> , meaning `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bristly</ENAMEX>' or `stubbled,' the epithet was
originally coined by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX>, hard-living,
robust <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellows</ENAMEX> who trapped and hunted in the vicinity
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Frenchmen</ENAMEX> applied the
term to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iroquois</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> of that region on
account of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX>' barbarous appearance and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rough-cut</ENAMEX> hair.  In effect, the name was an ironic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compliment</ENAMEX>, a friendly jest passed from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> scruffy
and uncouth <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> themselves were
hardly known for their dainty manicures and designer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coiffures</ENAMEX>) to another.  And the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> appreciated
it as such.  Before long they were proudly
calling themselves <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hurons</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Roughnecks</ENAMEX>' or `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rugged</ENAMEX>
Ones' and the nickname stuck.  It has served as a
semi-official tribal designation ever since.

            Nicknaming, it seems fair to conclude, is an activity
that has long delighted and entertained all
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>--white, colored, hyphenated, and just
plain--and the fiercely contested clash over ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nicknames</ENAMEX> appears to be largely due to overzealous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">activism</ENAMEX> and misdirected social reform.  A
sense of humor has been notably absent from the
battlefield.  Yet humor, as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vine Deloria, Jr.</ENAMEX>, once observed, is absolutely vital
to both the continuation and appreciation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
culture:


When a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can laugh at themselves and
laugh at others and hold all aspects of life together
without letting anybody drive them to

survive.

            Images of English
            Anyone interested in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language
ought to read this book; furthermore, it is a reasonably
safe prediction that it will prove readable, enjoyable,
and informative.  From the perspective of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of English at a noted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> university
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Bailey</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Dialect Society</ENAMEX> who has long been active
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> linguistics and associated with lexicography,
has provided a historical view of the development
of the language that concludes with a
realistic assessment of its present position among the
languages of the world.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> headings offer succinet clues to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bailey</ENAMEX>'s approach: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> Discerned; Emergent
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">English; English Abroad; World English; English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transplanted; Postcolonial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English; English</ENAMEX> Improved;
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Imaginary English; English Imperiled</ENAMEX>; and
Proper <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>.  To gain access to much of the material
presented one would have to ransack innumerable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recondite</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>; certainly, it would be difficult
to select and organize it so effectively and palatably.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bailey</ENAMEX> writes well.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the structural features to
be particularly savored in each chapter is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s
system of broaching his subject, describing it
lucidly, then illustrating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">attitudes (‚Äúimages‚Äù</ENAMEX>)
perceived by citing passages from prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX>.
These extracts, which are in chronological
order, have been well selected for clarity and
interest; neither cryptically brief nor tediously long,
they accurately reflect the opinions on, for example,
World <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>--the spread of English and its emergence
as a lingua franca--dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1846 to 1990</TIMEX>;
comments on Proper <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> are reflected in extracts
dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1711 to 1986</TIMEX>.

            Throughout, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bailey</ENAMEX> properly maintains the
clinical view of the scholarly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX>, and I could
find little evidence, even in the selection of extracts,
indicating where his personal preferences lie.

            Each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> in Images of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> could
stand on its own as an outstanding essay.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People</ENAMEX>
who are concerned that the vibrant vitality of English
is diminished by its aberrant spelling, reliance
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">idiom</TIMEX>, and inconsistent, ambiguous grammar may
derive consolation (but little pleasure) from the attempts
to codify the language as described in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
Improved.  Notwithstanding my personal speculations
about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s sentiments on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúimprovements‚Äù</ENAMEX> discussed, from spelling reform to
the reasonable/unreasonable acquiescence to the
pressures of feminism, I could find nothing that interferes
with his even-handed, detached description
of how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> feel about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>.  Many consider
themselves qualified to offer opinions about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
language in its multifarious manifestations, but,
as far as I am aware, no one has, till this book, taken
the trouble to engage in a comprehensive, comprehensible
review of those opinions.  That is not to say
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bailey</ENAMEX> has remained coolly aloof from his subject,
for everywhere the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> can sense the affectionate
warmth he brings to his subject.  The book
concerns itself, above all, with the attitudes and
opinions of others: though demonstrably capable of
the most uninvolved, scientifically analytical dissection
of an attitude, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bailey</ENAMEX> never slips into careless,
autoschediastic, personal commentary.

            Unencumbered by footnotes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Images</ENAMEX> of English
offers a good, but not overlong list of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">References</ENAMEX>, an
Index of Names, and a Subject Index.  My only cavil
is with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">compositor</ENAMEX>'s (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>'s, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proofreader</ENAMEX>'s)
apparent ignorance of the accepted hyphenation of
the word <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> : after, not before the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">-g-</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euphemism</ENAMEX> and Dysphemism
            Although this book contains much excellent material,
it suffers from a most serious shortcoming,
probably to be laid at the door of the publisher
rather than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>: it lacks an index of words
and phrases (which might have fit neatly into the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thirteen</ENAMEX> blank pages at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>).  The text is organized
into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> chapters titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúThe Lexicon for Bodily</ENAMEX>
Effluvia, Sex, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tabooed Body-Parts</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äù ‚ÄúEuphemisms</ENAMEX>

Insults, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Epithets</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Expletives,‚Äù</ENAMEX> and so on; without
a word and phrase index, access to particular
expressions is denied, thus reducing the usefulness
of the work.

            It ought to be self-evident from the subject matter
that those who are squeamish about seeing
‚Äúnaughty‚Äù words in print should avoid reading the
book, which is a longish monograph--the best and
most comprehensive I have seen--analyzing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> deal with taboo
words.  The treatment is clinical and contains much
useful ancillary information concerning usage, dialect,
and etymology (loo, crapper) , detailing the results
of considerable research, all of which is presented
along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>' commentaries and
speculations.  It is curious, though, to find so few
references in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bibliography</ENAMEX> to articles that have
appeared in, for instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maledicta</ENAMEX> , the main repository
of scatological analysis, and to such articles as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen Walker Read</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúYou Know What,‚Äù in American</ENAMEX>
Speech (reprinted in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">VERBATIM II</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Landau</ENAMEX>'s ‚Äú sexual intercourse in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American College</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictionaries‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I, 1</ENAMEX>].

            But to go back to the beginning, I think it is
agreed that euphemism is the deliberate substitution
of a socially acceptable, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúlaundered‚Äù term for one
that is considered taboo (for any reason at all--because
it is inappropriate to a given situation, irreligious,
antireligious, deprecatory, insulting, impolite,
indecorous, subversive, unpatriotic, slanderous,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prejudicial</ENAMEX>, and so forth).  The cultural perception
of what is taboo changes, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> avoidance
of a word like leg , to the current sanction of
television advertising of gear for the incontinent and
menstruating, to the blatant public discussion of
rape, incest, and other actions formerly anathema.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> define a euphemism as


an alternative to a dispreferred expression, in order
to avoid possible loss of face: either one's
own face or, through giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offense</ENAMEX>, that of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>, or of some <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>. [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p. 11</ENAMEX>]

The dispreferred expression may be taboo, fearsome,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distasteful</ENAMEX>, or for some other reason have
too many negative connotations to felicitously execute
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speaker</ENAMEX>'s particular communicative intention
on a given occasion.  [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p.14</ENAMEX>]

            

            The terms used here are not immediately transparent:
if by communicative intention is meant `denotative
purpose, the information the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> wishes to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">convey</ENAMEX>,' unless <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> views communication in the
broadest way, it would seem to me that the definition
confuses denotation with connotation; that is to
say, whether an expression is euphemistic, neutral,
or taboo is a matter of connotation, and the fact that
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> avoids shit for defecate, move one's bowels ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>, is purely a connotative matter: denotatively
(communicatively?) they all mean exactly the same
thing.  I can conclude only that that communicative
intention is used to mean both denotation and connotation:
but if that is so, then it would seem that the
contrast implicit in euphemism is lost.  Moreover,
‚Äúloss of face‚Äù is entirely irrelevant: if what is meant
is embarrassment , then why not call it that?  This curious
aspect is further explained in these terms: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúlest</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speaker</ENAMEX> lose face by offending <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hearer</ENAMEX>'s sensibilities‚Äù
[<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p. 12</ENAMEX>].  I am not persuaded that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> who
offends a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hearer</ENAMEX>'s sensibilities directly suffers loss of
face: loss of face could come about only by some
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retaliatory</ENAMEX> action of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hearer</ENAMEX>'s.

            Turning to dysphemism , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> provide the
following definition:


an expression with connotations that are offensive
either about the denotatum or to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>, or
both, and it is substituted for a neutral or euphemistic
expression for just that reason.  [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p. 26</ENAMEX>]
Dysphemisms, then, are used in talking about
one's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX>, things one wishes to show disapproval
of, and things one wishes to seem to downgrade.
[<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p. 27</ENAMEX>]

            

            In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part, I am not sure that one can say that
there is anything ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù about a denotatum: Is
there anything inherently offensive?  Is not the offensiveness
invariably--virtually by definition--in the
minds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>?  In any event, even these criteria
are abandoned later on in the book (e.g., in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter on ‚ÄúBodily Effluvia‚Äù</ENAMEX>) where, for example,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">john</ENAMEX>, jakes, bog, crapper are said to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äútend to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dysphemistic,‚Äù</ENAMEX> whatever that means.  What I am
getting at, to paraphrase the infinite wisdom of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pigs</ENAMEX>
is <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX> , is that shit is shit , and there is nothing
dysphemistic about it (unless used ‚Äúin talking about
one's opponents‚Äù)--that is, it is the context that determines
whether it is dysphemistic, which is again
dependent on whether it was the intention of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> to use a taboo word in place of socially acceptable
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.  In other words (to keep on explaining
this simple but hard-to-articulate point), in order for
an expression to be dysphemistic it must be the intention
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to employ it to an insulting, derogatory,
or otherwise offensive purpose.

            In a book dealing with a subject of this sort one
must be extremely careful to cleave to rigid definitions
of the key terms ( euphemism, dysphemism, taboo ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>) and not deviate from them.  Yet revenue
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">augmentation</ENAMEX> is described as a euphemism ‚Äúexcept
when it is used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to mean `raising
taxes,' which is taboo.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Taboo</ENAMEX> is here employed in
its loosest sense, quite a different one from that demanded
by the context of the book, and it would
have been better to have described raising taxes as a
term that is ‚Äúpolitically inexpedient‚Äù (itself a useful
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">euphemism</ENAMEX>).

            Nowhere could I find any comment on language
levels and the fact that euphemisms are seldom used
in certain contextual situations (e.g., among close
male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, in a team changing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prison</ENAMEX>).  Those who leave a social gathering to use
the toilet usually say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúExcuse me‚Äù</ENAMEX>; it might, depending
on the gathering, be acceptable to say, ‚ÄúI
have to powder my nose,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù ‚ÄúI gotta</ENAMEX> go (and when
you gotta go, you gotta go),<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äù ‚ÄúI</ENAMEX> have to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pee,‚Äù ‚ÄúI</ENAMEX>
have to take a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">leak/piss/crap/shit</ENAMEX>, etc.‚Äù but who
cares enough about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s temporary disappearance
to want to know its details?  Also absent is comment
on the borrowing of terms as dysphemisms (or
as euphemisms): for example, gurry is a neutral term
for the gut(s) (or, if you prefer, entrails) of an eviscerated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, but it becomes cynically dysphemistic
when used, as it is in medical slang, to refer to human
organs or parts removed in surgery.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> might also have discussed the deliberate
use of taboo words for their shock (or humor-inducing
embarrassment) value by so-called ‚Äúx-rated‚Äù
comedians, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> like the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenny Bruce</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Jerry</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sadowitz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Bloody Wilson</ENAMEX>: some of that humor
can be heard on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> television, where some
of the studio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> are evidently easily convulsed
by the mention of words like shit and fart .

            The most common forms of dysphemism occur
in the many terms used against ethnic and religious
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>, which need not be retailed here.  As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
point out, the taboos among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of English
occur mostly among terms for death, God, fear,
sex, lust, and bodily parts, to which one should add
bodily functions and, perhaps, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Euphemisms & Dysphemisms</ENAMEX> contains a vast
amount of valuable material, much of which is admittedly
hard to classify with any precision, for it
depends so much on context.  But that is not an excuse
for not trying.

            It is worth noting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> are both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX>,
and it cannot be denied that their views--
like anyone's--are influenced by their linguistic experience
and environment and by their age.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">From</ENAMEX>
their photograph, they would appear to be in their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thirties</ENAMEX>.)  A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>
of the same age or older or younger would be
bound to produce different descriptions and different
conclusions.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Anent ‚ÄúBeyond Compare‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OBITER DICTA</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>], let me throw another clod in the churn.  My
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">81 years old</TIMEX>; my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin</ENAMEX> is

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, but I say that I am his older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin</ENAMEX>
calls me an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>; but I insist that I am his
younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, a three-way disagreement.  However,
because of our oldness, we all agree that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perplexity</ENAMEX> should soon resolve itself.



         
         

            Referring to the review of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reception and Response</ENAMEX>
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BIBLIOGRAPHIA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>], I note the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX>'s problem
of understanding what is in the minds
of some who phone to radio call-in shows.  Let me
see if I can elucidate:

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caller</ENAMEX> says, ‚ÄúI'm a first-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller‚Äù</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Editor</ENAMEX>
comments that he has never fathomed the purpose
of this statement.  To get a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> (or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>) to
participate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first time</TIMEX> indicates a growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>) is made to feel good by
this, whether or not admitted publicly.  Though this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">caller</ENAMEX> has not called before, he is not a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listener</ENAMEX>.
He has learned enough about how broadcasting
works to know that the statement pulls just a little
extra attention from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caller</ENAMEX> says, ‚ÄúI really enjoy your program‚Äù or
‚ÄúYou really have a great program tonight.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  Pure</ENAMEX>
sycophancy, you say.  More nearly the opposite.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, for example, used to be so single-minded
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collier's</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saturday Evening Post</ENAMEX> , and
few others were all they needed.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s more
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">anarchic</NUMEX> times, nobody can count the numbers of
magazines needed to do the job.  Radio is the same.
Whatever subject a radio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> picks, he has targeted
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX>, lost others.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> in this instance
is really saying, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚ÄúYou</ENAMEX> targeted me <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX>,
and if you know what's good for you, pick subjects
like this more often, or I'm outta here.‚Äù

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caller</ENAMEX> says, ‚ÄúThank you for taking my call.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù Editor</ENAMEX>
says that is what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> is supposed to say.  But
the reference is not necessarily to that particular
call.  Sometimes all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lines</ENAMEX> are occupied.  The host
can read on his computer screen an indication, provided
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who screens the calls, of what a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> wishes to talk about.  More often than not, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> has only limited time: maybe a dull <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> can
be disposed of quickly; on the other hand, an interesting
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> might merit being continued after a
break for the news or a commercial.  Sometimes, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">caller</ENAMEX> has been holding on for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 minutes</TIMEX> or more
before getting in his quick remark, with the news
only <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">29 seconds</TIMEX> away.

            Imagine getting to express one's views to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX>--maybe
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX>
who says, ‚ÄúThank you for taking my call,‚Äù is the
gentle and courteous kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> one should have
more respect for.  And thank you for taking my
letter.



         
         
            [I am sure that, like me, there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> who appreciate
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX>'s well-reasoned demystification
of what seems to have become a private language.
As a frequent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> of letters to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Times</ENAMEX> and an
occasional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">periodicals</ENAMEX>, all of which
receive a great deal of mail, I can understand the
points made.  But, as the letter itself makes clear,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> does not write ‚ÄúThank you for publishing my
letter‚Äù in such correspondence, and the approach
still smacks to me of smarminess. --<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX>. ]
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Orbaum</ENAMEX> comments on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Version</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúmistranslation‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isaiah</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:14</TIMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>
almah as `virgin' [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>].  He fails to make explicit
that the portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew</ENAMEX> he quotes (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:23</TIMEX>) is not
just an identical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúmistranslation‚Äù</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew</ENAMEX>'s use of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> parthenos is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KJV</ENAMEX>'s authority for the
choice of word.

            Bible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> have, presumably, a latitude of interpretation
denied mere translators.  However,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew</ENAMEX> did not have to stretch the language here.
A better English match than `young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>' for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">almah</ENAMEX> is `maiden,' which, while it narrowly
means only `young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>,' certainly connotes virginity.
(See, for instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Knox</ENAMEX>'s translation
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Vulgate Latin</ENAMEX>.  Many languages have this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ambiguity</ENAMEX>.)

            Lacking the authority of either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Isaiah</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew</ENAMEX>,
most of us might well remember that while
the goal in writing is to avoid ambiguity, the goal in
translation should be to replicate it.

            On another point, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James II</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX> was king
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid 1400s</TIMEX>.  It was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James VI of Scotland</ENAMEX> who
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">became James I of England</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1603</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James VII</ENAMEX> (of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James II</ENAMEX> (of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>) became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1685</TIMEX> and was overthrown in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same year</TIMEX>.



         
         

            Further to the letter of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Muriel Smith</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>]
regarding gunsel , perhaps her taste and discretion
prevent her from quoting Queen more directly.  ‚ÄúIn
the Queen's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parlor‚Äù</ENAMEX> specifically refers to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammett</ENAMEX>'s
use of gunsel and describes him as meaning it in the
‚Äúcatamite‚Äù sense.  He also mentions ‚Äúa <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> kept for
unnatural purposes‚Äù in quoting from a pamphlet,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúHard-Boiled Detective Fiction</ENAMEX>,‚Äù by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Sandoe</ENAMEX>,
as his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.  I thank <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Herron</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glen Ellen</ENAMEX>,

City <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lights Press</ENAMEX>, for finding these citations.



         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Politicians</ENAMEX> can be such easy targets, but I
thought that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> might appreciate this
statement by former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin Meese</ENAMEX>
during an interview on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WBEZ</ENAMEX>, our local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">affiliate</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Public Radio</ENAMEX>:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the purposes of the primaries is for members
of political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> to sort out their differences
in the areas in which they agree.
            



         
         
            At last, what may be the definitive condemnation
of ‚Äúpolitically correct language‚Äù for the nonsense
that it is! [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OBITER DICTA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>] I, for one,
am proud to be an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unreconstructed linguistic traditionalist</ENAMEX>.
My generic<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-pronoun</ENAMEX> usage is defiantly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">masculine</ENAMEX>, my descriptions are bluntly factual, my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Trinity</ENAMEX> is and always will be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Son</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Ghost</ENAMEX>, world without end.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amen</ENAMEX>.

            The idiocy inherent in the hypersensitivity
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plague</ENAMEX> may perhaps be seen in an example which
occurred to me while reading this morning's sports
page.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Bears</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúRefrigerator‚Äù Perry</ENAMEX> is a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gentleman</ENAMEX> whose
weight is variously estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 350</NUMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> pounds.  His ancestors came from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>.  The
censors of the moment would have us refer to Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perry</ENAMEX> as (to use examples from OBITER DICTA) a
‚Äúnon-slim <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult male</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  This description
may be utterly inoffensive, but it is also so
lacking in color or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> that a sports-page editor
would reject it instantly.

            If this drivel carries through to its logical conclusion
we will have to stop writing and speaking
altogether, for there will not be a single noun or
adjective that will not be deemed offensive to some
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>, and if we cut speech down to simple verb
forms we will end up sounding like a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> of boot-camp
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">drill instructors: ‚ÄúCome!‚Äù ‚ÄúSit!‚Äù ‚ÄúAdd!‚Äù</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúPay!‚Äù ‚ÄúWrite!‚Äù Nor</ENAMEX> will there be any grunts in this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boot</ENAMEX> camp, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sir</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ma'am</ENAMEX> in Yes, Sir/
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma'am</ENAMEX> will be deemed exclusive and taboo; someone
will probably take offense at Yes or No , for that
matter.

            It seems to me that the political correctness
movement is a natural descendant of the recurrent
spasms of prudery that have assaulted our language
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the centuries</TIMEX>.  The Reverend <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowdler</ENAMEX> is no
doubt chortling in his grave.

            On another subject, lest a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> be misled into
assuming that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skeat</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX> by the facetious
heading, ‚ÄúThe Invariably <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Right</ENAMEX> Reverend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter W.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skeat</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OBITER DICTA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>], it should be pointed

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúEntitling‚Äù</ENAMEX> books and other works is an inferior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">usage</ENAMEX>, which I was surprised to find in VERBATIM
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>].  It means no more than the shorter word,
titled.  This usage muddies the distinction between
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> perfectly good words with their own meanings,
and I see no justification for it.  I call this practice
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúCosellism</ENAMEX>,‚Äù for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sportscaster</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Cosell</ENAMEX>, who
was always willing to use a bigger word that seemed
to mean the same as a smaller, even if it didn't
(which was often).  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cosell</ENAMEX> apparently legitimized the
habit for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>; from a recent issue
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>:

            [ <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Entitle and</ENAMEX> title , as transitive verbs meaning `give a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title to</ENAMEX>,' appear to be coeval, both given their earliest
citations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> .  Thus,
one is given a choice between them, a choice that
might be dictated by the style, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">meter</NUMEX>, and rhythm of
a sentence or by personal preference.  Context, of
course, enables us to distinguish between this and
the other meaning of entitle , `give (someone) a
right'; it is hard to see where the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> meanings
would conflict.  A similar notion surrounds the word
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">till</ENAMEX> , which many would suggest is a somehow less
formal shortening of until , the shortening of which is
properly written 'til .  As it happens, the original
form was till , with until being formed from unto `up
to' + till .  The citations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> , which are rather
thin on the ground for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 13th-century</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle</ENAMEX>)

the wooden form on which shoemakers build--or

the following errors seem to stand out:


‚ÄúIt makes beautiful.‚Äù  That is not <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, but
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Il fait beau</ENAMEX>).  In <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>, the expression is
hace <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">buen tiempo</ENAMEX>, the literal version of which
would be `it makes good time' (tiempo being the
word for `weather' as well as `time').

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> no tengo pelos en <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la lengua</ENAMEX>.  The expression does
not begin with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">conjunction y `</ENAMEX>and'; moreover,
the concept of ‚Äúnot having hair on one's tongue‚Äù
does not exactly mean `I'm telling what I think'
but rather `I'm telling it like it is' or `I'm not beating
about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX>.'

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equador</ENAMEX>.  Please!  The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s name is spelled

Hacer vaca.  In this case, `to play <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hooky</ENAMEX>' has nothing
to do with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX>: vaca is short for the word for
`vacation,' that is, if you're not in school you're
creating a vacancy, a void.

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dar</ENAMEX> zapatetas.  This is not `to give shoe slaps'; it is a
`jump for joy accompanied by a slap on (the upper
part of) the shoe.'

Sin ton ni <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>.  This is rendered as `without tone or
sound.'  Ton is not the word for `tone': it is not
even a standard <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> word, being a nonceword
in this expression, mainly for rhyme and euphony.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Son</ENAMEX> means `sound,' to be sure--but in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>!  In
this context, it means `beat, rhythm.'  The expression
means, literally, `without rhyme or rhythm,'
bearing in mind that, paradoxically, ton rhymes
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>.

A great many words in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quechua</ENAMEX> begin with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hua</ENAMEX>- or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">gua-</NUMEX> (used interchangeably), so when the hacienda

when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mami</ENAMEX> is persuaded that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> needs a new

make of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">plumber</ENAMEX> listed in the yellow pages under

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William B. Ober</ENAMEX>'s article, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúWriting Maketh</ENAMEX> an
Exact <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Man‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVIII,2</NUMEX>] was enjoyable not just--as in
all his work--for its quirky insights and elegant
style, but also--uncharacteristically--as an exercise
in irony.  The very title is a small masterpiece of
ironic wit, being a misquotation rather than an
accurate transcription from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacon</ENAMEX>'s essays.  As one
of the finest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Cultures researchers</ENAMEX> around--
medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> and literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ober</ENAMEX>
is certainly qualified to censure the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">under</NUMEX>-investigated
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assertions</ENAMEX>, careless citations, and flawed
proofreading he detects in the work of fellow
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>... and make himself a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostage</ENAMEX> to fortune
(to mis-cite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacon</ENAMEX> in my turn) when doing so.
Committing slip-ups of one's own, in other words,
while brashly reproving the slip-ups of others,
would tend to undermine one's moral position
somewhat.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ober</ENAMEX> has cleverly circumvented this
danger.  By adopting the ironic stance and
deliberately infiltrating many of his own whimsical
inaccuracies into his critique, he in effect preempts
at once the charge of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tu quoque</ENAMEX> .  Consider how he
balances that opening irony with a corresponding
subtlety at the very end of the article.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>
Routh, we read, advised an undergraduate, ‚ÄúAlways
verify your references, sir!‚Äù  A brief verifying of
one's references reveals that the wording here is
again misquoted and, furthermore, that the
recipient of the advice was almost certainly no
longer an undergraduate.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ober</ENAMEX> strews a variety of such booby-traps
along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trail</ENAMEX>: the teasing reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Sellars</ENAMEX>'
participation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amadeus</ENAMEX> , for example, and the
characterizing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Steiner</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pundit</ENAMEX>.  My own favorite coup <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">d'ironie</ENAMEX> occurs in the
paragraph on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Craft</ENAMEX>'s lapses: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúHe also refers
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mozart</ENAMEX>'s first love,‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ober</ENAMEX> notes with regret,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äúas Aloysius,‚Äù</ENAMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aloysia</ENAMEX> , that is (or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúAloyisia‚Äù</ENAMEX> as the article cunningly renders it!).

            Ironists run a continual risk: if they nudge too
hard and use too broad an irony, they risk sounding
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facetious</ENAMEX>; if they stay deadpan and use too subtle an
irony, they sound in earnest and risk being taken
literally.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swift</ENAMEX>'s ‚ÄúMeditation upon a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Broomstick</ENAMEX>,‚Äù
for instance, impressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Countess</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford</ENAMEX> as
deeply pious instead of hilariously parodic.  Perhaps
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ober</ENAMEX>, too, if I might venture a criticism at this
point, has edged beyond the critical angle of irony,
cutting it too fine in his approach and thereby
risking a literal reading.  Certainly I, for one, was
taken in at first by his solemn academic tone and
groaned at the prospect of having to write a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">moralizing corrective--‚ÄúEven Ober</ENAMEX> nods,‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúPhysician</ENAMEX>, heal thyself‚Äù--spare us!

            What saved me from falling into that trap was
the sudden recognition that he would never be so
presumptuous as to write an article exposing the
inadequacies of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>' researches while at the
same time allowing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</NUMEX> comparable lapses
of his own to remain unheeded and unweeded in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">expos√©</ENAMEX> itself.  Fortified with that realization, I went
back to the text and saw at once--even in the title--
that the straight-faced phrasing of the article was
really just a ruse, and that an ironic reading was the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> possible.

            A footnote to the verify-your-references
anecdote may interest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, since the two
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in that famously anticlimactic exchange
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Joseph Routh</ENAMEX>, then aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 92</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Burgon</ENAMEX>, then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 34</NUMEX>) are celebrated for
other reasons.  Here, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all, is the full story
(accurately quoted, I hope), as recalled by Burgon
some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35 years later</TIMEX>:

I ventured to address him somewhat as follows:

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúMr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, give me leave to ask you a question
I have sometimes asked of aged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>, but never
of any so aged or so learned as yourself.‚Äù  He looked
so kindly at me that I thought I might go on.  ‚ÄúEvery
studious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, in the course of a long and thoughtful
life, has had occasion to experience the special value
of some axiom or precept.  Would you mind giving
me the benefit of such a word of advice?‚Äù  He bade
me explain, evidently to gain time.  I quoted an
instance.  He nodded and looked thoughtful.
Presently he brightened up and said, ‚ÄúI think, sir,
since you care for the advice of an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, sir, you
will find it a very good practice‚Äù (here he looked me
in the face) ‚Äúalways to verify your references, sir!‚Äù

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Routh</ENAMEX> is still notable as one of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eccentrics</ENAMEX>.  He became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of Magdalen
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>, in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirties</TIMEX> and, since there was
no compulsory retirement age in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX>, clung
to that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> until his death, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1854</TIMEX>--at the age of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">99</TIMEX>!  His tenure of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63 years</TIMEX> as head of an Oxbridge
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">college</ENAMEX> must be a record.  He remained very much
an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> right through the middle of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th century</TIMEX>: he always wore a wig in public and
simply refused to believe that such a thing as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">railways</ENAMEX> could possibly exist.  Perhaps his most
engaging eccentricity was the way he reared his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>: he apparently brought it up to think of itself as
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>, to the point where it even used its paws to
wash its face.

            As for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burgon</ENAMEX>, who later in life became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean</ENAMEX> of
Chichester, he retains a tiny niche in the history of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> literature for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> immortal lines of poetry
he composed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1845</TIMEX>, much quoted and much
admired ever since.  They come from his poem
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúPetra</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which won him the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Newdigate</ENAMEX> prize at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>:

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>] cites cute as a button as a clich√© of
unexplained origin.  It looks like the
Americanization of bright as a button by somebody
who missed the point--the juggling with the two
meanings of bright `mentally alert' and `physically
shining.'  The button envisaged would be the
polished brass type, traditionally made in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Birmingham</ENAMEX>, which was fashionable at certain
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX> and standard on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Army</ENAMEX> uniforms until
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</TIMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> examples of this type of witticism
include, from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Jean Nathan</ENAMEX>'s Monks Are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monks</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX>), as bored as an oil-well and as swell as
the mumps .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Carroll</ENAMEX> provides a classic example: in
Through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Looking-Glass</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Knight</ENAMEX> relates
how he fell into his own helmet and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúit</ENAMEX> took <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>
and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> to get me out.  I was as fast as--as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lightning</ENAMEX>, you know.‚Äù  When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice</ENAMEX> objected, ‚ÄúBut
that's a different kind of fastness,‚Äù he replied, ‚ÄúIt
was all kinds of fastness with me, I can assure you!‚Äù


         
         
            I noted with interest the discussion of the word
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bungee</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVIII,2</NUMEX>].  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX>'s memory matches
mine with regard to the use of the fabric-covered
elastic for yachting and the use of the term shock
cord .  However, my familiarity with the material
goes back farther.  Prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, light
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aircraft</ENAMEX>, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Piper Cub</ENAMEX>, used the material,
referred to as shock cord or bungee cord , for the
landing-gear <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>.  This system can be seen on
aircraft of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX> vintage, but I do not know
what term was used then.  I am sure that a search of
the appropriate literature would reveal its early use,
for the rubber bands broke frequently, something
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> would complain about when writing their
memoirs.

            Also, in old photographs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">glider</ENAMEX> flying one can
see that the method used for launching was to have a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> stretch a long bungee attached to the
glider, which was held in place by others.  When the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anchor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the glider</TIMEX>, it flew into the air
like a model airplane launched by a rubber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>.
The captions of such photographs often refer to this
as a bungee launch .  While this does not help with
the question of the source of the word, it goes
further to indicate that bungee did not originate with
the current fad.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Mulroney</ENAMEX>, because of his tendency to change

but when asked about it later, he claimed that what

generally amused (though not deceived) by this humorous
explanation.  In fact, one of the less reputable
