            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the nineteenth century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age of Euphemism</ENAMEX>, the word unmentionables designated only one
specific referent--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s trousers.  Not only was the
mentioning of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s (or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s) leg taboo, but
the garment covering it was also forbidden to be
spoken of in polite conversation.  In modern dialogue,
which in no sense approaches the gentility of
the perfumed puritanicals, the denotation of unmentionables
has broadened to include body organs,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">curses</ENAMEX>, and biological functions.  How clever it is,
though, that metaphor, the great facilitating factor in
the changing of word meanings, has carefully camouflaged
the unmentionables of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the current day</TIMEX>.

            Consider the following vignette, apparently
void of any hint of an unmentionable:

            Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eleanor Sutherland</ENAMEX>, the vivacious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of
the petroleum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magnate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. R. Sutherland</ENAMEX>, is hosting
a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">midsummer</TIMEX> patio brunch with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of many a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grace Walthum</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Walthum</ENAMEX>,
considered by many to be the richest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in the
state, in honor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra Chapman</ENAMEX>, the young <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">debutante</ENAMEX> and intended <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Weed</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œGirls</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">treat</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> is avocado finger
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwiches</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fanny</ENAMEX> made them for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. R.</ENAMEX> thought they were simply
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sumptuous</ENAMEX>.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Only today</TIMEX>, she made them with German
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pumpernickel</ENAMEX>.  I do hope you like them.â€

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œOh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eleanor</ENAMEX>, you must pencil this off for me on
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of your personalized recipe cards.  These are
purely delicious.  Don't you agree, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra?â</ENAMEX>€

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œIndeed</ENAMEX>, I do.  I might serve them as hors
d'oeuvres for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX>'s political science seminar at the
university <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX>.â€

            â€œYou <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are testimony enough for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fanny</ENAMEX>'s culinary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">powers</ENAMEX>, although I do detest her slicing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> so thick.  After finishing off the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwiches</ENAMEX>,
we'll savor some vanilla mousse.â€

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œThat</ENAMEX>'s a lovely centerpiece of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bachelor</ENAMEX>'s buttons
and cowslips, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eleanor</ENAMEX>.  Wherever did you find
such exquisite <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>?â€

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œYes</ENAMEX>, and the cubicle you have them arranged
in is just gorgeous.â€

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œOh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardener</ENAMEX>, grew them on the
front lawn.  He's hoping to have mistletoe by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>,
and if the spring <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">orchids</ENAMEX> don't fizzle, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra</ENAMEX>
can use them in her nuptial ceremony.  By the way,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra</ENAMEX>, where will you and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom honeymoon?â</ENAMEX>€

            â€œWe're going to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tetons</ENAMEX>.  Then we're off to the ocean where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> says
he's going to swim stark nude.  Would you believe
it?â€

            At this moment, there is a disturbing noise
nearby.

            â€œJeepers creepers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eleanor</ENAMEX>, what is that whirring
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">commotion?â€</ENAMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œWhy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grace</ENAMEX>, look across the lawn to the orchard.
It's a feisty covey of flatulent partridges taking
flight.  Aren't they beautiful, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>?â€

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œTom</ENAMEX>'s greyhound would certainly think they
were a beautiful sight.â€

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œMy</ENAMEX>, how the time has slipped away.  We must
be going, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra</ENAMEX>.â€

            â€œOf course, we must, and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutherland</ENAMEX>, I
have so enjoyed being a part of such a stimulating
conversation.â€

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œGirls</ENAMEX>, it was my deepest pleasure.  Please do
come again.â€

            Actually, in the preceding dialogue, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> ladies
from the highest level of society can be cited for
innocently mentioning the unmentionables in no less
than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-plus instances, to wit:

            
               Avocado was borrowed from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> and was
originally spelled aguacate .  The word's origin is Nahuatl
ahuacatl , a word meaning `testicle,' because of
the similarity of the shape of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>.

            
               Pumpernickel was borrowed directly from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> of pumpern `to fart' and Nickel the
`devil.'  The allusion could be to a hand slapping the
loaf, thereby producing a deep, hollow, fartlike
sound.  On the other hand (pun intended), the root
sense might be implying the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> is so hard to digest
it would make the devil fart.

            
               Pencil (as well as penicillin ) was borrowed from
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> pÄ“nicillus `paintbrush,' a diminutive of peniculus
`brush,' which is also a diminutive of penis , which
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> (also) meant `tail.'  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Figuratively</ENAMEX>, a brush is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">penis</ENAMEX> is a tail.

            
               Seminar came through <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
sÄ“minÄrium `<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> nursery.'  The word's ultimate origin
is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> semen `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX>.'  Since the testicles are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX>
of semen, they are often referred to in slang
as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> .

            
               Testimony and detest are both based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
testis `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX>, testicle.'  In the final analysis, a man
can only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> to his virility by his testicles.  The
root sense of testimony , then, is `a laying of the testes
on the evidence table' and of detest is to `hate to the
extent of losing one's testicles.'

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vanilla</ENAMEX> , extracted from the seedpods of a tropical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX>, was borrowed from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vainilla</ENAMEX> , which
denoted the flower, the pod, or the flavoring.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Spanish</ENAMEX>
had formed vainilla from vaina `sheath,' a word it
had borrowed from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> vÄgina `sheath for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sword</ENAMEX>.' Later, vagina was borrowed into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
and assigned its present meaning from the similarity
of the functions.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bachelor</ENAMEX>'s buttons, a term that denotes a plant
with spherical-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, was created as a metaphor
of the male testes.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cowslip</ENAMEX> is not â€œcow's lip.â€  It is from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cÅ«slyppe `cow manure</ENAMEX>,' literally, `cow slip.'  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flower</ENAMEX> is aptly named, since it grows well in profusely
manured pastures.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubicle</ENAMEX> is from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> cubÄre `to bend over in
preparation for sexual activity.'  The word now
designates a space so small a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> might be required
to bend over to enter it.

            In its root sense, mistletoe is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">`bird</ENAMEX>-shit
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>.'  The word is cognate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old High German</ENAMEX>
mist `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">manure</ENAMEX>, shit, dung.'  The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> was
dispensed in the dung of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orchid</ENAMEX> is from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> orchis `testicle.'  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flower</ENAMEX> was so called by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pliny</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Elder</ENAMEX> because the
double root resembled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hairy testicles.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fizzle</ENAMEX> is probably from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle English</ENAMEX> fisten `to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fart</ENAMEX>.'  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1532</TIMEX> the word is recorded with the meaning
to `fart noiselessly.'

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Tetons</ENAMEX> is a mountain range in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX>.
They were coarsely named from their root
sense, `big tits,' from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> teton `tit,' because of
their shape.

            Stark nude is euphemistic for stark naked.  The
term was originally start naked (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">stert</ENAMEX>,
from Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> steart `tail, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ass</ENAMEX>') and is preserved in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">redstart `bird</ENAMEX> with red tail feathers.'

            Jeepers creepers is nothing other than a euphemistic
cover-up for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus Christ</ENAMEX>.  The term
was actually used as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early as 1937</TIMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feisty</ENAMEX>, like fizzle, began as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fysten</ENAMEX>,
fisten `to fart.' At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time, fysting curre referred
to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stinking dog</ENAMEX>, and feist named a small dog
of mixed breed.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Covey</ENAMEX>, like cubicle, is from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> cubÄre `to bend
over for sexual purposes.' The word came through
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle French</ENAMEX> cover `to incubate.'

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Flatulent â€œhaving stomach gasâ€</ENAMEX> came through
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> flatus `a farting.'

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Partridge</ENAMEX> came through Old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">perdÄ«cem</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pÃ©rdÄ«x `partridge</ENAMEX>,' which is
related to pÃ©rdesthai `to fart.'  The partridge is a
â€œfarting birdâ€ because of the noise made by its being
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flushed</ENAMEX>.

            Finally, the first element of greyhound probably
means `bitch.'  Old Icelandic greyhundr is `bitch
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hound</ENAMEX>.'

            Most will agree that euphemism is an acceptable
means of avoiding the unmentionables, unutterables,
inexplicables, ineffables, inexpressibles, and
whatever else they have been called.  While it is the
function of metaphor to conceal the unmentionables,
it is likewise the pleasurable business of etymology
to expose them.

[From an on-camera interview with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Evans</ENAMEX>, commenting
on <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">â€œNight of 100 Starsâ</ENAMEX>€ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> to

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œBest Place In Town To Take A Leak</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€</ENAMEX> [From an advertisement
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Conn.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Auto Radiator, Inc.</ENAMEX> in a local television
program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX>, ]

         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wrenches</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorse</ENAMEX> and Bracken



            It began innocently enough, without guile on my part.  We were traveling on an interstate through
flat, scraggly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.  Nothing seemed to grow at
the roadside except dry, brownish, stalky, weedy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brush</ENAMEX>.

            â€œWhat're those <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daddy?â</ENAMEX>€ a child
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">whined</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œGorse</ENAMEX>,â€ I said absently.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œGorse?â€</ENAMEX> said my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, raising an eyebrow.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œWell</ENAMEX>, then, what's that?â€ She pointed to a patch of
equally depressing but bushier shrubbery.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œBracken</ENAMEX>,â€ I said serenely.

            I had, I now believe, been reading an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
novel, or perhaps a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherlock Holmes</ENAMEX> adventure, and
so the words just popped out of my subconscious.
You know, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> novels <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and large
hounds are always chasing about on desolate moors,
amid gorse and bracken.  I hadn't the foggiest
idea--and haven't to this day--what gorse and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bracken</ENAMEX> look like.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œGorse</ENAMEX> and bracken,â€ my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> mused.  â€œAh yes,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX> of comedy.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laurel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbott</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costello, Gorse</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bracken</ENAMEX>.â€

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œGorse</ENAMEX> and bracken, gorse and bracken,â€
chanted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> gleefully.

            A bit farther down the road we halted for lunch
at a roadside rest stop.  My youngest pointed to a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bird</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">said: â€œWhat</ENAMEX>'s that, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daddy?â</ENAMEX>€

            Perhaps I was thinking of car repairs, for the
engine had been making odd noises.  Whatever the
reason, without a blink I replied: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œIt's a Wrench</ENAMEX>.â€
The lie came to my lips just as easily as to the lips of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Goebbels</ENAMEX>.  Then, to my horror, without waiting
for another childish question, I pointed to a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crawling caterpillar</ENAMEX> and said glibly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œLook</ENAMEX>.  There's
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squirm</ENAMEX>.â€

            I had embarked on a life of deceit involving the
names of nature's own <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX>.  Perhaps I
had an unconscious recollection of seeing, long ago,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Thurber</ENAMEX>'s delightful drawings of such creatures
as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Dudgeon and The Barefaced Lie</ENAMEX> in his
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œA New Natural History</ENAMEX>.â€  If so, I didn't make the
connection for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, and prefer to believe that great
minds,... et cetera.

            Anyway, to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> became Gorse
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bracken</ENAMEX>.  All <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wrenches</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Worms</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX>, and such were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Squirms</ENAMEX>.  I didn't disillusion
them.  Instead, I confess with shame, I found that
merely misleading my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> was not enough.
Since I lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Florida</ENAMEX>, where real tropical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exotica</ENAMEX> abound (poisonous toads, walking <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">catfish</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-foot-long</NUMEX> green lizards from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>, etc.) it was
easy to flummox <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œGosh</ENAMEX>,â€ my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother-in-law</ENAMEX> said, peering apprehensively
into the dark of my back yard, a subtropical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jungle</ENAMEX>, â€œit sounds like we're in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>.  What's
that ... growly sort of chirping sound?â€

            â€œI believe that's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Strike</ENAMEX>,â€ I said.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œA bird</ENAMEX> related
to the macaw.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€ Cupping</ENAMEX> a hand to my good
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ear</ENAMEX>, I added, â€œYes, I'm sure of it.  A common Strike.
It has a predatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Preemptive Strike</ENAMEX>.â€

            â€œIs that so?â€ my brother-in-law muttered, with
some awe in his voice.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX> always demanded a visit
to the nearby tourist attraction, a lush, tropical paradise
populated by trained <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parrots</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">alligators</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">colorful insects</ENAMEX> and such.  So I took them.

            â€œSee that curious little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beast</ENAMEX> over there?â€ I said,
pointing.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œThat</ENAMEX>'s a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peccadillo</ENAMEX>.  His armor, like a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shell</ENAMEX>, over most of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, and great long claws to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dig</ENAMEX> in the ground.  And there, climbing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>--
the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">blue lizard</ENAMEX>, see it?--that's an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orthodontia</ENAMEX>.
The striped one--see it?--is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharisee</ENAMEX>.  Or, wait,
maybe that's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paraphrase</ENAMEX>.  Whatever.  It's larger
than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stentorian</ENAMEX> at any rate.â€

            With practice, I became bolder, mixing in the
names of real <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX>.

            â€œA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> of ours used to own a ring-tailed
coatimundi,â€ I said.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œIt</ENAMEX> would escape and climb our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ficus Benjamina</ENAMEX>.  Look out, don't step on the Bufo
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marinus</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€  Then</ENAMEX>, without missing a beat, I continued:

            â€œSee <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those leafy</TIMEX> things there?  That's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Impetigo</ENAMEX>.
The feathery thing is Implicit.  And the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vine</ENAMEX> growing
beside it is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thorax</ENAMEX>.  It's sort of like poison ivy so
don't touch.  You'll break out in a rash.  The flowering
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Divertissement</ENAMEX>.  And that bristly thing is
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Septum</ENAMEX>.  One variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Septum</ENAMEX> has been genetically
mutated by exposure to radon in the soil; it's
called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the Deviated Septum</ENAMEX>.â€  Without a blush I
eyed ground-hugging <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and reeled off their
names: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hex, Ponder, Explicit, and Envy</ENAMEX>.

            â€œSee the ground cover with the yellow blossoms?â€
I said.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œIt</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Regalia</ENAMEX>.â€

            I was delighted to answer questions about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterflies</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, and creepy crawly things:

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œYes</ENAMEX>, that's an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Utter Gall</ENAMEX>.  And there in a row
are a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sheer Audacity, a Wretched Excess</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cistern</ENAMEX>.
I had hoped we'd see a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Damnable Outrage</ENAMEX> but
they usually hole up in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daytime</TIMEX>; there might be
one hiding there in that patch of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philanthropy</ENAMEX>.  The
orange one is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flirtatious Glance</ENAMEX> and, look, the little
one hiding behind that bed of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logic</ENAMEX> is the Furtive
Glance.  That one in the ferns is a Connubial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bliss</ENAMEX>.  The fern itself is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lurch</ENAMEX>.â€

            Touring the tourist attraction's aviary--in
which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> flew free while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> strolled in a
glass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX>--I hit my stride.

            â€œThe big blue <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wading bird</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shrift</ENAMEX>.  The
smaller one there is the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Short Shrift</ENAMEX>.  There's a flock
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cognitive Verbs</ENAMEX> and a pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Light-Hearted Banters</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> zipping around in circles is an Orbital
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sander</ENAMEX>, and the drab little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX> making those sad
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chirps</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Plain Brown Wrapper</ENAMEX>.â€

            At the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX>, I was quick to point out the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Utter Gall</ENAMEX>, a burrowing marsupial similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unmitigated</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gall</ENAMEX>, and the horned mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwellers</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apex</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharynx</ENAMEX>.  Back at home, sitting on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> listening to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> sounds, I would
invariably inform our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> that many of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>'s indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are scarce now.

            â€œWhen we first moved here, a covey of Ruffled
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Grouch</ENAMEX> lived right over there in that hedge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Presumption</ENAMEX>,
but no more.  And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Visage</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Expletive</ENAMEX>, and
Articulate used to grow wild. Now...â€ and I
laughed harshly, â€œnow only the garden catalogues
have them.  And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Expletive</ENAMEX> has even been deleted
from those.â€

            I suspect that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> were so overwhelmed
with the tropical heat that they didn't pay
close enough attention.  Or perhaps it was my habit
of feeding them industrial strength <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinis</ENAMEX> before I
began my nature lessons.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, however, listened solemnly
to my spiel, then presented me with a card.  It said:


Membership in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Indoor Bird Watchers</ENAMEX> is
granted to those who have identified the following
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> through the bottom of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martini</ENAMEX> glass,
while seated--The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Extra-Marital Lark</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Regret</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morning Grouse</ENAMEX>, the After-Dinner
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pee Wee</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Double-Breasted Seersucker</ENAMEX>,
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rosy-Breasted Pushover</ENAMEX>.

            

            I had been checked and mated at my own game.
But that didn't stop me.  I remain addicted to my
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice</ENAMEX>, although torn by the knowledge that all
over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> are innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, naive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>,
and perplexed winter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, all telling their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> about the wildlife I showed them
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>.

            Guilt can't stop me, of course.  Like any other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">addict</ENAMEX>, I can't wait for my next fix.  Come on down,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">y'all</ENAMEX>, I want to take you out in the yard and point out
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wretched Excess, the Ingratiating Manner</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hesitant Smile</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sheer Audacity</ENAMEX>.  There's a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Veritable Shambles right</ENAMEX> beside the front steps, and
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> pond you can spot a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Receptacle</ENAMEX>, an Incipient
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quarrel</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fidget</ENAMEX>.  And look up; there goes
a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Smote</ENAMEX>, circling in the air.  I think it's hunting an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apparent Hoax</ENAMEX>.  See, there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> now, crawling under
that bed of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox</ENAMEX>.
         
         


            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Urdang</ENAMEX>'s comments on â€œpolitically
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">correctâ€ language</ENAMEX> reminded me of a television interview
on a network <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> program <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> after
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">â€œDances With Wolvesâ</ENAMEX>€ won several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy</ENAMEX>
awards.  Live from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pine Ridge</ENAMEX> reservation in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX>, the (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interviewer</ENAMEX> was very
careful to refer to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œNative <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>.â€  The interviewees
consistently referred to themselves as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œIndians</ENAMEX>.â€




         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX>-talk



            Searching for some refreshment in an unfamiliar
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX>, I came across a luncheonette with this
sign in the window: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œHOTâ€ COFFEE</ENAMEX>.  I stared at the
sign for a moment.  Something about the quotation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marks</ENAMEX> made the coffee suspect, the way a real estate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> will call a closet a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œroom</ENAMEX>.â€  Since I didn't feel
like drinking a tepid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverage</ENAMEX>, I walked until I got to
a diner that served me an acceptable cup of java.
There on the menu was listed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œFRESHâ€ EGGS</ENAMEX>.  The
purpose was obviously to highlight, to emphasize,
but I would argue that these places are only hurting
their business.  Scare-quotes, as they are sometimes
called, call into question the very words they assert.

            These are examples in which the wording undercuts
itself, yet without any apparent sarcasm.
There are those who argue that it is simply a case of
language calling attention to itself, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Short</ENAMEX>
noted in a letter to VERBATIM fifteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>.
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Mills</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Solotaire</ENAMEX>,
showed outright suspicion of entrees like â€œRoast
beef with `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gravy</ENAMEX>' â€ and a liquid soap boasting
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œ</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Contains No Phosphates</ENAMEX>!' â€  The basic meaning
does not shift, but somehow its implications turn
against it.  The effect is generally unintentional, like
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> talking at cross-purposes--so I decided
to call this phenomenon â€œcross-talk.â€

            Soon after that, I discovered another kind of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-talk, which has the insidious effect of undercutting
not itself but all related instances.  I was in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarket</ENAMEX>, buying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX>.  â€œWe use only the
finest ingredients,â€ read the label on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ice cream
brand.  This seems like a simple statement, what the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">linguistic philosopher J. L. Austin</ENAMEX> termed a constative
utterance: a base level of communication, with
no metaphor or secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">meanings</ENAMEX> attached.  But
consider the implications of the label: most other ice
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> cut costs by using mediocre contents.
The wording thus has an extended or connotative
aspect to it, becoming what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Austin</ENAMEX> called a performative
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utterance</ENAMEX>.  In fact, many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> use this
kind of wording as a polite way of discrediting their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX>.  The impact of this seemingly nonassertive
language is such that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Drug Administration</ENAMEX>
has recently banned the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œNo Cholesterolâ€</ENAMEX> label
on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> that never had cholesterol anyway.  The
unfair inference is that somehow the manufacturer
has reduced the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, or that other brands
still contain a lot of it.  The increasingly common
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">claims â€œAll Naturalâ€</ENAMEX> and â€œFreshâ€ have a similar effect
and are also coming under federal scrutiny.  But
the investigation should really go beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarket</ENAMEX>:
when a jewelry store that does ear-piercing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">advertises</ENAMEX>, â€œWe sterilize all our instruments,â€ is it
not hinting something unsavory about other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishments</ENAMEX>?

            What accounts for the pernicious effects of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-talk?  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX>-talk seems to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> of irony,
giving a result opposite to what is seemingly intended.
The difficulty arises in trying to say what
kind of irony cross-talk resembles.  Irony of statement,
or sarcasm, seems close: exclaiming, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œWhat a</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">surprise!â€</ENAMEX>  over a drearily foregone conclusion, for
example.  But consider when a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> tells his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, â€œWe're going to surprise you with a birthday
party <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>!â€ There is no irony of
statement intended here, yet the sentence neatly
defeats its purpose.  A clue may be offered by dramatic
irony, in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> knows what the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> is unaware of.  Does the cross-talk in the
birthday-surprise announcement derive from the select
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>, who knows that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> is sabotaging
his meaning?  Situational irony need not involve
language at all, just an action that achieves the
opposite effect of the intention.  Maybe this is where
the bulk of cross-talk belongs, though it needs an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> to apprehend it correctly, which makes it
also linked to dramatic irony.

            The truth is that cross-talk may at times resemble
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> ironies, depending on the intent, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>,
and effect.  And since only irony of statement
is deliberate, the effects of cross-talk range from accidental
to purposeful.  Praeteritio , that sly rhetorical
device of mentioning what one is passing over,
belongs to this category of cross-talk: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œThat</ENAMEX> goes
without sayingâ€ covers up the obvious need to say it,
and â€œI will pass over the topic of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX>'s
adulteryâ€ should be recognizable as the ploy it is.
But then there are instances where the degree of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dislocation</ENAMEX> is unclear.  Does the common capper to a
brief business conversation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œLet</ENAMEX>'s do lunch <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sometime</TIMEX>,â€
signify an upcoming <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> or a polite brushoff?

            Let me illustrate the intricacies involved: I recently
received a card from an academic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> acknowledging
an essay I had submitted.  They were
holding it for further consideration.  The last sentence
read: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œWe assume, of course, that you have
not submitted this essay elsewhere.â€  Is this sarcasm?
Almost certainly not.  Yet once again the implications
run counter to the wording and tone.  The
urbane assume and of course finesse the real meaning
of the sentence, i.e., â€œWe are worried that you
may have indeed submitted this essay elsewhere.â€
The message is all the more urgent because its mere
presence hints that would-be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> often do
submit the same essay to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> simultaneously.

            The most perplexing species of cross-talk remains
the unintentional reversal.  In a recent advertisement
for the luxuriously quiet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Town Car</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Nicklaus</ENAMEX> is trying to make a putt, but cannot
because of the noise of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectators</ENAMEX>.  Through the
miracle of television, all of them are crowded inside
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> with the windows shut, resulting in utter silence.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicklaus</ENAMEX> takes a swing: the ball rolls to the lip
of the cup, where it stops.  Suddenly someone inside
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> sneezes, and the ball slips into the hole.  It is
a funny moment, but what does it imply?  That the
new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is not really quiet?  That quiet is not always
such a good idea, anyway?  And do not both ideas
run counter to the advertising pitch?

            We may mean what we say, but do we always say
what we mean?  A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine once tried to sell his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> by parking it in his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> with a sticker that
read â€œFOR SALE: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300.â</NUMEX>€  He couldn't understand why
no one showed any interest, until a passerby told him
any <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that cheap had to be a lemon.  He promptly
changed the price to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$700</NUMEX> and sold it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX>.
This story shows that interpretation is all important,
as in cheap meaning `inexpensive' to some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and
`shoddy' to others.  To return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX>'s distinction
between constative and performative utterances:
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> eventually concluded correctly that there are
no purely constative utterances.  The simplest sentence,
such as â€œI am a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>,â€ can have secondary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meanings</ENAMEX> in certain contexts: for example, â€œI wish I
were a manâ€ or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œThank God I'm not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.â€ In the
broadest sense, then, any language is potentially
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-talk, given a suitable situation, just as any utterance
may become ironic.  Meaning is not as stable as
we might like it to be.

            At times, the simplest wording can cross up the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reader</ENAMEX>.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX>, I was stopped at a traffic light
with a sign underneath that read, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œRIGHT ON RED</ENAMEX>
AFTER STOP.â€ Since I live where right turns at a red
light are permitted, first I did not think much about
it.  The sign just seemed superfluous.  But then it
occurred to me: why was the notice there at all?  I
stared at the sign for a moment, and I realized that
the words in a way implied their opposite; that is, a
right turn at a red light is not allowed in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX>--except
here.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, I spent so much time
pondering the implications of the wording that I
missed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> traffic light changes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> started to
honk behind me.

            Here is a real cautionary tale.  For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, a sign
along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 80</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> Bridge flashed a â€œBEST ROUTEâ€ arrow to
indicate the road with the least traffic.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Savvy motorists</ENAMEX>
soon realized that everyone took the route indicated
and clogged the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roadway</ENAMEX>--so the â€œbest
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">routeâ€</ENAMEX> was probably the worst <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.  This raised a
troubling question: if enough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were alive to
the real significance of the sign, and so left the â€œbest
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">routeâ€</ENAMEX> alone, would not the sign become trustworthy
again?  In that case, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would once again
take the â€œbest route,â€ which would once again call
the sign into question ... and the situation would
rapidly escalate into a paradox.

            Where does this leave us?  To postulate that all
language is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-faced runs counter to everyday reality,
where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> seem perfectly capable of talking
to others without any slippage in meaning.  Yet to
examine even the simplest utterance is to enter a
labyrinth of possibility.  In literary criticism, deconstruction
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>-response models try to deal
with this problem, deconstructionists pointing out
the inherent instability of all language, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>-response
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> insisting that all meaning resides in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>'s interpretation.  There are also moderates
who believe, with some common sense, that these
ideas are true up to a point.  Perhaps a better way to
put the situation is that language is potentially unstable,
and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> is responsible for a large
part of the determinable meaning.

            Or maybe not.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX>-talk, after all, depends on
some idea of â€œthe real meaningâ€ to achieve its contradictory
effect: it is just that sometimes the meaning
gets lost or misconstrued.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Some years ago</TIMEX> in our
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">faculty</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lounge</ENAMEX>, one of my hazier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> got up to
get another cup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>.  â€œWould you like some?â€
he asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> sitting next to us.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œNo</ENAMEX>, thanks,â€ the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> waved aside his offer.
â€œI don't drink <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>.â€

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œReally?â€</ENAMEX> he said.  â€œWhat do you do with it?â€

            At the time, everyone thought he was kidding.
Looking back on it, I am not so sure.

            All the slang words collected here reveal aspects of
prison life, which is never pleasant.  Being behind
bars is sometimes very dangerous, as evidenced by
terms like shank, smork, gringa , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> .

            Becoming and being a prisoner is very expensive
and requires a mandatory lifestyle that no one
would want to experience.  To avoid the opportunity
to collect your own list of prison slang words, obey
the laws of the land.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Gray</ENAMEX>'s remarks on â€œnonsense about the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> languageâ€ [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>] reminded me of another
myth widely held in the English-speaking
world about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>: it tends to have longer words
than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> does.

            That impression, however, is correct only with
respect to orthographic words.  Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> Impulsquantumzahl
may seem long to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>,
but that is only because <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> uses
closed compounds much more than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> does.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> equivalent of this <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> word is spin
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantum</ENAMEX> number .  Were it to be spelled *spinquantumnumber
or were the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> word to be spelled
*impuls quantum zahl , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would have other impressions,
yet both words have exactly the same
number of syllables (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>) and letters (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seventeen</ENAMEX>).

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Johnson</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medical World</ENAMEX>
            A frequent ploy in reviewing scholarly books is
for the reviewer to chide the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> for not having
written the book he would like to have read.  What a
pleasure it is to report that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Wiltshire</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Melbourne</ENAMEX>'s
account of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Johnson</ENAMEX> and the medical
aspects of his life is just the sort of exposition and
analysis that this reviewer once considered writing
and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wiltshire</ENAMEX> has done it better and on a
broader canvas.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wiltshire</ENAMEX> starts with a review of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s own
medical history: juvenile <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">scrofula</ENAMEX>, poor vision in one
eye, the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œtics</ENAMEX> and gesticulations,â€ gout,
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, a stroke with transient aphasia, and finally
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œdropsyâ€</ENAMEX> with death due to arteriosclerotic heart
disease with congestive failure.  Add to this an account
of his recurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">attacks</ENAMEX> of melancholia, and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is clearly revealed.  By his own statement
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX> was â€œa dabbler in physick,â€ and the reader
is given a full account of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s medical readings
and how he assimilated his knowledge for purposes
of self-medication.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bathurst</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrence, Brocklesby, Heberden</ENAMEX>, and others--are
not neglected.

            In further chapters <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Wiltshire</ENAMEX> sets forth considerable
useful information about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> in 18th
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century England</ENAMEX>, its theories, its mode of practice.
Judicious use of primary sources and an aptitude for
a telling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vignette</ENAMEX> combine to make these chapters
useful and intelligible to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> unfamiliar with the
period.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wiltshire</ENAMEX> makes full use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s own
writing, especially the essays in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Rambler</ENAMEX> and
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Idler</ENAMEX> , to analyze <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s frequent, almost habitual
use of medical ideas as metaphors.

            A well-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> deals with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">astronomer</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rasselas</ENAMEX> as an example of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of learning
whose actions are severely limited by a psychiatric
problem.  Unique in the annals of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnsoniana</ENAMEX> is a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Levet</ENAMEX>, an unlicensed
practitioner who was a valued <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s
peculiar household, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wiltshire</ENAMEX>'s close reading of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s elegy on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levet</ENAMEX> is welcome and commendable.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monograph</ENAMEX> concludes with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> on
therapeutic friendship, dealing chiefly with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s
attempts to steer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boswell</ENAMEX> into a more sensible
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> of life and behavior.  These were only transiently
effective because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boswell</ENAMEX> was less than candid
to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mentor</ENAMEX> about his compulsive drinking and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">whoring</ENAMEX>.

            Some minor cavils: Occasional paragraphs are
devoted to the exposition and dismissal of various
pseudo-psychoanalytic theories about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality</ENAMEX>,
a waste of time and space because no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>
scholar relies upon them.  Also, the exposition of
medical ideas about melancholia relies chiefly on the
contribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Battie</ENAMEX>; the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scotsmen</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cullen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Whytt</ENAMEX>, deserve equal
billing for their contributions toward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-18th century</TIMEX>
ideas on melancholia.  But on balance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wiltshire</ENAMEX>'s
book is sound and sensible, a distinguished
contribution not only to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Johnsonia</ENAMEX> but to the wider
field of eighteenth<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> studies.

            From the standpoint of style, clichÃ©s are anathema:
they are boring, repetitious, and reflective of
poor writing.  From the standpoint of communication,
however, they are extremely important: for
one thing, they provide relief from what could otherwise
be a terrifyingly condensed onslaught of information.
Study a well-written scholarly article;
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">notice</ENAMEX> how compact it is.  Succinct style presents no
problem to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, for they can reread a passage as
often as necessary to assimilate it.  Those who attend
academic conferences soon come to dread the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> who reads aloud a paper meant to be read in
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>: it is almost impossible to assimilate its information
because none of the normal communicative
devices used in viva voce communication are
present--repetition being among them.  Then, too,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> who maintains eye contact with members
of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> can readily detect lack of understanding
or confusion (the â€œknitted-brow signalâ€)
and, if a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>, can take an idea and phrase it
in another way to make it more readily understandable.
ClichÃ©s are the background noise of speech; attention
spans being as brief as they are and the ability
to sustain a prolonged period of concentration
differing considerably among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (even if
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> assumes that the subject under discussion is of
some interest to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listener</ENAMEX>), the insertion in speech
of clichÃ©s acts to give the overworked cells a rest,
however momentary, from overdosing on information.

            ClichÃ©s in writing are another matter; depending
on the style striven for, they might conceivably
serve a function; as with everything else, overdoing
them can create a long-winded, boring experience.

            It is not easy to distinguish between clichÃ©s and
what linguists call collocations--that is, collections
of words that, while not unanalyzable idioms per se
(like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">red herring</ENAMEX>, tall order , or take off in the sense of
`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">satirize</ENAMEX>'), nonetheless seem to fall together with
great frequency.  Serve a function is such a collocation
as are (from the preceding paragraph) from the
standpoint of, provide relief, present a [or no ] problem,
as often [or any adjective/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adverb</ENAMEX>] as , noun
phrases like eye contact, lack of understanding, member
of his [or any pronoun, name, or article] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>,
background noise , and attention span .  Those
who have had experience with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> learning
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as a foreign language are aware that a breakthrough
seems to come as soon as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> starts
using clichÃ©s and colloquial or slang expressions appropriately,
even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>'s pronunciation
may still be far from a native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>'s.  It would
seem that good control over clichÃ©s, especially, is
coordinate with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>'s grasp of the idiom (in
the sense of `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirit</ENAMEX>') of the language.

            A dictionary of clichÃ©s is an entirely different
matter.  I venture to say that there is hardly anything
more soporific than being given the meanings of expressions
that every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native speaker</ENAMEX> knows quite intimately,
from do an about face to yours truly (in this
book).  One could not compile such a book without
giving the meanings, but the interesting and useful
material here for the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> is what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christine</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ammer</ENAMEX> has to say about their past and provenance.
Thus, we learn that on the razor's edge occurs
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Homer</ENAMEX> and that mad as a hatter , which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antedates Alice</ENAMEX>'s teaparty, â€œis thought to come from
the fact that the chemicals used in making felt hats
could produce the symptoms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Vitus</ENAMEX>' dance or
other nervous tremors.â€  As one might expect, many
clichÃ©s are simply metaphors, some of which are
transparent to us, others needing explanation.  Thus,
play ball with seems obvious; but mad as a hatter ,
though properly a simile, needs an explanation; play
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">possum</ENAMEX> is meaningful only to those who have been
told what it means or have had direct experience
with the behavior of opossums.  There are quite a lot
of opossums where I live (not, I hasten to say, of the
possum type meriting the affectionate attention of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dame Edna Everage</ENAMEX>), and one sees them most often
after they have been killed on the road by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>.  A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contemporary</ENAMEX> might thus be inclined to imbue them
with attributes that would give play possum a mysterious
import.  One might well wonder why some
clichÃ©s have survived at all, considering their meaninglessness.
The etymological game being what it
is--( requiescat in ) pace <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Ciardi</ENAMEX>--I fully expect
someone to come up with an origin for cute as a
button that identifies it with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adorable</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX>
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Londoner</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Button</ENAMEX>
or, just to make it more complicated, a corruption of
the expression *acute as a bouton in which bouton
means `stud with a sharp point'--in other words,
originally equivalent to sharp as a tack .

            
               Have a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Nice Day</ENAMEX> contains useful information
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about some 3000</NUMEX> such expressions, and we must be
grateful to Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ammer</ENAMEX> for having come to grips
with a very difficult area of language.  My only criticism
is that she often states that a given expression
â€œfirst appearedâ€ in a certain work, giving the citation.
I cannot see how she can know that the expression
was not already a clichÃ© at the time of its appearance
in print.  In the case of have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a good day</TIMEX> ,
which riles many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, I submit that it is a revival,
for its equivalent must have been in the language
many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> in order to have given rise to the
shortened form (about which no one seems to get
upset), Good day .  On which note I bid you all a good
day.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Urdang</ENAMEX>
         
         
            Wordspinner
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sterling Eisiminger</ENAMEX>, whose name may be familiar
to VERBATIM <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contributor</ENAMEX>, has compiled
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> quizzes that will undoubtedly
boggle the minds of some.  It has always seemed to
me that we view the answering of questions of fact
(like what a word means or what is its etymology) as
either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œeasyâ€</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œdifficultâ€ depending on whether
we know the answer or not.  In other words, if one
does not know the date of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flushing</ENAMEX> Remonstrance
no amount of thinking, soul-searching, calculation,
or any other mental activity is going to yield
the correct response to the question, â€œWhat was the
date of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flushing Remonstrance?â€</ENAMEX>; on the other
hand, if you know that the date was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1657</TIMEX>, one cannot
say that the answer was â€œeasyâ€ or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œdifficultâ€</ENAMEX>: it
is like asking a person his name.  Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have
better memories than others, and we can admire
those who, despite the extraordinary pressure of being
under the klieg lights in a TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> before an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>, are able to dredge up obscure information
in response to quizmasters' questions.  But the accession
of factual information from the recesses of
the memory is not the same as answering questions
that require rapid mental calculation or analysis.  A
very large percentage of quiz shows consist of testing
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>' abilities to recognize familiar
things, like identifying the pattern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K --- ---K</ENAMEX>-- as
kick the bucket before too many letters have been
exposed.  There are several TV quiz programs in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX> in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">winners</ENAMEX> are those
who are quickest at recognizing clichÃ©s, like come
hell or high water , something that the rest of us
spend a lot of time avoiding (though we can scarcely
help knowing them).  Yet, there are some who, believe
it or not, do not possess even minimal control
over this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linguistic dross</ENAMEX>: within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few weeks</TIMEX> I
heard <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newscaster</ENAMEX> say â€œwheres and whyforsâ€
and another refer to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œa Herculanean taskâ€</ENAMEX> (presumably
the labor involved in giving birth to a volcano).
[See, elsewhere in this issue, the review of Have a
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nice Day--No Problem</ENAMEX>! ]

            That having been said (to coin a clichÃ©), quizzes
are for some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> an attractive way to learn things
while playing a sort of game, testing either themselves
or others.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wordspinner</ENAMEX> , some of the quizzes
are mere vocabulary tests, though couched in
light-hearted utterances; for example, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Graffiti II</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> is asked to define the underscored words
in sentences like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œClark Kent</ENAMEX> was a transvestiteâ€
and â€œVasectomy means never having to say you're
sorry,â€ though one could think of a lot of regrettable
actions for which vasectomy would be a feeble excuse.
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">quizzes â€œtestâ</ENAMEX>€ the knowledge of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reader</ENAMEX>'s knowledge of gay, black, or carnival slang,
of the origins of certain words ( topaz matches up
with â€œGreek for `conjecture' because they could
only guess where it came fromâ€), some of tautological
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clichÃ©s</ENAMEX> (like beck and --), others of nautical jargon,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">euphemisms</ENAMEX>, numerical allusions, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yankee</ENAMEX> dialect,
and so forth.

            The range of language is, of course, vast, and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> should not treat with contempt those parts of
the book that deal with matters considered â€œcommon
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">knowledgeâ€</ENAMEX>: those parts that seem recondite to
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> are common knowledge to another.  The challenge
is slightly mitigated in many instances by offering
a listing of multiple choices from among
which one selects the answer.  If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> needs a more
difficult challenge, the choices can be covered by
the hand.

            There is no index, hence no way of retrieving
information once encountered (except by trying to
recall the â€œname of the gameâ€).  But that is not critical,
for this is not a reference book.  The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>-odd
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quizzes</ENAMEX> could serve well as a source for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>
who want to test their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>' knowledge of different
aspects of language.  And while much of the material
might seem simple to sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> learned from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wordspinner</ENAMEX> that
a marriage between a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> and the childless
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX> of the groom's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> is called a leviratic
marriage and that cut the green calabash is Gullah
for `exaggerate.' I am devising ways of working
those into the conversation at the next cocktail party
I am invited to, though that might be my last.

            What ideas would you expect to find expressed
in a book by a liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX>?  Can a holistic
approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> ignore important aspects
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>?  Should your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenager</ENAMEX>'s interest in a
movement with a charismatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> alarm you?

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">everyday</TIMEX> speech, the vocabulary of social science
and philosophy can be misleading.  Just as
badly worn coins convey little information to the numismatist,
their once-clear markings having faded
with countless transactions, so some words convey
little information because their meanings have been
obscured by repeated and varied usage.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charisma</ENAMEX> is
a good example.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Writers</ENAMEX> use the word when it does
not apply and do not use it in those rare instances
when it does.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charisma</ENAMEX>'s unfortunate fate is the subject
of this essay.

            Today, it seems that charismatic figures are everywhere.
Movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>--any-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>
who catches the public eye--may enjoy the designer
label.  It is applied not only to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, but
also, for example, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Pryor</ENAMEX>'s humor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gershwin</ENAMEX>'s
music, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lassie</ENAMEX>.  Are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ninja Turtles</ENAMEX> next?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charisma</ENAMEX> now means little more than dazzle , says
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allan Bloom</ENAMEX>, and he is correct.  But, what did the
word once mean?  And what difficulties do its current
usage pose?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> tributaries brought charisma into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
language, one theological, one sociological.  The
word comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, more precisely, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greek</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New Testament</ENAMEX>.  Theologically, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English Dictionary</ENAMEX> tells us, it is a â€œfree gift or
favor specifically vouchsafed by God, a grace, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX>.â€
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>, it appears only in the Letters of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> and occupies a particularly important place in
I Corinthians.  There, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> discusses a number of
spiritual gifts or charismata , including the gifts of
miracles, healing, and speaking in tongues (divinely
inspired but unintelligible speech).  During the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church's</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early years</TIMEX>, these gifts must have captured
the attention and imagination of many, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paul</ENAMEX>
writes to remind <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> that all charismata have
a common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divine source</ENAMEX> and that none is as important
as love.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Writers</ENAMEX> using charisma or charismatic in this or
related theological senses are not likely to err.
Those using the term in its sociological sense, however,
often go astray.  This <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> meaning of the
term entered <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> through, translations of the
works of the eminent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max Weber</ENAMEX>.
Writing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early twentieth century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX>
used the term in his sociology of religion and sociology
of authority:


The term â€œcharismaâ€ will be applied to a certain
quality of an individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality</ENAMEX> by virtue of
which he is considered extraordinary and treated
as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at
least specifically exceptional powers or qualities.
These are such as are not accessible to the ordinary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, but are regarded as of divine origin
or as exemplary, and on the basis of them the individual
concerned is treated as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œleader</ENAMEX>.â€


            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charisma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX> argued, provided the basis for an
intensely personal form of authority, dramatically
different from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> based both on the impersonal
rule of law (the modern type) and on the sanctity
of tradition (the oldest type).  Historically rare,
charismatic figures, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed</ENAMEX>,
founded new faiths or, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Napoleon</ENAMEX>, won the unswerving
allegiance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> through
military victory.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX> make <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> errors when
they use charismatic .  First, they apply the term to
inappropriate figures.  Even though the word's sociological
meaning has changed ( charisma is â€œthe
capacity to inspire devotion and enthusiasm,â€ according
to the latest OED ), someone like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kissinger</ENAMEX>
cannot merit the label.  Calling such public
figures charismatic devalues the word and strips it of
meaning (meaninglessness certainly triumphs when
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> see charisma in humor or music).

            But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of the word make a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, more serious,
error when they apply the term to virtuous figures
only, as occurs often.  An article in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Housekeeping (â€œCharisma: Who Has It</ENAMEX>!
How They Got It!  How <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">You Can Get It Too!â€</ENAMEX>) mentions
more than fifteen charismatic figures, from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eleanor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roosevelt to Lena Horne</ENAMEX>, all admirable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Riggio</ENAMEX> begins a recent
book on charisma by enumerating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> charismatic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>, all praiseworthy.  After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred</NUMEX>
and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> pages, we finally discover some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demons</ENAMEX>.
As a corrective, I suggest that someone begin
a discussion of charisma like this:


Would you like to develop your charisma?  Would
you like to sway others?  Would you like the
power to drive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to collective
suicide like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Jones</ENAMEX>?  Inspire others to murder
like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Manson</ENAMEX>?  Or, why not really go for
it, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">annihilate millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">innocents</ENAMEX>?  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hitler</ENAMEX>
did it; you can too.


            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Manson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Jones</ENAMEX>--they represent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">charisma</ENAMEX>'s other side, one our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX> invariably
ignore.  When was the last time you heard a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repulsive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> described as charismatic?  In rare
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">instances</ENAMEX>, an individual not universally admired, like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Jackson</ENAMEX>, earns the label, but heinous figures
are never â€œcharismatic.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€  Weber</ENAMEX>, it is worth noting,
had stressed the neutrality of the term:


[Our] sociological analysis will treat [demagogues
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">madmen</ENAMEX>] on the same level as it does the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">charisma</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who are the â€œgreatestâ€ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX>,
prophets, and saviors according to conventional
judgments.


            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX> wanted to compare aspects of charismatic authority
with aspects of his other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of authority.
He did not distinguish between villainous charismatic
figures and virtuous ones because such
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distinctions</ENAMEX>, he felt, would muddy sociological comparisons.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weber</ENAMEX> obviously knew the term could apply
to both.  Modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX>, however, will
not attribute charisma to those they do not like.
Consider the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ayatollah Khomeini</ENAMEX>.  No political figure
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two decades</TIMEX> was more charismatic
than he.  His authority derived from intensely personal
qualities; he ruled without the institutional
supports we associate with national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>; he
inspired his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> and revolutionized his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
But to many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khomeini</ENAMEX> was a fanatic .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charismatic</ENAMEX> is thus used as selectively as neurotic .
Neurotics are those whose behavior we find
odd.  If we like them, however, we speak of their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">idiosyncracies</ENAMEX> .

            When we do not apply the term charismatic to
figures like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khomeini</ENAMEX>, we trivialize them and we
trivialize their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX>.  We label <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fundamentalists</ENAMEX>
irrational or unstable because they are inspired
by someone we do not like.  But charisma is
all about irrationality, and we have little reason to
believe that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khomeini</ENAMEX> were less rational
than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> of, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>.  In fact, as
indicated above, the irrationality of the more spectacular
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">charismata</ENAMEX> drew concerned comment from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint Paul</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I Corinthians</ENAMEX>.  The rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">etymology</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">charisma</ENAMEX> teaches us that great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villains</ENAMEX> and great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX>
can have strangely similar effects on their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charisma</ENAMEX> should thus be used evenhandedly
as well as selectively.  Like other words from the lexicon
of social science and philosophy ( holistic, elitist,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liberal</ENAMEX>, dialectic ), it confuses rather than illuminates
if used indiscriminately.  The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>'s hottest passwords
must not triumph over clear communication.

               There is no part of the world where nomenclature
is so rich, poetical, humorous and picturesque
as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States of America</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Louis Stevenson</ENAMEX>, Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Plains</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1892</TIMEX>)

            

            The fascination of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> place names--their
style and flair and what they reveal about the
land and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>--has captivated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 150</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.  The evaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevenson</ENAMEX>, from a collection
of essays on his travels across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, is not
unusual.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevenson</ENAMEX>, a native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scot</ENAMEX>, had traveled
widely through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seas</ENAMEX>, so he speaks with some experience and perspective.
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">notables</ENAMEX> who have praised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
place names include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Irving</ENAMEX> (in an
essay written in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1839</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walt Whitman</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent BenÃ©t</ENAMEX>.  The qualities most frequently commented
on, perhaps, are originality, uniqueness, and
sound.  Consider the following categories of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
place names, selected from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omni</ENAMEX> Gazetteer

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> place names reveal the national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>,
as well as history and heritage.  In addition, significant
contributions have come from many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> languages
and dialects, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.

            It was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX> that serious scholarship on
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> place names, characterized (unlike most
earlier work) by thoroughness, objectivity, and linguistic
training, began to be published on a regular
basis.  Among the scholarly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneers</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George R.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX>, whose considered reflections are collected
in standard works entitled Names on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>,
revised <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958 and 1967</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> Place-Names
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>).  Prof. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen Walker Read</ENAMEX>, whose distinguished
career now spans <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, contributed
solid yet always thoroughly enjoyable papers,
and in addition has given us the handy phrase
â€œplace-name coverâ€ to describe how place names
indeed blanket the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> with richness, color, and
texture.  Other notables in this necessarily brief catalogue
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toponymists</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry Gannett</ENAMEX>,
working around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the century</TIMEX>, who
compiled several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> gazetteers and a still influential
study on the origin of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> place names; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. L.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mencken</ENAMEX>, with several seminal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
Language (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX>); and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelsie Harder</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illustrated</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Place Names</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>) remains the most reliable resource
for place-name origins.  A full record of work
in this field can be found in bibliographies compiled
since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX> under the names <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sealock, Seely</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> (the latest edition being <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bibliography</ENAMEX> of
Place-Name Literature: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> Edition , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supplemented</ENAMEX> periodically in
the pages of Names , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quarterly journal</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Name Society</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toponymy</ENAMEX> is remarkable not only for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX>
of talented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> who have expanded
the scholarship in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent decades</TIMEX>, but also because
it is not a formal academic discipline, at least not in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.  There are no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> of toponymy,
or even of onomastics that I know of, and no
degrees are awarded in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX>.  (Whether this is
also true of other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> I cannot say.  I have read
that toponymy, gazetteers, and place-name surveys
receive more formal attention in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.K.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> toponymy is carried on by people
of all academic disciplines, and from many walks of
life.  With academia's standard rewards of promotion
and tenure not as readily accruing in this work, the
study of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> place names is by and large in
the hands of true <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> of the subject (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">amateurs</ENAMEX> in
the etymological sense, and dilettantes).  What they
say and write I have found to be characteristically
stimulating and rewarding, not plagued by the turgidity
that so often seems to be the norm in scholarly
papers.

            Place names became an official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1890</TIMEX>.  Confusion had reigned
over mining claims, land surveys, assignment of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">post-office</ENAMEX> names, and exploration reports, and this
created havoc and needless expense in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureaucracy</ENAMEX>,
particularly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> mapping agencies
such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Geological Survey</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USGS</ENAMEX>], the
Army <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corps of Engineers</ENAMEX>, and various other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interior</ENAMEX>.  In a move that, from a lexicographic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">standpoint</ENAMEX>, is decidedly un-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>, the
government set up an official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> to rule on and
standardize the use of place names, both domestic
and foreign.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Board</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geographic</ENAMEX>
Names was established by an executive order
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Harrison</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1890</TIMEX>, and has been active ever since, publishing its
decisions and issuing official gazetteers.  This may be
the only example in which an aspect of the linguistic
practice of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> has been regulated by government
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fiat</ENAMEX>.

            On the other hand, it is largely because of this
unusual intrusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> toponymy
has flourished as a field of study.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Board</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geographic</ENAMEX> Names has compiled and
maintains a massive national database, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geographic</ENAMEX>
Names <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Information System</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNIS</ENAMEX>].  This
computer file lists <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one million</NUMEX> place
names of all kinds (plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variant</ENAMEX> forms): <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, lakes and rivers,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mountains</ENAMEX> and valleys, even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, and cemeteries.  The names themselves,
along with precise locational data and identification
by type, have been painstakingly keyboarded
into machine-readable form from the most
detailed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USGS</ENAMEX> topographic maps, the so-called <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7.5-minute</TIMEX>
series.  Drawn to a scale of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24,000</NUMEX>, each
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7.5-minute</TIMEX> map sheet or quadrangle covers an area
of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8.6 miles</NUMEX> north-to-south by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 7 miles</NUMEX> east-to-west
(the east-to-west distance varies depending on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">location</ENAMEX>, since meridians of longitude radiate out
from the poles and are farther apart <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearer the equator</NUMEX>).
At this scale <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50,000</NUMEX> map sheets are
required to completely cover the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> contiguous
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.  Since it was intended to establish a standard,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNIS</ENAMEX> is very regular in format and is compiled
and maintained according to carefully prepared procedures.
This daunting task is overseen by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USGS</ENAMEX>, specifically the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Branch of Domestic Names</ENAMEX>,
now under the direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Payne</ENAMEX>.  Less comprehensive
government files are also maintained by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of the Census</ENAMEX> (listing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 60,000</NUMEX> populated
places), and by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institute of Standards</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technology</ENAMEX>, formerly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Standards</ENAMEX>
(a compilation, complete with numerical
coding, of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 190,000</NUMEX> populated places, locales,
and neighborhoods of all sizes).

            The work is by no means at an end.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts</ENAMEX>,
including Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Payne</ENAMEX>, have estimated that there are
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 3,500,000</NUMEX> current place names in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> Consider this figure in light of the fact that the
largest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">dictionary</ENAMEX>--now out of print--had
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600,000 or so</NUMEX> entries, including many obsolete
forms.  The highest estimates of the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lexicon</ENAMEX> number far less than the number of place
names in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> alone.  Were it possible to record
and identify all of the current place names (the Place
Name Survey of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, under the direction
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Name Society</ENAMEX>, is attempting
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just this</TIMEX>), still remaining would be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX>
of now inactive names, which are of no less
importance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX>, genealogists, and the like.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Full</TIMEX> coverage would also require accurate
pronunciations for each name, with sensitivity to local
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">preferences</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MAD</ENAMEX>-rid, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BER-lin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEER</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre</ENAMEX> ).  It is perhaps understandable
that those who undertake the creation of a complete
record of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toponymy</ENAMEX> have chosen to
deal with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">estimated 3,000,000</NUMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highways</ENAMEX> across the land as a separate project.

            Taken in this context, the recent publication of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omni Gazetteer of the United States of America</ENAMEX> ,
despite its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500,000</NUMEX> entries, may properly be seen
as only a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step, albeit an ambitious <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>
of the book identified and acquired several government
databases of place names, including, of
course, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNIS</ENAMEX> mentioned above.  Owing to the
marvels of computer technology, coupled with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">foresight</ENAMEX> of the government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">programmers</ENAMEX> who set
up the source databases and the expertise of present-day
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">programmers</ENAMEX> who devised means of accurately
consolidating several different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, an
enormous amount of data (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140,520,000</NUMEX> characters
of text) was integrated, sorted, and typeset in about
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX>.  Automated as well as traditional checking
and proofreading occupied the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> for the better
part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>.  The final product is contained in
11 volumes, on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 9,000 9-by-12-inch</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-column
pages.  The set includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> regional
volumes, each listing the place names of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> or
territories in a region individually.  A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-volume
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Index</ENAMEX> lists all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500,000</NUMEX> entries in a single
A-to-Z sequence.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendices</ENAMEX> volume contains
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> national lists of places such as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
reservations, and historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omni</ENAMEX> Gazetteer
is a national gazetteer of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> that
is as comprehensive as possible.  It is published both
as bound books and on CD-ROM.  Prior to its publication,
such place-name information was only available
in disparate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, and often only on magnetic
tape or in the form of computer printouts.

            Having had the opportunity to sift through so
many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> place names in a relatively short
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">span</ENAMEX>, those of us who edited the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omni</ENAMEX> Gazetteer
were particularly struck by the great diversity in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> naming practices, and what it suggests
about the various eras and cultures that were a part
of the settlement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX>,
for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> are the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of government
below the state level.  Most of the land area
in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> is within town boundaries,
and is primarily administered by the town <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Englanders</ENAMEX>, even if they do not live
in an urban area, can almost always tell you the
name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that they live in.  As the name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX> might suggest, many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> names
were transplanted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Isles</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Bristol,</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Durham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Essex</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hartford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Litchfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manchester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marlboro</ENAMEX>(ugh), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milford</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salisbury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winchester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windsor</ENAMEX>, and
Woodstock are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> names that occur in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or
more <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.  Apart from these, names
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> origin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kennebunkport, Naugatuck, Scituate</ENAMEX>),
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">honorifics</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amherst</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franklin</ENAMEX>), and biblical
names (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canaan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rehoboth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hebron</ENAMEX>) account for
much of the rest.  As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> looks elsewhere in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>, the preponderance of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> borrowings diminishes,
and the purely <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> inventions increase
in proportion, as do <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-based names.  The well-documented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
influence is widespread.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> names are particularly
common in the areas of long-lasting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> colonial
influence, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> names, of course, are common in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper Midwest</ENAMEX> (where <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> explorers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX>,
and French-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trappers</ENAMEX>, left their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mark</ENAMEX>), in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> bordering <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quebec</ENAMEX>, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX>.

            The differing forms of administrative divisions
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> is also revealed in naming practices.  For
example, county <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, significant in most of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>, is relatively unimportant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX>.
In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode Island</ENAMEX> have abolished
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">county</ENAMEX> government altogether, and in those
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> the former county boundaries merely furnish
a convenient way in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can refer to a regional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>.  But as one travels west and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">south</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">counties</ENAMEX> are politically vital, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">towns</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> sense, at least, almost
nonexistent.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œtownsâ€</ENAMEX> are found
to some extent in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX>.)  In many rural areas west of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX> can be as big as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> are few and far between,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do not associate closely with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>,
village, or any other such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> below the county
level.  Mail, of course, comes to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX> that
handles rural route delivery, but those who receive
such mail may not live in the place with the post
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, and hence do not immediately associate with
it.  When asked where they live, such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> are more
likely to say their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX>, then give a reference
point and directions: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œOur place is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ten miles</NUMEX> north
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baxter</ENAMEX>, off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 102</ENAMEX>, then left <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two miles</NUMEX> on
Route <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47.â</NUMEX>€  So despite <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 200,000</NUMEX> populated
place names recorded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omni Gazetteer</ENAMEX> , there
are still many areas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> where the place-name
cover is thin.  Local informants, we hope, will
allow us to correct and expand on the entries compiled
so far.

            Most of the examples above have been populated
places, as these names tend to be more familiar
to a broader <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>.  So we have not examined the
bulk of the place-name cover, which is in the form of
names for natural features.  But perhaps VERBATIM
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> can more readily allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> the convenience
of such specialization when they consider
the issue from the viewpoint of a toponymist.  As
those who work in the field all too soon come to
realize, most of the names have yet to be recorded,
much less described; the greater burden lies ahead.
With time and additional resources we might begin
to see the fight at the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX>, perhaps in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> to fifteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.  All the while, of course, just as
with all aspects of language, new names are coming
into being, others passing out of use, each reflecting
a bit of history or culture.  Taken together, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
place names are a unique primary source, a record
of our cultural memory.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> of that part
of the record we do have, however imperfect, will
still, we hope, give new impetus to this enlightening,
often fascinating study by providing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> on
which to build.

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Editor</ENAMEX>
         
         


            Having heard the term gedunk for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time
and queried its meaning and derivation in a recent
conversation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midwesterners</ENAMEX>, I decided to track
it myself.  Those who used the term mentioned it so
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cavalierly</ENAMEX>--to mean a `sweet or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX>,' even the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shop</ENAMEX> that sold it--that I supposed I'd have no difficulty
looking it up.

            Referring to dictionaries old and new, I found
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gedunk</ENAMEX> listed only in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster 3</ENAMEX> , with that frustrating
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">label â€œorigin</ENAMEX> unknown.â€  I examined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">English Dictionary</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford Universal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</TIMEX>) and found no listing in either.
Neither was the term cited in any of the many references
I examined, until I saw <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Anderson</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œThe Book of Slang</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Jonathan David Publishers</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle Village</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>.  There the definition
was a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œsweet treat</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX>,â€ no derivation.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>
gives â€œsomething sold at a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda fountain</ENAMEX> or
snack <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>.â€  After querying others, I learned only
that the word was used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U. S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> during the
1950s.

            I'm stuck on the derivation, finding no hints at
all.  Because the word sounds to me <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>
or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, I tried dank `thanks' or gedank
`thought, idea' but could not bridge the gulf between
definitions.

            I guess the use is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>, not used perhaps
until the fifties.  Do VERBATIM <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> know?





         
         


            As a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscriber</ENAMEX> to VERBATIM I was sorry to
miss the learned disquisitions on the grammatical
use of the f -word.  The apotheosis was reached,
without doubt, in the western desert when a disconsolate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">squaddie</ENAMEX> who was peering through the mechanical
entrails of his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> was asked by his oppo
what was â€œup.<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€ â€œI dunno</ENAMEX>,â€ he replied, â€œI think the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">f...g f.</ENAMEX>..r's finally <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">f...gwell f...d.â</ENAMEX>€

            In the matter of the adoption of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in preference
to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> as the official <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> language
[XVII<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX>], according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Berlitz</ENAMEX>'s book, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tongues</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> as
well as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> were suggested, with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> favored
for several reasons:

            There were many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">German-speaking Americans</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and elsewhere could learn to use German
easily; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> would be easy for other colonials to
learn, since it was basically similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>; the
Hessians, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> troop <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">levies â€œrentedâ€</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>,
were deserting to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> and many
wished to remain in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.





         
         


            There is support, in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2nd Supplement</ENAMEX>
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of American Slang</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wentworth</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flexner</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tony Thorne</ENAMEX>'s definition, in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bloomsbury Dictionary of Contemporary</ENAMEX> Slang
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>], of `callow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>' for gunsel .  That appears
to be the primary meaning of the word, whose suggested
definition is from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX> genzel, gantzel and/
or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> GÃ¤nslein, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GÃ</ENAMEX>¤nzel `gosling, young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goose</ENAMEX>.'
In the underworld, apparently, it came to be applied,
contemptuously, to a whole range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,
mostly young: apprentice hobo, inexpert hoodlum,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">punk</ENAMEX>, nance, sneak, informer, and so on.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Maltese</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falcon</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart</ENAMEX> character was probably using
it as a general term of disparagement.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellery Queen</ENAMEX>, in In the Queen's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parlour</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1957</TIMEX>),
has a note on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dashiell Hammett</ENAMEX>'s use of the word.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammett</ENAMEX> had a taste for trying to slip censorable
words past cautious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>, and he succeeded with
gunsel , which sounds innocent enough to anyone
who never heard it before.  When the book was
coming out in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Black Mask</ENAMEX> , in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> presumably
took gunsel to be a synonym of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gunman</ENAMEX> , and
in that sense it was very widely adopted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammett</ENAMEX>'s
imitators, by the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, and even, it
seems, by the underworld.





         
         


            Regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. B. Lawrence</ENAMEX>'s comments on my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BIBLIOGRAPHIA</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>], I am obliged to set the
record straight.  I asked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>,
and fellow linguists about the grammaticality
of eclectic bounty .  Not one felt that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York</ENAMEX>
Times erred in its usage.  Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> is a prescriptivist
and we linguists are descriptivist in orientation.

            Turning to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX>'s remark that featherweight
should precede lightweight , my listing them
in the reverse order was done randomly and in no
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> implied how much a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boxer</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wrestler</ENAMEX> weighed.
He, unfortunately, jumped to the wrong conclusion.
My list was also merely indicative of the terms currently
employed (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of them), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernstein</ENAMEX>'s Reverse
Dictionary mentions the other major divisions
as well.  I could have listed the other terms too, but
chose not to do so.

            Finally, concerning the etymology of savvy , Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrence</ENAMEX> should not believe everything he reads in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mencken</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Language</ENAMEX> .  In
fact, I checked in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">dictionaries</ENAMEX>,
and they all state that savvy comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sabe</ENAMEX> .  These dictionaries are simply wrong on this
point (as they are, I might add, on many other etymologies).
No less an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jr.</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornell University</ENAMEX>, one of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">world</ENAMEX>'s leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Romance</ENAMEX> linguistics and
historical linguistics, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of scholarly
books and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of scholarly articles, states
that it derives ultimately from Cantonese Pidgin
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese through Chinese Pidgin English</ENAMEX> ( Pidgin
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole Languages</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornell University Press</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1966, p. 6</ENAMEX>).





         
         


            I want to add my bit to the letters of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zellig Bach</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol Steinmetz</ENAMEX> in respect to the mangled forms in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yiddish</ENAMEX> issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Census</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>.
Though I'm not a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> I feel personally offended
that they treated the language in such a cavalier
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>.  The form (which I obtained) was downright
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gibberish</ENAMEX>, corresponding to no idiom on earth.
In spelling, grammar, and plain meaning it made no
sense whatsoever.  Surely they could have consulted
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YIVO</ENAMEX>, whose name must have penetrated even
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">darkest Washington</ENAMEX>.

            I read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bryson</ENAMEX>'s article <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œEnglish Know-How</ENAMEX>,
No <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Problemâ</ENAMEX>€ with much interest and amusement.
However, some of the words he indicates as listed by
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economist</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> are not by origin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> but
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, cigarette ) or international ( telephone ).
True, they may owe their worldwide currency and
ubiquity to the fact that they were part of the body
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word export, but are they really words
that originated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> or are they loanwords in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>?

            In your OBITER DICTA you translate hocking a
tchainik as `gossiping.'  Isn't it something stronger:
`senseless chatter, needless noise, committing oral
nuisance'?  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uriel Weinreich</ENAMEX>'s dictionary gives â€œtalking
nonsense.â€

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Misha Allen</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and I are, respectively,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Anti</ENAMEX>-Aleichem
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX>.  It is an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> that
stands on guard against the practice by cataloguers,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">librarians</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> of truncating
the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sholem Aleichem</ENAMEX> and producing a (Mr.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œAleichem.</ENAMEX>â€  This nom de plume, as is known,
means `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peace Be Upon You</ENAMEX>' and it strikes us as absurd
to see him referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œBe Upon Youâ</ENAMEX>€ or Mr.
â€œUpon You.â€ Even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York Times</ENAMEX> is a frequent
offender.  I recently read <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Life After Death</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Harpur</ENAMEX>.  He makes reference to
the eighteenth<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mystic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Israel Baal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shem Tov</ENAMEX> and a paragraph later refers to him as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œTovâ€</ENAMEX>--a similar misunderstanding.  Sholem
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aleichem</ENAMEX> is a single expression and he who bisects it
commits nothing less than literary homicide.  I mention
it now as we have just marked the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">75th</NUMEX> anniversary
of his death and his name has been appearing
here and there.





         
         


            To <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David L. Gold</ENAMEX>'s comments [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVIII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>] on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leslie</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunkling</ENAMEX>'s review of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Dictionary of Surnames</ENAMEX>
[<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">XVII, 4, 11</ENAMEX>] I would like to add <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> remark: not
only is the list of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s personal acknowledgments
far longer than their bibliography of printed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> consulted (as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gold</ENAMEX> notes), but even if a certain
work appears in the bibliography, that does not
necessarily mean they relied on it.

            Here is an example from my own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish</ENAMEX>
family names: the bibliography lists <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benzion C.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaganoff</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Dictionary of Jewish Names and Their</ENAMEX>
History , but the few times this work is cited in A
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Surnames</ENAMEX> , a disclaimer follows immediately
to the effect that no support could be found for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaganoff</ENAMEX>'s explanation (at the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon for instance</ENAMEX>).

            It is not surprising that no credence was attached
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaganoff</ENAMEX>.  A review of his book in Onoma

            It is not my normal practice to respond to unfavorable
reviews of my books, since obviously a reviewer
is entitled to his or her own views, attitudes
and prejudices when assessing a work.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> takes
the rough with the smooth, like most things in life.
But when a reviewer misrepresents what one has
written, I feel a counter is called for.

            The review of my <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bloomsbury Dictionary of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dedications</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">XVII,4</NUMEX>] made no mention of the fact
that the quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dedications</ENAMEX> are glossed or explicated.
To ignore this fact is to treat the book as if it
were a dictionary of headwords with no accompanying
definitions or etymologies.  The reviewer quotes
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> dedications (misquoting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>) and merely says
they seem to him â€œneither funny nor clever.â€  They
are actually not meant to be either.  But the whole
point of the apparently trivial dedication by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mary</ENAMEX>
Storr [â€œI dedicate this book to my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">friendsâ€</ENAMEX>] is that
the names of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> follow, making
the dedication something of a record.  And when
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger McGough</ENAMEX> dedicates his poems for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
â€œto those who gaze out of windows when they
should be paying attentionâ€ he is punning on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title</ENAMEX> of the book, which is In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glassroom</ENAMEX> (not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Classroom</ENAMEX> , as misquoted: ironically, in view of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reviewer</ENAMEX>'s own article in the same issue on â€œAccuracy
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quotationsâ€</ENAMEX>!).

            It also seems odd to me that the reviewer should
not be curious about the meaning of the strange
name in the dedication â€œTo my dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hommy-Beg</ENAMEX>.â€
It is when one discovers that the dedicatee
was a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manxman</ENAMEX>, and that the words are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manx</ENAMEX> for
`<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Little Tommy</ENAMEX>' that one feels the nice sense of satisfaction
that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detective</ENAMEX> must feel when he has at last
unraveled a long baffling clue.  But this gloss on the
dedication is omitted in the review, leaving the
reader no wiser than before.

            Incidentally, the reviewer of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Dictionary of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Names</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Hanks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flavia Hodges</ENAMEX>, is
wrong to state that â€œthey choose to ignore <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX> .â€
They don't: it is included as a variant of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh</ENAMEX> .





         
         


            Permit me a few observations on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Webb</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">addendum</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>] to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Cohen</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œJingo Lingoâ</ENAMEX>€
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>].

            The former's statement that â€œ[t]he French
words for junkie are toxoman and morphinman , neither
of which merits official useâ€ leaves me puzzled.
I've never seen (or even heard) the words toxoman
or morphinman , though I wouldn't swear that no
Frenchman anywhere has ever used them.  There
are, indeed, many words invented from pseudo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suffix - man</ENAMEX> (e.g., barman `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bartender</ENAMEX>';
recordman `record-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX>'; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of others),
but I don't believe that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webb</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> examples
are among them.  On the other hand, the common
terms morphinomane and toxicomane (note spellings)
not only â€œmerit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> useâ€ but have been in
the language for quite some time (ca <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900 and 1920</TIMEX>
respectively), as have numerous other nouns--e.g.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mÃ©galomane</ENAMEX>, cocaÃ¯nomane, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hÃ©roÃ¯nomane, Ã©thÃ©romane,</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>--ending in the similarly pronounced
but very different <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>-rooted suffix - mane .  ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belle</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epoque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> will recall <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the celebrated night</TIMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">club-performer</ENAMEX>-cum-anatomical-wonder Le
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PÃ©tomane</ENAMEX>, much admired for his ability-- mirabile
rectu! --to fart [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pÃ©ter</ENAMEX> ] in near-perfect tune, unto every
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sharp</ENAMEX> and flat(ulence), and with great brio, and
whose rendition of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Marseillaise</ENAMEX> is said to have
been particularly memorable.)  For that matter, the
word junkie itself was even adopted into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œinâ€</ENAMEX> slang of the eighties-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">le franÃ§ais branchÃ©</ENAMEX> --
along with the less common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addict</ENAMEX> , more often reserved
for figurative use.  An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addict</ENAMEX> du foot , for example,
is a soccer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">junkie</ENAMEX>.

            While on matters Gallic I would point out, in
regard to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Sharp</ENAMEX>'s article in the same issue
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>], that, though not as addicted to the practice
as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> is also given to creating
words from letter abbreviations.  Note, for example,
such slang forms as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bÃ©dÃ©</ENAMEX> (from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BD</ENAMEX>, bande
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dessinÃ©e</ENAMEX> `[sophisticated] comic strip'); elpÃ© (from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LP</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, `long-playing record'); and jitÃ© (from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JT</ENAMEX>, journal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tÃ©lÃ©visÃ©</ENAMEX> `television news broadcast').  Along the same
lines, though somewhat more involved, is the word
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pÃ©cu</ENAMEX> `toilet paper' (from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PQ</ENAMEX> , itself a punnish abbreviation
of papier cul ), which has also come to mean a
pompous piece of writing, with the corresponding
verb pÃ©cufier .





         
         


            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Orbaum</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPISTOLAE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>] wants to
make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> aware of what he calls a â€œmistranslationâ€
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>.  He directs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>' attention to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isaiah</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:14: â€œBehold</TIMEX> a virgin
shall conceive and bear a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>....<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€  He</ENAMEX> also
cites the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Testament</ENAMEX> passage in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:22-23</TIMEX> which speaks of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> as the fulfillment of
this passage from Isaiah: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œBehold a virgin shall be
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>....â€  He then cites modern translations
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isaiah</ENAMEX> which read â€œyoung <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">womanâ€</ENAMEX> instead of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œvirgin.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ He</ENAMEX> calls these â€œcorrections of the original
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mistranslation</ENAMEX>.â€

            Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orbaum</ENAMEX> is correct regarding the translation
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> word in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Isaiah 7</ENAMEX>--the word ` almah
means `young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>,' and also correct that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>
word betulah means `virgin.'  However, in several
respects he has either misinterpreted the data
or has not taken into account the relationship between
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New Testaments</ENAMEX> in regard to ancient
translations.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.  The word ` almah which appears in Isaiah
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:14</TIMEX> can be translated `young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>' or `maiden' or
`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> of marriageable age.'  It is a general term
and can refer to any young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.  While it is not a
specific indicator of virginity, it is not used to mean.
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> is no longer a virgin.  In fact,
Rebekah, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> sought as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abraham</ENAMEX>, is referred to as ` almah in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Genesis 24:43</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rebekah</ENAMEX>'s virginity was never in question and she
was referred to as ` almah , not betulah .  Therefore,
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orbaum</ENAMEX> is incorrect when he says that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>
betulah â€œwould have been used in the original
had the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> been a virgin.â€  The word
` almah allows the possibility that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> was a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">virgin</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.  That there is a relationship between Isaiah 7
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Matthew 1</ENAMEX> is correct.  The gospel cites the passage
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isaiah</ENAMEX> â€œa virgin shall be with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>...â€
and considers it to be fulfilled in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>.  But, is the
passage in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew a â€œmistranslation?â</ENAMEX>€ Why does
this gospel use the term virgin?  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew</ENAMEX>'s gospel
was certainly not influenced by an â€œoriginal mistranslationâ€
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Bible</ENAMEX>!

            There is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> question here: Did the
gospel of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew</ENAMEX> misquote the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>?  Which <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>
was this gospel using as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>?

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Testament</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> used a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
translation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>, not the original <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>.
When the gospel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaiah</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:14</TIMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, they read parthenos , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> translation of
` almah .  This term had a narrower range of meaning
than ` almah , and more specifically meant â€œvirgin,â€
but it was within the range of equivalence for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> term ` almah .  The gospel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> did not misquote
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> in this matter.  The gospel writer
read the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> translation and related this passage,
as well as many others, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translators</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hebrew Bible</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some 300 years</TIMEX> or more before the composition of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New Testament</ENAMEX> were not misquoting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>;
they were doing the difficult work of translation
from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> language into another.  As all of us
who love words know, translators are not mechanics
who simply replace a word in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> language by another
word identical in meaning.  Translators are interpreters.
They look for the word or phrase which
will best bring to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> of their time the text
being translated.

            Translators of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Bible</ENAMEX> had the
same task as did the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> translators <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> before:
to make this ancient text accessible to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">their day</TIMEX>.  What texts did the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translators</ENAMEX> use?  They had <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> texts
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>, and they used these in their work.  The
translators of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Bible</ENAMEX> were translating
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>; for them, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>
consisted of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Testament and the New Testament</ENAMEX>.
When they read the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
texts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isaiah</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> text of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Matthew 1</ENAMEX>,
they had to decide which terms from the common
language would best express what was in the ancient
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manuscripts</ENAMEX>.  The adoption of the term virgin was
not a mistranslation: it was a judgment of the translators
based on the texts which they had before them
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> for which the translation was intended.

            Bible translators <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as a general rule prefer
to translate from the original languages--for the Old
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Testament</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">or Hebrew Bible</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aramaic</ENAMEX>,
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Testament</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>.  However, when the
reading is unclear or ambiguous, difficult or corrupt,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX> will turn to other translations or versions
to see how ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translators</ENAMEX> rendered passages
in question.  Bible translators <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> must also
take into account their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> as they translate.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New English Bible</ENAMEX> is addressed to an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New American Bible</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">New Revised Standard Version</ENAMEX> has as
part of its translation agenda the elimination of language
which has been made sexist by the limitations
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.

            We must be cautious in our assessments of translations
to be aware of the subtleties of translation
before we too quickly attach the label â€œmistranslation.â€
That <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> have different interpretations
of a number of passages in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> is
apparent.  The availability of many excellent translations
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> affords <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> a chance to see how a
variety of first-rate translators read and interpret ancient
texts.  Different interpretations by excellent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> are far different from mistranslations.  The
modern translations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isaiah</ENAMEX> which are cited above
are legitimate translations; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> translation
is also a legitimate translation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isaiah</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7</ENAMEX>, not a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œmistranslation.</ENAMEX>â€





         
         


            It appears that I am becoming the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œmistranslations.</ENAMEX>â€  Some time ago I came to the defense
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome</ENAMEX> and his â€œmistranslationâ€ which
gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX> horns.  Now I feel compelled to respond
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Orbaum</ENAMEX>'s interesting letter [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPISTOLAE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVII</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>] about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œmistranslationâ€</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> word
` almah in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isaiah</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:14</TIMEX>, which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orbaum</ENAMEX> says ought
not be translated `virgin' but `young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.'

            As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of VERBATIM well know, it is simplistic
to assume that there is but one correct translation
of any given word.  `<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Almah</ENAMEX> is no exception.  It almost
surely does mean `young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>,' but it can also
mean a `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>,' `maiden,' `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX>,' `youthful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX>,' a
`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> of marriageable age' or `the age of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">puberty</ENAMEX>'
(according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gesenius-Robinson</ENAMEX>, my trusty <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1888</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Lexicon</ENAMEX>).  It is not difficult to
infer virginity from some of these usages (at least in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Biblical</NUMEX> times when virginity prior to marriage was
expected of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>).  My old lexicon also points
out, as does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Orbaum</ENAMEX>, that the customary word
for `virgin' is bethulah, not `almah .

            That brings us to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Septuagint</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
translation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew Old Testament â€œsaid</ENAMEX> to
have been made by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian Jews</ENAMEX> during the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptolemy Philadelphus</ENAMEX>...
this version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> was used in
Mediterranean lands during the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> and
the early <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX>  (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Rose BenÃ©t</ENAMEX>, The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reader</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Encyclopedia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2nd ed., 1968</ENAMEX>) The Septuagint
translates `almah in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isaiah</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:14</TIMEX> as parthenos.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thayer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">English Lexicon of the New Testament</ENAMEX>
says of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">parthenos: â</ENAMEX>€œa virgin... (fr. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hom</ENAMEX>. down;
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept.</TIMEX> chiefly for bethulah, several times for na`arah;
twice for `almah ...).â€  So we see that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">word â€œchieflyâ€</ENAMEX> chosen by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Septuagint</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> to
mean parthenos is the word bethulah , which Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orbaum</ENAMEX> stresses is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œthe Hebrew</ENAMEX> word for virgin .â€
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Septuagint</ENAMEX> also chose
the word parthenos to translate `almah in Isaiah
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:14</TIMEX>, where one might have expected a less specific
word.  It becomes very muddy.  Gesenius-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX>,
by the way, translates bethulah as â€œa virgin pure and
unspotted,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€ â€œa</ENAMEX> virgin just married,â€ and â€œa young
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spouseâ€</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8</ENAMEX>, where bethulah is translated
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Septuagint</ENAMEX> as nymphe, â€œa betrothed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bride,â€ â€œa</ENAMEX> recently married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wifeâ€</ENAMEX>--
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thayer</ENAMEX>).  The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jerusalem Bible</ENAMEX>, in a footnote to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">word â€œmaidenâ€</ENAMEX> (as `almah is translated by them in
Isaiah <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:14</TIMEX>) says:


The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> version reads â€œthe virgin,â€ being
more explicit than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hebr</ENAMEX>. which uses almah,
meaning either a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> or a young, recently
married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.

            

            A more recent commentary on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isaiah</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:14</TIMEX> may
be helpful here, or may simply muddy the waters
further.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Stuhlmueller</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.P., in â€œPsalm</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prophecy of Isaiah Evolving</ENAMEX> into a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prophetic</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Messianic Roleâ</ENAMEX>€ in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Psalms</ENAMEX> and Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Studies</ENAMEX> on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Testament</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, writes:


... we return to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isa</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:14</TIMEX> and especially the Septuagint
rendition of `<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alma</ENAMEX>.  As is well known, this
Greek text renders the word with the technical
word for virgin, parthenos, not with what one
would expect, neanis--young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maid</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
word which is deliberately put in place here in
the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquila</ENAMEX>, Symmachus
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theodotion</ENAMEX>.  We suggest that the Septuagint
sees the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maid</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">virgin spouse</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX>.  The text of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isaiah</ENAMEX>, therefore, resounds
with extraordinary richness: the mysterious, marvelous,
fertile ways of new life, accomplished
solely by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s faith.

            

            Innumerable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> and verses might be cited
without a definitive answer and without convincing
any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of the debate that `almah unquestionably
means, or does not mean, `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">virgin' in Isaiah 7:14</ENAMEX>.
It may be worth noting here that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Luther</ENAMEX> used
the word <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jungfrau</ENAMEX> to translate `almah , bethulah , and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parthenos</ENAMEX> .  Jungfrau , although referring almost exclusively
to `virgin' in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">German</ENAMEX>, has the
literal root sense of `young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>,' or `young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>.'
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word virgin itself comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
virgo , which can mean `virgin,' `maiden,' or `young
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>' and which reflects the same ambiguity as
the other languages.

            Translation cannot be an exact science, and so
we may never know precisely what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of
Isaiah <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:14</TIMEX>, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:23f</TIMEX>, meant.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isaiah</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> (and there were most likely more
than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>) were poets.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>(s) had an ax
to grind and sought to prove a point by using a
rabbinical-style proof-text argument.  In either case,
we must not expect these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> to use words as we
should like them to have done.  Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translators</ENAMEX> are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">poets</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, too, and we must not expect them
necessarily to respond to words in our fashion, either.
I would make a plea that we all be a bit more
careful in our use of the term â€œmistranslation.â€

            It remains unclear to me on whom Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orbaum</ENAMEX>
would pin the blame for what he calls â€œthe original
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mistranslation</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€  He</ENAMEX> seems to suggest that somehow
we should fault the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translators</ENAMEX> who produced
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Version</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>, but, as
we have seen, the confusion lies not so much with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteenth century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> as with
the very nature of the art of translation.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>, nevertheless, chose to latch on to the
concept of the Virgin Birth long before the sixteenth
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> ( cf . Tertullian, who lived c. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">160-240 A.D.</ENAMEX>) in
any case, and we do not know whether the use of
Isaiah <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:14</TIMEX> was to justify an already extant belief
with a text, or whether it was to take an already
accepted text and graft its meaning, as was then understood,
upon the events of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annunciation</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>.

            Ultimately, it seems, one's reading here comes
most likely from religious orientation rather than
from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œcorrectnessâ€ of translation.  We agree to disagree
and, meanwhile, enjoy the richness of languages
and the art of playing among them.





         
         
            Writing <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Maketh an Exact Man</ENAMEX>



            The title is taken from one of Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Bacon</ENAMEX>'s
sententious essays one read as a schoolboy.  As
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, I wish it were true.  But precision and accuracy
are elusive virtues, and any number of pitfalls
lie in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trail</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herewith</ENAMEX> is an account and plausible
explanation of a few howlers committed by competent,
experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> in books and articles I
have read in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent months</TIMEX>.

            In her fine biography, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nora</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Real Life of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mollie Bloom</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houghton Mifflin</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>),
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brenda Maddox</ENAMEX> feels impelled to flesh out the account
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nora</ENAMEX>'s life, which revolved largely around
her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, by describing the decoration of their
flat in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Square Robiac</ENAMEX>.  The walls were hung with
â€œfamily portraits (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in big bonnets and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in
red hunting coats) and his reproduction of a
Vermeer view of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghent</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€  Alas</ENAMEX>, no: it was a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delft</ENAMEX>.  Vermeer was born, lived, painted, and died in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delft</ENAMEX>.  He never, so far as we know, visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ghent</ENAMEX>,
beautiful as it is.  How did the geographical mistake
occur?  Maddox, far too young to have visited the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joyces</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, was relying on an account by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthur</ENAMEX>
Powers in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Joyce We Knew</ENAMEX> , who had visited the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joyces</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> and who had mistaken the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
The point was not checked by the copy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, probably
an inexperienced <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">B.A. in English Lit.</ENAMEX>, underpaid
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>, and the lapsus appears in the
text.

            Faulty geography is the basis for an error in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peter</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Winch</ENAMEX>'s review of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Blumenburg</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HolenausgÃ</ENAMEX>¤nge
that appeared in the usually faultless Times
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Literary Supplement</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 13-19, 1989</TIMEX>].  He
starts with a bit of name-dropping, one of the minor
sins of academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>, to show his familiarity
with the great names of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> philosophy,
and continues with<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">, â€œJohann Bachofen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedrich Nietzsche</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Burckhardt</ENAMEX>
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZÃ¼rich University</ENAMEX>...â€  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winch</ENAMEX>, who
teaches philosophy at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Illinois</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urbana</ENAMEX>,
has mistaken <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZÃ</ENAMEX>¼rich for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Basel</ENAMEX>, where they
were both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX>, ca . 1870s.
Such inaccuracies in the opening sentence of a book
review fail to inspire confidence.

            At a different level of inaccuracy are some
lapses in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Craft</ENAMEX>'s new book, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Small Craft Advisories</ENAMEX> ,
a collection of clever essays on musical topics.
Craft set himself up as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stravinsky</ENAMEX>'s amanuensis, and
his apercus are well worth reading; but when he mislabels
the tile of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Larkin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Required Writing</ENAMEX> as
Required <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Reading</ENAMEX> , he kills <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larkin</ENAMEX>'s playful title.  He
also refers to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mozart</ENAMEX>'s first love, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aloyisia Weber</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constanze</ENAMEX>'s older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aloysius</ENAMEX>, creating a sexual
ambiguity that even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Sellars</ENAMEX> did not dare
hint at in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amadeus</ENAMEX> .  Aloysius was the name of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sebastian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flyte</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">teddy bear in Brideshead Revisited</ENAMEX> , but
not the given name of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mozart</ENAMEX>'s first love.  The error
suggests sloppy proofreading.

            More egregious are errors committed because
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> is ignorant of the facts.  In a
recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC Symposium</ENAMEX> on the ethics of genetic engineering
[<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 22, 1989</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Steiner</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> pundit and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of the mandarin style,
took the negative view, largely because the margin
for error was too great.  In addressing the question
of antenatal treatment of congenital diseases, he
claimed that had we been able to treat congenital
syphilis, we would have lost the genius of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beethoven</ENAMEX>.
This is simply untrue.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beethoven</ENAMEX> did not have
congenital syphilis, a disabling disease that usually
produces driveling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idiots</ENAMEX>.  Whether he acquired
syphilis as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> has been suggested and debated,
but the evidence seems to be against it.  But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steiner</ENAMEX>'s rhetoric and video-camera style were
so persuasive that it was easy to overlook the fact
that his argument (or part of it) was based on a complete
misstatement of the facts.

            The same charge of ignorance can be leveled at
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick R. Karl</ENAMEX>, whose biography <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Faulkner</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Writer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weidenfeld & Nicolson</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>) has many fine literary insights.  But we
read medical information such as â€œAt <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:30 A.M.</TIMEX> on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 6</TIMEX>, just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-and-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after admission
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanitarium</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Faulkner</ENAMEX> died...
The diagnosis was definitely coronary thrombosis, in
which a piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> that has formed on the vein wall
breaks away and blocks the passage of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> in the
vein; the result, loss of blood flow, heart stoppage,
almost immediate death.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€  Karl</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Literature</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.U.</ENAMEX>, but had he checked
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pathology Department</ENAMEX> he would have
learned that coronary thrombosis occurs in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX>,
not veins, a fact that many laymen without medical
education know, and that it is not â€œfatâ€ that forms on
the wall of coronary arteries but atheromatous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plaque</ENAMEX>.

            Ignorance of anatomy was the cause of a gross
error in an article I read in a travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> on a
recent flight to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.  Writing in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clipper Magazine</ENAMEX> ,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan-Am</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> organ, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Gibbons</ENAMEX> recounts
her experience in drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">slivovitz</ENAMEX> during a
recent trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œA fiery plum brandy</ENAMEX>, its
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> content ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 per cent</NUMEX> ( mekana,
soft) to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 per cent</NUMEX> ( ljuta , hot).  Mine was ljuta , and
it burned a path down my trachea to the pit of my
stomach.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€  Unless Gibbons</ENAMEX> has an uncorrected tracheoesophageal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fistula</ENAMEX> (hardly likely), her trachea is
in continuity with her bronchi and lungs.  If she aspirated
slivovitz into her respiratory tract, she would
be coughing from the time she wrote the article until
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.  One can drink slivovitz, even ljuta , with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">impunity</ENAMEX>, provided it goes down the esophagus.

            Lastly, errors creep in because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> is
making up local color.  This is not unlike reconstructing
a supposed conversation and setting it
down as direct discourse.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Patriarch: The Rise</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fall of the Bingham Family</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Tifft</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alex</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> describe the arrival of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Caperton</ENAMEX>, later
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Barry Bingham</ENAMEX>, Sr., into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radcliffe</ENAMEX>:
â€œIn <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1924</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mary</ENAMEX> climbed aboard a
train with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louise Burleigh</ENAMEX> and set out for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radcliffe</ENAMEX>.
Once in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> motored along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles</ENAMEX>
River, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> were just beginning to take
on their vivid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> color, and then crossed into
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€</ENAMEX>  Not so!  They probably piled their
baggage into a taxi either at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Station</ENAMEX> or Back
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay Station</ENAMEX>, drove out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commonwealth Avenue</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay State Road</ENAMEX>, crossing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX> at any of several
possible <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>.  But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> along both sides
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX> do not begin to turn color until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-October</TIMEX>.
Registration at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radcliffe</ENAMEX> was usually between
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 15th and 20th</TIMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> are
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Yorkers</ENAMEX>, and from some deeply suppressed latent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hostility</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Yorkers</ENAMEX> usually manage to get it
wrong when they write about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX>.
Perhaps they don't speak the same language.

            
               Verba scripta manent , so goes the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> tag, and
the printed word carries weight, even when it is inaccurate.
Even the graffiti in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pompeii</ENAMEX> carry weight
and are subject to scholarly exegesis, though they
were written in haste and there was no leisure to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repent</ENAMEX>.  If there is a moral to these anecdotes, it is
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> cannot be too careful.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> recalls the
advice given by the aged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Joseph Routh</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755-1854</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magdalen College</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>,
to an undergraduate: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œAlways verify your references,
sir<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">!â€ Check</ENAMEX> and double check.  That is why
they put erasers on pencils.
         
         
            There Just Isn't a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Word for It</ENAMEX>



            When the devil gets the upper hand in me,
I like to tease my <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> about some of the words their language
lacks.  I tell them that when a specific word
for a thing or a function is lacking in a language it
must indicate that the thing or the function itself is a
concept that is either unknown or is considered unimportant.

            
               Schedule , for example.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spanish</ENAMEX> doesn't have a
word for it.  You can say timetable (horario) , and you
can proyectar something, or programar it.  But that
is as near as you can come to a one-word translation
of the meaning.  And I have noticed that it is no easier
to find one word in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> that means schedule
than it is to explain to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> the range of
meaning in schedule in addition to that of timetable .

            Speaking of meaning , you can't say â€œDo you
mean that?â€ in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>.  You can say â€œAre you
speaking seriously?â€ which isn't quite the same
thing.  When you want to ask â€œWhat does that word
mean?â€  you can ask â€œWhat does that word signify?â€
or â€œWhat does that word wish to say? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> and thus take
care of that meaning of meaning adequately.  But if
you want to pin a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> down with the
equivalent of this useful term in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, you are
going to have to be content to ask him if he is being
serious, even if he happens to be dying with laughter
over what he has said.

            Are these things clues to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> character
and culture?  I do not know, but they do provide
material for some glorious arguments.  There is no
word for argument in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>, either, in that sense of
the word.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argumento</ENAMEX> is a reasoning, or the plot of a
story or play.  If you had to find one word in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>
for our special meaning you would have to choose
among the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> equivalents of discussion, debate ,
or quarrel , none of which quite hits the mark.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spanish</ENAMEX> has only one word for hope (esperar)
but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">esperar</ENAMEX> also means ` wait ' and ` expect ,' and if the
context is not clear the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> will not
know whether you are waiting for a bus, or expecting
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, or simply hoping that one will come along
eventually.

            There is no exact word for drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>.  For
this term you need to use the word for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fall</TIMEX> , either
with the auxiliary let (lo dejÃ© caer `I let it fall') or in
the reflexive (se me cayÃ³ `it fell itself to me) '.  Either
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>, who can blame you?  In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case you did it
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">purposely</ENAMEX>, and in the other the object did it to you.

            To speak of earning something you must use a
word that also means winning .  The only word for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> is presidente .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairmen</ENAMEX> do preside, of
course, but to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> steeped in a tradition
of civic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTA</ENAMEX> the functions of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> go beyond simply presiding.  To a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>, apparently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> presides,
and that is it.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> had no word for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> , and so eventually
they borrowed ours, and can now often be heard
to speak of a lÃ­der .  On the other hand, we do not
have a word for caudillo .  The nearest we can come
is probably <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> or strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> , but these words do
not encompass the full <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> meaning.

            Which brings us to the subject of words <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>
does have that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> lacks.  Lidiar , for example, is
what a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> does with a bull in a bullring, and to him
the process is not in the remotest sense a fight .  It is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lid</ENAMEX> , and if you do not understand that word you will
not understand him.

            It may surprise anyone whose mind's eye sees
the typical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in a funny hat sleeping
in the shade of a saguaro cactus to learn that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>
can express with one word the concept of `getting
up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning</TIMEX>.'  The verb is madrugar :
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">madrugo</ENAMEX> (`I get up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning</TIMEX>'); madrugas
(`you get up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning</TIMEX>'); madruga (`he
gets up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning</TIMEX>').

            We have borrowed simpÃ¡tico , but I somehow do
not get the same pleasant glow from the word in an
English context that it arouses in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Spanish</TIMEX> speech.

            Street demonstrations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX> resound
with simple cries we simply cannot duplicate in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.!
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viva la patria</ENAMEX>!  (`<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hurrah for the fatherland'</ENAMEX>?)
!<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mueran los</ENAMEX> demÃ³cratacristianos!  (`Kill the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>'?) !Solidaridad!  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Poles</ENAMEX> would understand
that, but not we <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>.

            In contrast to the rather standoffish attitude of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> is on familiar terms
with the deity and things holy or revered.  Why not
name your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>?  Or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John of God</ENAMEX>?  You can
name him <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Mary or Paul Mary</ENAMEX> , and nobody
will think the less of him.  And why not call your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">daughter Conception</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrows</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dolores</ENAMEX>)?  Or why
not search the calendar of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> and holy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> for
names for the newborn?  I have even heard of country
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CircuncisiÃ³n</ENAMEX> , but I have never met
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.

            We are hard put to bring into normal English
the diminutive endings that tend to adorn <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>
discourse with such interesting furbelows: caballito,
mujercita, amiguito, autito .  There is no hesitancy
about using even a double diminutive, as in chiquitito.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chico</ENAMEX> would be `little,' chiquito would be `tiny,'
or perhaps `teeny-weeny,' and chiquitito could only
be `teensy-weensy,' I suppose.

            In his Growth and Structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otto Jespersen</ENAMEX> noted how few diminutives
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English</ENAMEX> has, and how little it uses them.  He thought
that the use of diminutives â€œproduces the impression
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> are innocent, childish, genial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX>, with no great business capacities or seriousness
in life.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€  Jespersen</ENAMEX> may have overstated the
case, but there is no doubt that whereas no <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX>
male would hesitate to call a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> a chanchito ,
few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> would care to be heard calling
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">piglet</ENAMEX> .

            Nor, at the other end of the scale, can we match
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> superlative <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">suffix - Ã­simo</ENAMEX> , e.g., grandÃ­simo,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">altÃ­simo</ENAMEX>, bellÃ­simo (rendered in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as the `biggest,'
the `highest,' the `most beautiful,' although for
an exact equivalency one would use the other superlative
form in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>, mÃ¡s grande, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mÃ¡s alto</ENAMEX>, mÃ¡s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bello</ENAMEX> ).  Nothing I have ever heard in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> can
match the breadth of lighthearted insult expressed by
a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> wit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years ago</TIMEX> who used the suffix with
reference to the notoriously pampered, well-connected,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">well-heeled</ENAMEX>, well-placed brother-in-law
( cu
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ã±ado</ENAMEX> ) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco Franco</ENAMEX>.  He called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">generalissimo</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brother-in-law el cuÃ±adÃ­simo</ENAMEX> .

            When your language can do that, who cares
whether it can schedule things or hope for them, or
drop them?

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Power of Doubled Words</ENAMEX>



            In a recent column on etymologies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attorney General</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Thornburgh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Cheney</ENAMEX> were cited for their use of willynilly
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Monthly</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1990</TIMEX>).  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Thornburgh</ENAMEX>
stated that â€œhe did not favor a `willy-nilly' <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military
commitmentâ€ in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX>
â€œdecried ... `willy-nilly' cuts in defense spending
proposed by some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX>.â€

            By using willy-nilly rather than more formal
terms such as â€œwhether desired or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">notâ€</NUMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage Dictionary</ENAMEX> ), they were turning to a minor
word pattern in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> called `reduplication,' meaning
a partial or complete duplication of a given word.
Many languages use this doubling pattern, some extensively.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hawaiian</ENAMEX>, having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only fourteen</NUMEX> letters in
its alphabet, resorts to doubling frequently.  Some examples
are lahi `thin, frail,' lahilahi `weak' (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>) and wiki `hurry,' wikiwiki `hurry up.'

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reduplication</ENAMEX> uses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> devices that help make
language powerful and memorable--rhyme and
rhythm.  Also, the usage level of English doubles is
usually informal or colloquial; and when placed in a
context of standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, a double can make a
sentence sparkle.

            Among the several types of doubles in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, a
rather large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> ends both parts with the diminutive
suffix - y or - ie .  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> seems also to contain
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-groups</ENAMEX> that produce opposite effects:
those that diminish size and express endearment
or amusement and those that diminish stature
or worth and express disapproval or contempt.
Among the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> group are many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s words--
Georgy-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Porgy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henny-Penny</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lurkey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">kitchy-kitchy</ENAMEX>,
lippity-lippity, piggly-wiggly .  Among the second
are fuddy-duddy, funny-money, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">hoity-toity</ENAMEX>,
hokey-pokey, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">namby-pamby</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">shilly-shally</ENAMEX>, silly-billy,
ticky-tacky, wishy-washy , and the double cited
above, willy-nilly .  The power gained through rhyme
and rhythm seems to be directed by the diminutive
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suffix</ENAMEX> toward favorable or unfavorable meanings.

            During the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> scandal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>
had to face an even more powerful combination, one
that incorporated his own nickname in a double that
ended with the negative diminutive - y .  Whoever
coined the term tricky-dicky must have sensed that
the combination would hit hard.

            Perhaps the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, or
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, were aware of objections to the positions
attributed to them and decided to take the initiative,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thornburgh</ENAMEX> by distancing himself from those
favoring a `willy-nilly' commitment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> by blaming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> for urging `willy-nilly' proposals to cut the
defense budget.
         
         
            Jâ€”y ... Bang!




            Those interested in the magic of onomasiology
might note the following full names with the initial

            Tragedies are not limited to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œJ</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">yâ€</ENAMEX> phenomenon,

            The article by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bryson</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVII</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>] on the vagaries
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> abroad unfortunately also serves to
illustrate the lack of linguistic understanding which
exists between our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.

            Specifically, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> illustration given is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œFull-O-Pep</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laying Mash</ENAMEX>,â€ which is presented as if it were a
nonsense phrase.  In fact, of course, â€œFull-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O-Pepâ</ENAMEX>€
and many variations thereon were, and perhaps still
are, common trade names of a variety of animal feed
products.  And laying mash, as any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> knows, is a
form of chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">feed</ENAMEX> so formulated as to enhance egg
production.  In the cited example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">feed</ENAMEX> manufacturer
was even named--which should have been a
clue to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, although the terminal part of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phrase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1091 DS</ENAMEX>) admittedly baffles me.

            One wonders whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bryson</ENAMEX>
who wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Lost Continent--Travels in Small</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Town America</ENAMEX> .  If so, the mistake is doubly surprising,
as that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BB</ENAMEX> was born (?) and raised in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>, then
moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>.

            I am addressing this to you since I don't have
the address of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> of original publication
( The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Independent</ENAMEX> ), and hope that word may eventually
drift back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>.
