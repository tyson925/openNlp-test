            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poet Muriel Rukeyser</ENAMEX> envisions <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Oedipus ‚Äúold</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blinded‚Äù</ENAMEX> asking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sphinx</ENAMEX> why he hadn't recognized
his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>.  It was, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sphinx</ENAMEX> explains, his
answer to the riddle: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúMan.</ENAMEX>‚Äù



‚Äú... You didn't say anything about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen you say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Man,‚Äù</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oedipus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúyou</ENAMEX> include
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> too.  Everyone knows that.‚Äù  She said,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúThat</ENAMEX>'s what you think.‚Äù
            

            Were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oedipus</ENAMEX> alive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> he might offer the same
solution to the riddle.  But he would indeed be feigning
na√Øvet√© to claim that generic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is now understood to
include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.  Even the most casual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> of social
movements and language changes are conscious of what
some might call the crusade for nonsexist language.
(Careful feminist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> avoid unthinking use of imagery
redolent of colonialism and militarism.)  Though the Seneca
Falls convention of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1848</TIMEX> noted and deplored the silence
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Declaration of Independence</ENAMEX>
and though nonfeminists have worked toward removing
sexism from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, most current activity stems from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s movement that began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Feminists</ENAMEX> concerned about language relentlessly
reveal language's capacity to discriminate against
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> or to render them invisible.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poking</ENAMEX> and prodding
at contemporary speech and writing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX>
condemn the use of a term identified with one sex or
gender to designate all humanity.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">(‚ÄúGender‚Äù</ENAMEX> is preferred
to ‚Äúsex‚Äù in designating the cultural construct
rather than the purely biological.  However, some recent
studies explore the connection between development
of linguistic gender and sex/gender, and the
question of anatomically determined language is fashionable.)
Mankind tacitly imposes male values on all of
humanity; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manhours</ENAMEX> denies women's work as a measure;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manpower</ENAMEX> effaces <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.  So, too, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX>
lobby for gender-neutral terms when appropriate.  A
familiar example: reasoning that in terms of job duties
the sex or gender of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who passes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanuts</ENAMEX> on
an airplane is unimportant, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Handbook</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Nonsexist Language</ENAMEX> propose flight attendant rather
than steward/stewardess and oppose gratuitous regendering
of job titles ( female flight attendant ).  (A
court case notes a male purser and a female stewardess
with identical job descriptions, but different salary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scales</ENAMEX>.)  Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> discourage titles that identify
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s (but not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s) marital status (though
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> mistakenly assume Ms . a synonym for
Miss ).

            More generally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> reveal and question implied
norms in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> and hence in our consciousness,
ranging from the application form's unmarried
which suggests that marriage is the normal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> (as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> imply double births expected, referring
to non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> as singletons ) to more complex issues,
such as those associated with terms like masculine
and feminine .  Anomalies in language become
evidence.  What to make of the fact that one may be
henpecked but not cockpecked?  That some of us are
cleaning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> , but none of us is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúgarbage gentleman‚Äù</ENAMEX>?
That girls , a term suggesting youth but not
dignity, have been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> of any age, but the call on
television's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electric Company</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄúHey, you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX>,‚Äù summons
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> alike?

            The hypothetical modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oedipus</ENAMEX> might join
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genders</ENAMEX> who carp at the most
radical-seeming alterations of the language.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Opponents</ENAMEX>
of nonsexist language show passionate loyalty to
principles of etymology and tradition and unexpected
respect for grace and style (admittedly frequent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>
of inclusion of the feminine pronoun).  More subtle
and less readily articulated objections probably exist.
But few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> of nonsexist language are
ignorant of the claims of etymology, of custom, of
aesthetics, or even of the inappropriateness of gender-neutral
terms in a nongender neutral world.  For them,
as for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX>, political considerations are primary.
This explains support of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúherstory‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äú`wim-min,‚Äù
terms that finesse etymology to emphasize the
male-orientation of conventional history and to eliminate
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in the word <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> .  (When etymology
serves political concerns etymology is honored.  For example,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> cites a preference for cunt over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vagina</TIMEX> ,
because of the latter's derivation from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
word meaning `sheath,' often sheath for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword</ENAMEX>.)  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">feminist</ENAMEX> position recognizes the power of language.
Language is viewed not only as the product but the
shaper of culture and as such is able to perpetuate or
discourage discrimination or oppression.  (In spite of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symphony</ENAMEX> auditions of barefoot, screened <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> hymnals laced with maternal imagery for God,
commencement addresses to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúWomen and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX>,‚Äù affirmative action and the resulting tokenism,
few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> think the cause won.  Attitudes toward
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, often assumed to be natural and hence sacred,
are not easily changed.)  Nonsexist language is no universal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antidote</ENAMEX>.  But most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX>, even recognizing
the influence of preverbal and nonverbal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> and
various sexist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>, see acceptance of sexist language
as an insidious poison.

            This retreading of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, this adjusting of it,
altering it, bandaging, and plastering it to promote a
particular vision of society is the most widely perceived
activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX>.  But
it is arguably the simplest philosophically and, though
this is relatively unimportant, the least attractive.  (A
familiar but irrelevant complaint against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> is
that they lack charm, as though an unappealing style
negates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> of a cause.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rukeyser</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sphinx</ENAMEX> was
not very affable, either.)  After all, those who undertake
this dirty work are necessarily <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">naysayers</ENAMEX>, rule-givers,
censors of the word rather than bringers of it.
Generally anti-elitist and anti-authoritarian by declaration,
feminist alterers of language find themselves
corralled with prescriptive grammarians and linguists.

            The issue of nonsexist language envisions <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> as subject (or object) of language.  Yet this is
but one aspect of gender and linguistics, a subject that
has its own conferences, bibliographies, and college
courses.  As literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> look not only at
images of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in literature but at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>.  So those interested in language look at
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> not only as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, but also as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX>.  Such inquiry is less direct and
more exploratory than nonsexist language promotion,
but is no less political.  Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorists</ENAMEX> describe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s
relation to language as primarily a product of patriarchal
oppression; others, usually acknowledging oppression,
focus on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s strengths.

            Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>, feminist and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nonfeminist</ENAMEX> alike,
agree that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s vernacular differs from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s: Jespersen
listed adjectives favored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, noted
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s use of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúlittle‚Äù intensifiers</ENAMEX>.  Feminists ponder
causes, implications.  Does the close adherence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of all classes to accepted proper norms suggest
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repression</ENAMEX>?  Their conservatism?  Their
upward mobility?  What attitude should <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> take
to women's suggested more frequent use of tag endings
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">(‚ÄúIt</ENAMEX>'s a nice day, isn't it<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">?‚Äù  ‚</ENAMEX>ÄúWe'll vote <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX>,
won't we?‚Äù)?  Identified by early feminist linguist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robin</ENAMEX>
Lakoff, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s frequent use of tag endings has been
both discounted by some but not all empirical studies
and re-examined by other studies that distinguish different
kinds of tag endings used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
Those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> who emphasize success within the
world as we know it tend to encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to
purge their speech of tag endings and to retrain themselves
to speak in what is perceived as a more masculine,
more assertive way.  Others, emphasizing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s
particular values, urge retention of this and other features
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s talk (for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> frequently
assume noncompetitive roles in conversation), suggesting
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s talk encourages participation and
the likelihood of consensus.

            Such analyses of language pass as traditional in
form if not in content.  They echo the old question,
posed regularly by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX>, anthropologists, and
linguists, as to whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> speak (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">or ‚Äúchatter,‚Äù a</ENAMEX>
word used only for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> and nonhumans) a different
language, a dialect, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúgenderlect‚Äù</ENAMEX> with each other
and with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, whether they can, do, or should speak
what the title of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Spender</ENAMEX>'s book calls <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Man Made</ENAMEX>
Language .  The answers often appear in measured, academic
prose.  When offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX>, the answers
frequently appear in a style that is marked by word
play dependent on written forms; a style that is unconventional,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mannered</ENAMEX>, at its best witty; a style that
suggests alternatives to those styles that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX>
would designate male-influenced.  For it is no praise
for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> to be included within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the best</TIMEX> accepted
(for which, read ‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Äúmale-endorsed‚Äù</NUMEX>) tradition.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Admittedly</ENAMEX>, no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> completely purges its rhetoric of
terms like phallologocentric, however.)  Such a style
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marks</ENAMEX> both a reference work, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Feminist Dictionary</ENAMEX> ,
and the writings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theologian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Daly</ENAMEX>.

            
               A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Feminist Dictionary</ENAMEX> , edited by influential
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheris Kramarae</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paula Treichler</ENAMEX> along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ann</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russo</ENAMEX>, suggests the style and the substance of some
recent feminist discourse.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> disclaim objectivity.
Yet, they imply, conventional lexicographers are
not objective, though they neither recognize nor admit
it.  For example, in lexicographers' frequent reliance on
‚Äúbest authors‚Äù as a source, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> draw evidence
from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, more frequently published and admired,
and not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.  Other significant editorial practices:
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feminist Dictionary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lexicogaphers</ENAMEX> refuse to label a
word like herstory a coinage.  All words are coinages,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> claim, and they resist charting relations
between their entries and an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúauthorized‚Äù</ENAMEX> or canonized
list of words.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feminist Dictionary</ENAMEX> includes new
words and new definitions; words from utopian literature
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">suggest ‚Äúwhat</ENAMEX> might be‚Äù; definitions are elaborate,
the stated aim to stimulate research or theoretical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>.

            Under ‚ÄúA,‚Äù for example, the lexicographers provide
entries for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX> feminam, ageism, ‚ÄúAin't I a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woman‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sojourner Truth</ENAMEX>'s speech), and amniocentesis .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúZ‚Äù</ENAMEX> is limited to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> entries: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zamani Soweto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeitgeist</ENAMEX> (`<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Spirit</ENAMEX> of liberty, equality, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sorority</ENAMEX>'),
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zugassent</ENAMEX> (a term for male continence as
practised by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oneida</ENAMEX> utopian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>).  Under
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúL</ENAMEX>,‚Äù entries include <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> , defined by Aphra
Behn, cited in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Spender</ENAMEX>'s book, as `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Secret</ENAMEX> codes
supplied through an education traditionally denied
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.'  Another entry under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laadan</ENAMEX> , a language
constructed by linguist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzette Hayden Elgin</ENAMEX> and first
used in her science fiction novel <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Tongue</ENAMEX> , a language
which is designed to contain many ‚Äúwoman
function‚Äù words not included in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> linguist
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deborah Cameron in Feminism</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linguistic</ENAMEX>
Theory doubts these lacunae, suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
is flexible, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are disadvantaged primarily
by alienation from high language.)

            The energetic defining and developing of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">woman</ENAMEX>'s language, the inevitable doubting and questioning
of it, is energized by the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX>,
and is displayed in the verbal acrobatics of radical
feminist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theologian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Daly</ENAMEX>.  For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daly</ENAMEX>
describes the title of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of her early books,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gyn/Ecology</ENAMEX> , as saying ‚Äúexactly what I mean to say.‚Äù  It
is ‚Äúa way of wrenching back some wordpower,‚Äù and in
a way not ‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Äúa-mazing‚Äù</NUMEX> (a typical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> twirl of language
to make the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> re-examine words) to our ‚Äúfore-sisters
who/were the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Hags</ENAMEX>,‚Äù terms used in unconventional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tacitly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX>, like most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX>,
invokes an earlier, quieter voice, that of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolf</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolf</ENAMEX> identified but did not describe ‚Äúa
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">woman</ENAMEX>'s sentence‚Äù and, in the same text, wrote of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women ancestors</ENAMEX> (for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s putative
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>) who was silent, silenced by a society dominated
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX>'s language is often metonymy for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s literary style.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolf</ENAMEX> here suggests <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> lines of
thought currently pursued by feminist linguists; feminists
both seek to describe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s language and to
explore the cluster of related conditions summarized
under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rubric ‚Äúsilence</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  The discussion by women
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s language is lively; the discussion of the
related and complementary topic, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s silence, is
elaborate, complex, and a bit sad.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tillie Olsen</ENAMEX> identifies
silent periods when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are diverted from their
work by needs of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spender</ENAMEX> talks of ‚Äúsilence
upon silence‚Äù that has kept women's experience
from being encoded; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adrienne Rich</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">On Lies</ENAMEX>,
Secrets and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silences</ENAMEX> , sees women's struggle for self-determination
‚Äúmuffled or silenced over and over‚Äù;
most recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra Gilbert</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Gubar</ENAMEX> chart
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women authors</ENAMEX>' apparent alienation from language,
their frequent use of pseudonyms an attempt at renaming
or, really, naming themselves.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Feminists</ENAMEX> have
much to say about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s claim that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> talk too
much.  To many, it is significant that the privilege of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">naming</ENAMEX>, granted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam</ENAMEX>, was denied to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Eve</TIMEX>.

            Modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> may be
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">sisters to Rukeyser's Sphinx</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sphinx</ENAMEX> may be silent,
as in many traditions, or not, but she and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oedipus</ENAMEX>,
who did not recognize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of either gender, probably
do not understand the same language.
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Handbook of Nonsexist Writing</ENAMEX>
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nonsexist Word Finder</ENAMEX>

            The subject of nonsexist language is a matter of
genuine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>, not only to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of this
issue] but to everyone.  It ill behooves us to be unfair to
any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, and it is not only immoral
but illegal to discriminate against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on
virtually any basis.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent decades</TIMEX>, certain changes
have taken place in the language that reflect voluntary
choices of the words used to characterize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>; these
have focused largely on the conscious and conscientious
substitution of neutral, sexless words like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>(s),
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for terms that normally denote
only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Journalists</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX> have
sometimes taken a facetious view of the situation, suggesting
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> , itself, is sexist because -<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> denotes
`male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX>,' that words like manhole are sexist,
and that even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> ( wo + <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> ) is sexist.  By this
time the humor, if there was any there to begin with,
has worn very thin, indeed, and the end of it would be
welcome.  Then, too, there have been the campaigners
who have gone to what some regard as opposite extremes:
if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> is known to be a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairwoman</ENAMEX> must
surely be the proper denotation; if the sex of the person
is not known, then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairperson</ENAMEX> , though awkward-sounding,
is the preferred form.  But it is patently ridiculous
to refer to someone whose sex is known as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairperson</ENAMEX> .  Chair should be reserved for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairperson</ENAMEX>, not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> holding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>.  Yet,
many prefer chair to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairperson</ENAMEX> on the grounds of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brevity</ENAMEX> and because it avoids the awkwardness of the
longer alternative.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swift</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">M&S</ENAMEX>] treat this
problem and seem to believe that it has been solved:



The lexicographer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alma Graham</ENAMEX> points out that
chair has been recognized, in the sense of ‚Äúthe occupant
of the chair ... as invested with its dignity,‚Äù
since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventeenth century</TIMEX> just as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crown</ENAMEX> has been used for the monarch, or the Oval
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX> has come to stand for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>.  ‚ÄúAddress your remarks to the chair‚Äù
illustrates metonymy, a figure of speech in which
something is called by the name of something else
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with it.  Nobody understands an injunction
to ‚Äúaddress the chair‚Äù as an order to talk to a
piece of furniture.  [pp. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33-34</NUMEX>]
            

            The final sentence is about as valid as would be the
comment that nobody understands such an injunction
as an order to write the address of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairperson</ENAMEX> on a
dozen envelopes, either.  But there are other specious
arguments in the above statement:

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)  Recognized ?  By whom?  The fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX>
has found that citations for such usage exist (how old
they may be is of little consequence) is not to be construed
as evidence that they (necessarily) existed in
sufficient profusion to warrant acceptance by the English-speaking
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.  Moreover, what are the contexts
in which the citations were found?  There are
many difficulties inherent in adducing citational evidence
unsupported by frequency.  There are many
other instances of the misuses of citational evidence,
not only by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of dictionaries but by lexicographers
themselves: there is no way, using the citational materials
at present appearing in dictionaries as prima facie
evidence, that one would be justified in assuming that
a broad statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> is
thereby represented; even the most cursory examination
of entries in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> (which I assume to be the
source of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX>'s information) will rapidly, ineluctably
lead the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> to realize that



a)  the evidence in the published work is quite thin,
and

b)  the conclusions drawn by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX>'s definers
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX> often cannot be supported by
citational evidence‚Äîat least, not the citational
evidence that appears in the published work.
            

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)  That chair is used metonymically in the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crown</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oval Office</ENAMEX> is true, but to
refer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, not to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> occupying it.
Certainly, in the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crown</ENAMEX> , as ample evidence
will show, reference is so made specifically to avoid
mentioning a particular regent and not as a figure of
speech employed for rhetorical effect.  As for the Oval
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX> , it is mostly used when the referent is `authority
of the executive branch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>' to avoid
identifying the (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">incumbent</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> personally and
to indicate official policy.  In both cases, the point is
exactly opposite that identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX>: it is the
position, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>, etc. being referred to
and not ‚Äúthe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupant</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  By the same token, when people
address the chair , they address the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, whoever
might hold it, and not the incumbent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>.

            I find little to dispute with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M&S</ENAMEX> in the matter of
principle.  But there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> elements of their argument
that merit further comment.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is that I
find their interpretation of the evidence often skewed;
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is that while adjustment to lexicon, which
they have always strongly advocated, is one thing,
modification of grammar is another.

            In referring to an item in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York Times</ENAMEX> in
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> is used to refer to a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, M&S
write:



Though the term may once have been anomalous
when used of a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it is a recognized
common-gender noun, and the next round of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionaries</ENAMEX> will no doubt add their authority to
the change.  [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p. 6</ENAMEX>]
            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">First Edition of The Random House Dictionary of</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX> lists <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> with a definition, ‚Äúa
young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, esp. a young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">man‚Äù</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Edition</ENAMEX>,
published after the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">M&S Handbook</ENAMEX> and, presumably,
in the ‚Äúnext round‚Äù they refer to, defines the word as
‚Äúa young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, esp. a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> or male adolescent.‚Äù
Thus the evidence at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> indicated
the need for reinforcement of the notion of maleness
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the word, not, as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">M&S</ENAMEX> suggest, a trend
toward epicenism.  I am not entirely in agreement with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RHD</ENAMEX> treatment, for, personally, I believe that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> has lately appeared more and more often in
context like youth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, youth rehabilitation , etc.,
where the context is clearly common-gender, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foregoing</ENAMEX> is merely set out as a warning to those who
try to predict what lexicographers are likely to do.  On
the other hand, I do not have the hard evidence at
hand and assume that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHD</ENAMEX> does.

            The following appears, in bold italics, on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>:



To go on using in its former sense a word whose
meaning has changed is counterproductive.  The
point is not that we should recognize semantic
change, but that in order to be precise, in order to
be understood, we must.
            

            I am not sure that I should have characterized the
perpetuation of obsolete or archaic meanings as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúcounterproductive‚Äù</ENAMEX>:
perhaps ‚Äúwrong,<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äù ‚Äúmisleading,‚Äù ‚Äúambiguous,‚Äù</ENAMEX>
or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äúold-fashioned‚</NUMEX>Äù would have been closer to
the mark; phrased another way, I must agree that people
ought to use words in their current senses if they
expect to be understood.  Most do, of course, use them
that way.  When will <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> learn that dictionaries are
not the product of the collective imaginations of those
who prepare them or the manifestations of the dreams
of a single lexicographer but the result of lengthy,
painstaking research to determine how the language is
being used, the analysis and codification of the results,
and then their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> into a usable reference
source?  What is ‚Äúcounterproductive‚Äù is the notion that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of a language have to recognize semantic
change: they don't ‚Äúrecognize‚Äù it, they create it.  Of
course, if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> tampers with the evidence,
making a unilateral, unsupported claim or assumption
that a word means something that it does not, then
that does not constitute semantic change: it is what is
known as dirty work at the crossroads, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M&S</ENAMEX> are
indulging in a bit of mischief by suggesting that semantic
change either has taken place or is taking place
because they have some evidence that a certain change
in usage had crept in.  Notwithstanding the unfortunate
fact that the gathering and assessment of citational
evidence is not what it should (or might) be, I
should still put my money on professional lexicographers
and their resources rather than on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M&S</ENAMEX>.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äú Man as a False Generic,‚Äù</ENAMEX> M&S
question whether the definitions <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äú2</NUMEX>. the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX> , at the highest level of animal development,
characterized esp. by a highly developed brain.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.  the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX> ...‚Äù [from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College Edition</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHD</ENAMEX> ] are ‚Äústill fully operative
or whether the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, limited meaning [`an adult male
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, as distinguished from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.'] has,
in effect, become the only valid one in modern <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
I trust that this is a fillip of propaganda and not
a serious query.  To be sure, it is the most common
meaning, which is why it is listed <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>.  But one must
contend not only with the way the word might be used
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> but with the evidence of centuries of culture
reflected in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> upon billions upon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> of
words of text all of which shape the way we think and
speak.  There is nothing wrong with trying to change
that shape, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> of nonsexist <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> have
worked miracles in the short time since they have succeeded
in making their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> known.  But to deny
that the oblique senses of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> are still very much with
us is mere optimistic folly.  And there is no gainsaying
the fact that the first sense of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> (`male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human</ENAMEX>')
tends to contaminate (if that is the right word) the
oblique senses.  But grammar enters the picture here,
too, and dictionaries are remiss in syntactic description
of how the language works in comparison with what
its words mean, how they are spelled and pronounced,
and where they came from.  To put it differently, it is
not (yet) the function of the dictionary to show that
articles (definite or indefinite) are not usually found
preceding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in senses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 3</NUMEX> but are invariably
present before sense <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> uses.  No normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> of English
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">encountering Man</ENAMEX> wants but little here below
wonders‚Äîexcept facetiously‚Äîwhy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have been
ignored.  More likely, they read wants as meaning
`desires' rather than `lacks,' but that might well be a
deliberate, facetious ambiguity.  We use terms like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Neanderthal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Man, Peking Man</ENAMEX> , etc., without believing
for a moment that there were no <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Neanderthal</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peking</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (leaving aside <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peking Toms</ENAMEX>).  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Cartoonists</ENAMEX>
might depict a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> asking a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Neanderthal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, but that is recognizably a joke that depends
for its humor on the characterization of the
questioner as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fool</ENAMEX>: that it is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is irrelevant; it
might be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edith Bunker</ENAMEX>.  Perhaps the most significant
comment on the failure to distinguish between man
generic and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> `male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human</ENAMEX>' appears on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>:



When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edith Bunker</ENAMEX>, on the television series ‚ÄúAll
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family,‚Äù</ENAMEX> quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Walter Foss</ENAMEX>'s

‚ÄúLet me live in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> by the side of the
road

And be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>,‚Äù

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archie</ENAMEX>'s response was, ‚ÄúYeah, I heard about them
kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
            

            Is it possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M&S</ENAMEX> are serious in invoking Archie
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bunker</ENAMEX>, the archbigot of all time, as a model of understanding
and a paragon of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">English</ENAMEX> usage?
There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many thousands</NUMEX> of such jokes in every language,
for they depend for their humor on polysemy or
homonymy, which exists in all languages.  Yet, this
nonsense is compounded.



<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lexicographers</ENAMEX> appear to agree.  Although they
do not label the supposedly generic meaning of
man obsolete, they write some definitions as
though we all know it is.  For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>) defines a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">man</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúwordly</ENAMEX> and socially active
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  But if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> sometimes means ‚Äúany human
being,‚Äù should not the definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX>-town
read ‚Äúa wordly and socially active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> of
the male sex‚Äù?  How can the definers be sure we
will know without being told that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX>-town
is never a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>?  [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p. 8</ENAMEX>]
            

            On the face of it, one might dismiss this question as
just so much rubbish and wonder how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence of M&S</ENAMEX> could possibly have come to frame
it.  The answer has nothing to do with their cause,
however, but with the simple fact that dictionaries are
not exercises in bi-unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">substitutability</ENAMEX>; in other
words, if one of the senses of run is `operate' (as in She
runs an engine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> ), that does not make it valid to
assume that one can substitute operate for run in We
run in the marathon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> .  Although recognizing
this as a shortcoming of dictionaries and assigning it
arbitrarily to what, for lack of a better term, we might
call the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúgenius‚Äù</ENAMEX> of the language, might seem trivial to
the casual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX>, it is a valid matter for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> in
the realm of lexicology.  Using it to bolster an argument
is plainly a mistake.  Unfortunately, the mistake is compounded
and perpetuated by dragging in expressions
like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, the average working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> , and
others, and, as a result, the entire argument degenerates.
Perhaps we ought to be saying street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> for
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and working stiff for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, but the first
has been pre-empted and it seems a little incongruous
to find anyone actively seeking to be called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äústiff</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            There are actually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> things at work in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Handbook</ENAMEX> : <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> is a genuine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>, when a generalized
statement about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> is to be made, about being
unfair to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> through the use of references
which, though denotatively neutral, carry the strong
scent of maleness.  That is, if you are going to say
something about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, then avoid using the word
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">man</ENAMEX> (for example) because, regardless of the ancillary
definitions one might find in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>, in its most
common meaning and use it denotes `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX>' and the
strong connotations of that denotation are carried over
to all other applications of the word: it is not, in fact,
as neutral as some believe it to be.  If that is what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M&S</ENAMEX>
mean, why don't they just say so?  The other thing is
that generalized statements employing reference to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> constitute a not-so-subtle form of propaganda
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interpretable</ENAMEX> either as pro-male, anti-female, or both.

            (A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> possibility, though naturally not treated
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M&S</ENAMEX>, is out-and-out misanthropy vs. misogyny, for
the notion of simple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>-hating should not be ruled
out entirely.  As a male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>, I get strong vibrations
from this book that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> advocate the paranoid
view that everything in the language that is not exactly
as they would like it to be is the result of a gigantic
hate program against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.  In that context, one is
given to wonder about the circumstances in languages
that have grammatical, not sex gender.)

            The remainder of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 1</ENAMEX> is mainly a catalogue
of misinterpretations, aberrations, and plain errors regarding
the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> as a generic.  A number of
excellent suggestions to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> avoid the inadvertent
expression of prejudice are offered, albeit interspersed
among excoriating, castigatory comments that
are entirely irrelevant to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Cause</ENAMEX>, hence diminish
the impact and strength of purpose of both.  It is indeed
a pity that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> persist in expressing their
ideas as they do, for were they more practical and not
so aggressively all-inclusive in their condemnation of
the slightest hint of maleness, they would probably
serve their cause more successfully.

            Curiously, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British English</ENAMEX> (of all things!) has provided
a solution of sorts to the perennial ancillary
problem of the ‚Äúneutral he ‚Äù as the pronoun of reference
in the language.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British English</ENAMEX> it is no longer
considered a solecism to use the plurals they, their,
them, theirs as a generalized pronoun for words like
eyeryone, everybody, anyone, anybody , etc.  Thus, it
has become standard (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> to say or write,
Everyone can get their copy at the bookshop, Everybody
should make certain to take their own coat , etc.  I
don't know about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, etc., but in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> this kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">referent</ENAMEX> usage is considered a heinous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">illiteracy</ENAMEX> (by those who consider such matters), and
those who wish to appear educated would be wise to
avoid it.  It scarcely needs pointing out that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
usage was not brought about by any sense of justice
toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> but by the apparent fact that the people
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> are not quite as uptight about usage as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Handbook</ENAMEX> is
devoted in its entirety to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Pronoun Problem</ENAMEX>, mercifully
concluding with the expression of some doubt
that an artificial generic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pronoun</ENAMEX>, like hir, thon, per ,
and other abominations, is likely to take hold.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 3, Generalizations</ENAMEX>, treats with good
sense methods that can be employed to avoid sexism in
a wide variety of constructions.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M&S</ENAMEX> continue to
take up the cudgel, carping against writing which, in
some cases, antedates recognition of a problem: it is
like nattering on about how awful the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> were
because they condoned slavery; rather a waste of
space, time, and motion, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wot</ENAMEX>?  Much that might have
been offered with sober good advice here is contaminated
by an obsessive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> with the identification
of the sex of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perpetrator</ENAMEX> of past injustices.  The
approach is vindictive and castigatory.  Other libertarian
movements advocate similar policies: it is not
enough that wrongs be righted; the discrimination and
other injustices suffered by past <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>, back
through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ages</TIMEX>, must be avenged, and the descendants
of those responsible must be made to pay for
those crimes and somehow to compensate the descendants
of the sufferers.  Such policies are not only
asinine, they are‚Äîand here I have found another appropriate
place for the buzz word of the decade‚Äî
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">counterproductive</ENAMEX>: the energies expended on vengeance
are entirely wasted and should be channeled to
changing the present system to ensure that they are not
continued.  Although we continue to track down
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> who did their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>, we do business
with and carry on other normal relations with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazis</ENAMEX> and of those who bombed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearl Harbor</ENAMEX>.  The sins of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forebears</ENAMEX> should not be
visited upon us.  In the same way, those who support
equal rights for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> would be well advised to concentrate
on the issues at hand and not contaminate
their cause with trivia, like whether <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Romeo and Juliet</ENAMEX>
or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antony</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cleopatra</ENAMEX> ought to have the order of
the names reversed in odd-numbered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> so that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> get top billing.  While that has not been literally
proposed (as far as I know), the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s
names appear first has been used by some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> to
illustrate the manifestation of an attitude that women
have had to put up with all these <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>.

            Seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women and Girls</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 4</ENAMEX>,
settles down to some good advice, describing what
might be offensive to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and how to get around it
through paraphrase.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M&S</ENAMEX> also go out of their way to
praise usages that neatly sidestep offensive usage.  Specific
cliches‚Äî working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">etc.‚Äîare</ENAMEX> discussed, with sober explanations of
why they are offensive and with suggestions for suitable
alternatives.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 5</ENAMEX> covers <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Parallel Treatment</ENAMEX>, quite properly
bearing down on descriptions in which ‚Äúa man
and his petite blonde <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wife‚</ENAMEX>Äù appear.  They go too far,
though, when they attack ‚ÄúI lost my job‚Äù in place of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúThey</ENAMEX> fired me‚Äù on the grounds that such phrasing
contributes to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúthe harmful stereotype of `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX>.' ‚Äù  What unmitigated nonsense!  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> say that,
too, of course.  To be fair, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M&S</ENAMEX> also criticize identifications
(mainly from news stories) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> as ‚Äúmother
of five‚Äù and other gratuitous characterizations that are
not only irrelevant to the item's newsworthiness but are
rarely offered about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 6</ENAMEX> discusses, under <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Few More Words</ENAMEX>, a
number of suffixes ( -trix, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-ess</ENAMEX> , etc.) and words ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>/
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">heroine, alumnus/alumna/alumni/alumnae</ENAMEX> , etc.) that
apparently offend the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>: they campaign for the
elimination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la diff√©rence</ENAMEX> .  My own attitude is that I
find such terms not in the least denigrating: Why
should a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> object to being called a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">divorc√©e</ENAMEX>, or an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> any more than being called a
female or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>?  I see the rather boring point
about using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumni</ENAMEX> to cover both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
and I quite agree that the use of relatively newer and
less widely used terms like authoress, aviatrix , and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poetess</ENAMEX> seems to be a deliberate, unwarranted attempt
to identify someone as a female; but a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> of the
feminine gender is a `woman <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX>' = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumna</ENAMEX> , the
`<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman dancer</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ballet company</ENAMEX>' is a prima
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ballerina</ENAMEX> (I've never heard of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúprime ballerino‚Äù</ENAMEX>), and
a `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> opera <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>' is a diva or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prima donna</ENAMEX> .  I
hesitate to point out that we use prima donna of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>,
too, because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> will say that they disapprove of
the term's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> life as designating a ‚Äútemperamental
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> of either sex.'  These, of course, are loanwords
borrowed from languages that have (or had) grammatical
gender.  The same is true of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousands</NUMEX>
of other words.  What are we to do?  The answer is not
clear unless we accept a policy of drawing up a (very)
long list of taboo words.  A short list is not impossible,
for it would join words like nigger, kike, mackerelsnapper ,
and others.

            The book concludes with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Brief Thesaurus</ENAMEX>,
which lists a few offending words and their suggested
alternatives.  If this were indeed to have been a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">handbook</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> would have found a longer list more useful.
There follows a desexing section on maxims (for ‚ÄúHe
who laughs last laughs best‚Äù read ‚ÄúThe last laugh is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">best‚Äù</ENAMEX>: not only does it not say the same thing but the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is totally lacking in the rhetorical devices
packed into the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>), and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-page bibliography,
reference notes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX>, and an index.  On the last
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">page</ENAMEX> is a short biographical note about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> in
which, through pronoun references, we learn that
both are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.

            
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nonsexist Word Finder , subtitled A Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gender-Free Usage</ENAMEX> , opens with a foreword by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swift</ENAMEX>.  Most of the book is an A-Z listing of
words that are, for the most part, sexist, but, as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> sets forth in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">User's Guide</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄúSome words are
included here because they are ambiguous: Is a belly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX> always a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>?  Is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> Mountie always
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>?‚Äù  Odd question, that; I had to phone the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> consulate to find out that there have been
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">female Mounties</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>, though one might question
their approval of being so designated.  As for belly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dancers</ENAMEX>, not only have I never heard of a male belly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX> but find the very idea more exotic than erotic.
Put on what, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>, they like to call a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúneed-to-know‚</ENAMEX>Äù
basis, then why not distinguish between
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">belly dancer</ENAMEX> and belly danseuse ?‚Äîthough I daresay
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosalie Maggio</ENAMEX>, would scarcely approve of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">danseuse</ENAMEX> .  Put another way, are not these very questions
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sexist</ENAMEX>?  In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sense they are, but if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were to
pay hard cash to watch a belly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX> only to find that
it was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, I think they might have some justification
in asking for their money back.  I would feel the
same way if I paid to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rockettes</ENAMEX> only find that
they were ‚ÄúRockets.‚Äù  There would probably be little
chance of a refund if the place were run by a feminist.

            Is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> attendant always a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>?  Any
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who has traveled in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> knows the answer to
be No.

            The entries themselves are more or less helpful,
depending on the information one is seeking.  The
treatment ranges from an explanation of a term to a
list of alternatives.  Here are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> typical entries:



according to Hoyle according to/by the book, according
to/playing by the rules, absolutely correct,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">cricket</ENAMEX>, in point of honor, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>,
proper/correct way to do things.  See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix A</ENAMEX>
for the rationale on avoiding sex-linked metaphors,
expressions and figures.

<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acolyte</ENAMEX> usage of this word varies from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time,
culture, and religion to another.  In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Church</ENAMEX>, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> can function
as acolytes (one of the minor orders of the diaconate)
but may not be officially installed as acolytes.
Insofar as it means ‚Äúattendant,‚Äù an acolyte can be
either a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.
            

            Reference to the designated section in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Appendix</ENAMEX> A
reveals a brief discussion of the subject of sex-linked
metaphors which quite correctly points out that many
common metaphors, metonyms, and allusions refer to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">males‚Äî Achilles</ENAMEX>' heel, before you can say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Robinson</ENAMEX>,
Bluebeard, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goliath</ENAMEX> , and many more.
(Why should one assume <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoyle</ENAMEX> to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>?)  Maggio
does not get bent out of shape about these, providing
the following advice:



There is nothing wrong with any of [these
images] in themselves.  However, their cumulative
effect tends to be overpowering.  This dictionary
lists alternatives for many of these expressions, not
so that they can be removed from the language,
but so that you can attempt to balance your writing
and speaking with both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX> and male
images or use alternatives when gender-fairness is
not possible.  In addition, there are times when it is
awkward and illogical to use a male metaphor for
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.  There is nothing ungrammatical or
wrong about saying ‚ÄúShe's a real <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny-comelately</ENAMEX>,‚Äù
but it grates.
            

            It is hard to imagine anyone, regardless of sex, enjoying
being referred to as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny</ENAMEX>-come-lately .  The
self-styled humorists could have a field day with this
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, too, suggesting ‚ÄúShe's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jacquelyn</ENAMEX> of all trades‚Äù or
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sexless</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Crusoe</ENAMEX> .  I looked up in the dictionary
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> a few of the allusions that cannot really be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paraphrased</ENAMEX>.  At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bluebeard</ENAMEX> , advice is given to avoid
reference to him completely, which is understandable
on nonlinguistic grounds, too.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Superman</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>)
is not in, nor is there an entry for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Quixote</ENAMEX> is listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX>, but I could not
find him in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>, nor could I find quixotic,
Queen of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheba, Jeeves</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einstein</ENAMEX> (for `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX>'),
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> (for `demagogue, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tryant</ENAMEX>'), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Attila the Hun</ENAMEX> (for
`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barbarian</ENAMEX>'), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson Crusoe</ENAMEX> (for `castaway; lonely
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>')‚Äîbut man <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> is in‚Äî <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horatio Alger</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Narcissus</ENAMEX> ,
etc.  But what are we to do about eponyms?

            Were the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washingtons</ENAMEX> (state and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>) named for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George or Martha</ENAMEX>?  Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> (mistakenly) think
that the slang term for a commode was named for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Crapper</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> plumber.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leotards</ENAMEX> and daguerreotypes
will have to go.

            For the most part, as might be expected, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maggio</ENAMEX>'s
alternatives and equivalents are phrasal definitions
which, if assiduously applied, would effectively sterilize
all writing.  The interesting and useful entries are
those in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> explains, without the frenetic
anguish that pervades the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M&S</ENAMEX> book, why the
term is offensive.  I cannot say that I agree with everything
she says nor with every item selected for inclusion,
but, on the whole, the book comes off as a very
good treatment of the subject.

            Such books are an education.  Were I in a position‚Äîsay
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of a newspaper‚Äîin which I was
responsible for treating the kinds of subjects that might
be construed as sensitive to antiwoman prejudice, I
should find <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">The Nonsexist Word Finder</ENAMEX> the sanest of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lot</ENAMEX> and the easiest to understand and use.  Compared
with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing</ENAMEX> , it
covers much more territory and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> are made to
feel that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> is cueing them in to the information
she thinks they ought to have.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Handbook</ENAMEX> is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polemical</ENAMEX> work; despite its title, it is not organized the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> a handbook for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>, etc., normally
would be.  It might have been more useful as a handbook
had it cleaved more closely to the structural
model of standard style manuals.  My greatest objection
to it is its argumentative, disputatious tone, which
frequently borders on the vituperative.  It is as if you
looked up, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infer</ENAMEX>/imply in a usage manual and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s treatment, in place of an explanation and
sound advice, were an unpleasant diatribe against anyone
so dense and rude as to have had to look up the
entry to begin with.  M&S are testy‚Äîwhich they may
have every right to be in light of the trials and tribulations
of women‚Äîbut their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">moody petulance</ENAMEX> does not
lead to a winning, let alone diplomatic style, and their
purpose is accordingly ill served.

            As for me, I do my utmost to avoid language that
may offend <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.  I refuse, out of
conservatism and sheer curmudgeonliness to give up
English grammar (like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúneutral‚Äù pronouns</ENAMEX> of reference)
when I cannot paraphrase without losing what
little elegance there may be in my writing, and I refuse
to sacrifice metonyms, metaphors, allusions, and
other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> of speech that contain male referents,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">substituting ‚Äúbig liar‚Äù</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Baron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Munchhausen</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúPeeping Thomasina‚</ENAMEX>Äù for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peeping Tom</ENAMEX> or trying to get
around saying or writing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pollyanna</ENAMEX>, say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX>, raise
Cain , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus Christ</ENAMEX> !

            How <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Big Is Your Dictionary</ENAMEX>?




            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> are not only literate,
but ‚Äúdictionarate.‚Äù  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, the dictionary's
‚Äúsuccess is shown by the fact that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 90 percent</NUMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> possess <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>, making the dictionary
far more popular than cookery books (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 70</NUMEX>
percent) and indeed significantly more widespread
than the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> (which was to be found in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society‚Äù</ENAMEX>).  In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄúIt was established some
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> that there are more dictionaries than television
sets ...‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preface</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Heritage Illustrated</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Encyclopedic Dictionary</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>).

            So you, dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>, probably own a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>.
But how big is it?  Let us consider <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionaries</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collins COBUILD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cobuild</ENAMEX> ) boasts xxiv plus
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1703</TIMEX> pages.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Collins English Dictionary of 1986</ENAMEX>
( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CED</ENAMEX> ) has xxvii plus <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1771</TIMEX>.  Looking at these figures, or
at the books themselves, one would assume that the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> are of roughly the same size.  And in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sense they are.  But <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between</NUMEX> water and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">watt</NUMEX> there
are fifty-four main entries in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cobuild</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">148</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CED</ENAMEX> .
They share such entries as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> biscuit and waterworks .
But in addition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CED</ENAMEX> alone enters water measurer
(a `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">bug'</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watford</ENAMEX> (a `<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>'),
etc.  On the other hand, the shared main entry for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">watershed</ENAMEX> has <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> words in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CED</ENAMEX> but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cobuild</ENAMEX> .  And the word waterless is a main entry
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cobuild</ENAMEX> , explained in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> words, whereas in
CED it is naught but a so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúundefined runon‚Äù‚</ENAMEX>Äîmerely
mentioned, but not explained explicitly,
as a sub-entry at <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> .  So <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CED</ENAMEX> enters more items
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">than Cobuild</ENAMEX> , but devotes less space to explaining
them.  And that is probably as it should be. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CED</ENAMEX> is
intended for the adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native speaker</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, whose
main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> is with understanding a large number of
unfamiliar items (including proper names) encountered
in reading and listening.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cobuild</ENAMEX> is intended for
the foreign learner of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, whose dual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> is
with understanding and using the core vocabulary of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, and who, having achieved that aim, can
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúgraduate‚Äù</ENAMEX> to a dictionary for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native speakers‚</ENAMEX>Äîlike
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CED</ENAMEX> .

            More generally, the size of a dictionary is a function
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> variables: the number of items entered (its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äúmacrostructure‚Äù</ENAMEX>), and the amount of information
given about them (its <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúmicrostructure‚Äù</ENAMEX>).  In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGregor</ENAMEX>'s words, a dictionary that says ‚Äúa lot about a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">little‚Äù</ENAMEX> and one that says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúa</ENAMEX> little about a lot‚Äù can end
up roughly the same size.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cobuild</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CED</ENAMEX> are far
from being such polar opposites, but they exemplify
this general point.

            In measuring dictionaries, how far can we rely on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX>' own estimates of their size?  Let us
consider the dust-jacket blurbs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cobuild</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CED</ENAMEX> , and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native-speaker</ENAMEX> dictionaries: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Longman Dictionary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman</ENAMEX> ,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ninth New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collegiate Dictionary</ENAMEX> ( <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W9 , 1983</TIMEX>).  Here is what they
say :



Cobuild:   <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 70,000</NUMEX> references
CED:       170,000 references
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman</ENAMEX>:   Over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">225,000</NUMEX> definitions and
                        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 90,000</NUMEX> headwords
W9:        Almost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160,000</NUMEX> entries and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200,000</NUMEX>
                        definitions


            

            Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W9</TIMEX> estimate their macrostructure
( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">headwords/entries</ENAMEX> ) and their microstructure ( definitions ).
But what of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cobuild</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CED</ENAMEX> ?  What do they
mean by references ?  In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CED</ENAMEX> the relevant definition of
reference seems to be ‚Äúa book or passage referred to,‚Äù or
perhaps ‚Äúa mention or allusion‚Äù; in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cobuild</ENAMEX> , ‚Äúsomething
such as a number or name that tells you where
you can obtain the information that you want, for example
from a book, list, or map....‚Äù  We are none the
wiser.  It is only from an article about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CED</ENAMEX> that we
learn it has ‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Äú171,000</NUMEX> entries,‚Äù which suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX>
means by references what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merriam-Webster</ENAMEX> means by
entries .  But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CED</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cobuild</ENAMEX> certainly do not say so!

            And what about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman</ENAMEX>'s headwords ?  Their
relevant definition of headword is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúa</ENAMEX> word or term
placed at the beginning (e.g. of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> or an entry
in a dictionary).‚Äù  Does that mean that the number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">headwords</ENAMEX> equals the number of entries?  And that
therefore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman</ENAMEX>'s macrostructure (number of entries )
is much smaller than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">W9</ENAMEX> or CED ?  We
need to look more closely at the meaning of entry .

            For entry our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> have this to say in
their relevant definitions:



Cobuild: a short article about someone or something
in a dictionary or encyclopedia,...

CED: an item recorded, as in a diary, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>,
or account.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman</ENAMEX>: a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dictionary headword</ENAMEX> [!], often together
with its definition.

W9: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äú4b</ENAMEX> ... (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>): <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEADWORD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>): a headword
with its definition or identification (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>): VOCABULARY
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ENTRY‚</ENAMEX>Äù
            

            
               W9's relevant definition of headword does not
even mention dictionaries: <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúa</ENAMEX> word or term placed at
the beginning (as of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> or an entry in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">encyclopedia)‚Äù</ENAMEX>.
But its definition of vocabulary entry is
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> dictionaries only:



a word (as the noun book), hyphened or open compound
(as the verb book-match or the noun book
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX>), word element (as the affix pro-), abbreviation
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as agt</NUMEX>), verbalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> (as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Na</ENAMEX>), or term
(as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>) entered alphabetically in a
dictionary for the purpose of definition or identification
or expressly included as an inflected form
(as the noun <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> or the verb saw) or as a derived
form (as the noun godlessness or the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adverb</ENAMEX> globally)
or related phrase (as one for the book) run on
at its base word and usu. set in a type (as boldface)
readily distinguishable from that of the lightface
running text which defines, explains, or identifies
the entry
            

            If we can sort out all the details here‚Äîno mean
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">task‚Äîit</ENAMEX> emerges that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W9</TIMEX> 's vocabulary entries include
both what I earlier called main entries (like watershed )
and what I called subentries (like waterless in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CED</ENAMEX> ).  But it appears that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman</ENAMEX>'s headwords are
only those that are, or introduce, main entries.  So we
still have no way of knowing whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman</ENAMEX>'s macrostructure
is smaller or larger than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W9</TIMEX> 's!  Nor do our
troubles end here.  For in its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explanatory Notes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p.12</ENAMEX>),
W9 not only calls our attention ‚Äúto the definition of
vocabulary entry in this book,‚Äù but also introduces us
to a wholly new notion, that of dictionary entry :



The term dictionary entry includes all vocabulary
entries as well as all boldface entries in the separate
sections of the back matter headed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúAbbreviations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Symbols for Chemical</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Elements</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äù ‚ÄúForeign Words and Phrases</ENAMEX>,‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúBiographical Names,‚Äù ‚ÄúGeographical Names,‚Äù</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúColleges and Universities</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
            

            No sooner have we assumed that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W9</TIMEX>'s macrostructure
of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚ÄúAlmost 160,000 entries‚</NUMEX>Äù means vocabulary entries ,
than we must face the possibility that it includes
such other dictionary entries as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard U.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McGill</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U .</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abilene Christian U</ENAMEX> .  Have they been counted
in?  We simply do not know.  But, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX>
might say, we should be told.  For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W9</TIMEX>'s exemplary precision
in telling us what vocabulary entries and dictionary
entries are is offset by its vagueness about
which type of entry its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-wallahs</ENAMEX> have counted for
their blurb.

            Furthermore, our gratitude to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman</ENAMEX> and W9
for saying something about the size of their microstructures
is offset by our sorrowful recognition of how
little they say.  Counting definitions is a start.  But a
definition can range from a single-word synonym ( entry
4b(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEADWORD</ENAMEX>) to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">117</NUMEX> words of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W9</TIMEX>'s definition
of vocabulary entry ‚Äîand beyond!  And the microstructure
of dictionaries includes more than just
definitions: it can embrace examples, illustrations,
synonym essays, usage essays, etymologies, and all
sorts of other information.  Everyone talks nowadays
about making <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dictionaries</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>-friendlier.  How about
making their publicity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX>-friendlier as well?

            
               Aux armes, citoyens !  Let us strive to get dictionary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publishers</ENAMEX> to cry their wares in ways that allow us to
compare them.  But, citoyens , let us not forget that the
value of a dictionary resideth not in size alone.  The
best dictionary for me is the one that gives about the
word or phrase that puzzles me the information I need
at the moment I need it.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> have different reference
needs at different times.  The standardization of
the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> estimate how much they contain
need not, and should not, entail the standardization of
what they contain.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fifth Estate</ENAMEX>



            It began in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">medieval Europe</ENAMEX>, and in the late 20th
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> it is everywhere in the world.  Its overall
influence is profound but undiscussed, although aspects
of that influence are discussed constantly, under
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">headings</ENAMEX> like ‚Äúlanguage,<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äù ‚Äúeducation,‚Äù ‚Äústandards,‚Äù</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúliteracy,‚Äù ‚Äúliterature,‚Äù ‚Äúscience,‚Äù</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúmedicine</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
There is little that it does not touch, being physically
present in the architecture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, psychologically
present when we talk and think about what makes us
civilized, linguistically present in much of modern
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> and in what we call educated usage.
Yet is has no name.

            Let me therefore give it a name: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúthe scholarly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guild</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  The phrase is a reminder of its medieval provenance,
its academic focus, and its corporate style.  This
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guild</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> is one of the most successful enterprises
in the history of our species.  Indeed, some of its
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> gave our species the elevated
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX> , as if thinking of themselves while
labeling all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bugs</ENAMEX> in creation.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guild</ENAMEX> takes many forms now, but it retains much
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</TIMEX>, of the ecclesiastical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schoolmen</ENAMEX>,
who gathered together in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">quasi-monastic ‚Äúcolleges</ENAMEX>,‚Äù
behind walls that marked them off from the rest of the
world (a phenomenon that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> is still called
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äútown</ENAMEX> and gown‚Äù).

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> (and increasingly the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>) who have
inherited the mantle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schoolmen</ENAMEX> have no trouble
recognizing each other.  They live similar lives, conduct
similar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, and with similar subventions go to
similar conferences and give similar papers on every
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">continent</ENAMEX> (much as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Lodge</ENAMEX> describes them in
Small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World</ENAMEX> ).  They are not as tightly knit as other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fraternities</ENAMEX>, past and present (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knights Templar</ENAMEX>,
Freemasons, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jesuits</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mafia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancient</ENAMEX> and Mystical Order
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosy Cross</ENAMEX>, corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX>
or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> of labor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>).  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guild</ENAMEX>'s gentler cohesion and lack of obvious international
hierarchies have contributed to its marked success
and curious anonymity.  Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> take many
forms and survive under many different political
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regimes</ENAMEX>.  They possess neither a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican</ENAMEX> nor a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vicar-General</ENAMEX>
to report to, and, although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guild</ENAMEX> can at
times be arcane (with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">charters</ENAMEX> and capping
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ceremonies</ENAMEX>), by and large its doings are overt and benign.

            Historically, the bulk of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> has never
known a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX>, let alone a cloister or an ivory
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tower</ENAMEX>, or met up with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> empowered by letters
after their names.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nowadays</ENAMEX>, however, there are few
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have not come across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> and college
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX> or (at the periphery of things) been invited
to learn to read and write.  That is a physical and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> measure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guild</ENAMEX>'s success.  Its continuance
seems assured.  Working in its favor is a social contract
with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-part system established in every country
in the world:



Bottom-up progression: the young being inducted
into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> at an early age and proceeding,
level by level, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> of ever ‚Äúhigher‚Äù learning,
stopping off for various reasons at various
levels, usually marked by tests and the distribution
of certificates providing a social grade.  These processes
are often reinforced with such comments
from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> as, ‚ÄúYou'll never get anywhere
nowadays without a college education.‚Äù
There are even league tables among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>, showing
the percentages of those who stay in the system
longer.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Top-down</ENAMEX> rank: an apex of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>
buttressed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> of college degrees
(many of them lower-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> within the system).  These are in
turn surrounded and supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> of
school certificates and other qualifications.  Spreading
out from the base of the pyramid are those
who have less suitably certified educations or no
formal education at all, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who may have
mixed feelings about ‚Äúbook learning,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù ‚Äúbig</ENAMEX> words,‚Äù
‚Äúfancy degrees,<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äù ‚Äúeggheads,‚Äù ‚Äúhighbrows,‚Äù</ENAMEX> and ‚Äúabsent-minded
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX>,‚Äù as well as the perils of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scholarship</ENAMEX>, science, and technology.  Within the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, there are others with similar mixed feelings,
but by and large the system remains intact.
We all send our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>.

Language appropriate to level: a basic ability to
read and write, followed by the capacity to handle
abstract usage, and, at a higher level, to be at ease
with what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Gove</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s Third called
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISV</ENAMEX>, `international scientific vocabulary.'  For <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>,
this means a capacity to add the Latinate
onto the vernacular, then <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latinate</ENAMEX>,
so that you can eat a hearty breakfast, and be cordial
afterwards without suffering from cardiac arrest.
Beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, entry into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guild</ENAMEX> may
mean acquiring a special language of education
(such as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Senegal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>),
because many of the world's tongues are not yet
(and may not ever be) part of the circle of standardized
print languages in which the work of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guild</ENAMEX> can be conducted.
            

            You and I, gentle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>, are accredited members
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guild</ENAMEX>.  This is demonstrated in a variety of ways:
a shared literacy and the assumptions and biases that
go with it; an awareness of what books are for; consciousness
and use of innumerable cultural allusions
and educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idioms</ENAMEX>; and a relative ease in reading a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">periodical</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>, with sections called OBITER
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DICTA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPISTOLAE</ENAMEX>.  We are generally capable of
conducting ourselves in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> of others who
have been group-educated to college level.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, college, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have for
some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six centuries</TIMEX> been receiving diplomas and titles to
prove that, in varying degrees (a loaded word), they
are educated.  Oftener than not, use of language establishes
membership and social-cum-educational rank as
clearly as any parchment.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the less pleasant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> in which such rank can be pulled is to label the
linguistically less secure ‚Äúilliterate.‚Äù  They, too, can
read and write, of course, but their ‚Äúsolecisms,<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äù ‚Äúbarbarisms,‚Äù</ENAMEX>
and ‚Äúvulgarisms‚Äù call for rebuke, and what
better rebuke than to treat them as if they did not
belong at all‚Äîto condemn them figuratively to the
outer darkness of the unlettered?  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subtler</ENAMEX> still is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">label ‚Äúself-educated‚</ENAMEX>Äù applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have little
formal learning.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Hardy</ENAMEX> described an extreme
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">case in Jude the Obscure</ENAMEX> .

            The scholarly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guild</ENAMEX> has always interested itself in
language, its standards and usage, its literature and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classics</ENAMEX>, its mediums/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> of manuscript and print,
its academic apparatus and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> tags.  It places a high
value on success with such things.  Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have
tended to place a lower value on rural and urban dialect,
popular culture, and folklore.  These are only accepted
into the canon of good usage and literature
after a long and vigorous rearguard action.  Only now,
for example, is the soap opera (with its enormous social
impact) beginning to be recognized as a fit topic
for academic analysis.  Movies and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soaps</ENAMEX> attain respectability
when there are enough papers in learned journals
and theses in bound volumes to elevate them beyond
being ‚Äúmerely‚Äù popular.  It is similar with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> low on the ladder of rank.  Once upon a time
there was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playwright</ENAMEX> who knew little <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> and less
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>.  Much of his skill was acquired in the hurly-burly
of life, but his works had a certain merit.  With
the passage of time he was canonized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guild</ENAMEX>, and
his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Complete Works</ENAMEX> have been annotated and organized
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> with doctorates in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shakespearian Studies</ENAMEX>.
He made it to the top.  It can be done, but it is rare.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guild</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> have, in their unobtrusively
ubiquitous way, become more powerful than
both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> Christianity which gave them birth
and the regimes of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> that scattered them round
the world.  Their diaspora has been so successful that
most of us unreflectingly see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> as the natural
dispensers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX>, instruments, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> of
education‚Äîand of educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">discourse‚</ENAMEX>Äîeverywhere
on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>.  It is another measure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guild</ENAMEX>'s success
that we can hardly imagine an alternative to it.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">utopian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">communes</ENAMEX> of anarchists, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">socialists</ENAMEX>, and hippies,
for example, have not even dented it.

            After centuries of social and cultural direction
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guild</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> (the professorial elite, the academic,
scientific, and medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishments</ENAMEX>), it is
hardly possible for anyone in the Western or Westernizing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">world</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> to be reckoned (or to feel) educated
without having been to school‚Äîand the more school
the better.  It may be possible to imagine alternatives
(or significant adaptations, if we wish them) only after
we have found the right label for the subject.  Societies
seldom see what is central in their own cultures, having
much less trouble identifying it in the cultures of
others.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Historians</ENAMEX> have often discussed the ‚Äúthree estates‚Äù
of the Western world‚Äînobility, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, and commons.
Many of us also from time to time talk about a
‚Äúfourth estate‚Äù‚Äîthe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>.  The idea of social estates
can be taken <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> stage further, to the global agglomeration
of educational and scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>.  They
constitute a ‚Äúfifth estate,‚Äù an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> as worthy of anthropological
investigation as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yanomama</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dinka</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>.  Unfortunately, just
as we find it hard to imagine the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guild</ENAMEX> as a whole and
to envisage alternatives to it, so no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> exists
outside this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> estate that could investigate it.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Anthropology</ENAMEX>
is one of its own more recent subdivisions.
So who might assess these diplomaed assessors?

            There appears to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> solution.  A traditional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aim</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guild</ENAMEX> is the quest for truth.  If that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aim</ENAMEX> is sincere (and, by and large, it seems to be), the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> estate may yet turn the bright light of science and
scholarship on itself.  That would be an interesting day.
         
         
            Texican





            <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is a mongrel tongue.  It is basically composed
of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29 percent</NUMEX> Anglo-Saxon and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 percent</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romance</ENAMEX> (including <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>) words.  The remaining
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> are either invented ( laser, bogus,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splurge</ENAMEX> ) or have been borrowed from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 200</NUMEX>
other languages or dialects from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Zulu</ENAMEX>.  No
other national language even comes close to that.  One
reason for this diversity is the custom of English-speaking
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">explorers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneers</ENAMEX> in a new land to adopt the
native name for unfamiliar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, and
things.  Other cultures do not follow this custom.
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> first saw a huge animal in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>,
they called it hippopotamus , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> word for `water
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>.'  When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boers</ENAMEX> first saw a strange animal in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>, they called it aardvark , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> word
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">`earth pig</ENAMEX>.'  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, however, seeing a large
bearlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, adopted the Nepalese
name panda ; and a strange water mammal was given
its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Javanese</ENAMEX> name dugong .

            When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> speaking different languages
share a common border, there is an infiltration of
words from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> language to the other.  The north border
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> is with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, most of whose
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> share our common <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> speech.  True, the
official language of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quebec</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>;
and true, we have borrowed a few words from there;
lacrosse , for example.  But the south border is another
matter.  For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 160 years</TIMEX>, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anglos</ENAMEX> arrived
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, there has been a culture transfer back
and forth across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rio Grande</ENAMEX>.  The process is still
going on.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifteen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonio</ENAMEX> had heard of burritos, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fajitas</ENAMEX>, flautas , or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chalupas</ENAMEX> .  Today, thanks to franchise <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>,
they have become a part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s vocabulary.
Other food names that have passed through the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipeline</ENAMEX> into common usage are chile, enchilada,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taco</ENAMEX>, tamale, tortilla, fr√≠jol, frito, picante,
jalape√±o, nacho, mescal, tequila , and margarita .  It
may be interesting to note the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> borrowed chile,
tamale, mescal , and mesquite from the indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>
before passing them on to us.

            Let us now pass on to the names of some clothing
items that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texans</ENAMEX> borrowed and then passed on to the
rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>: sombrero, mantilla, poncho, rebozo,
serape , and huarache .  A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> followed the same route: avocado from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aguacate</ENAMEX>; mesquite; sapodilla from zapote; guayule;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">coyote</ENAMEX>; armadillo; ocelot from ocelote; chaparral ; and
javalina from jabalina .  Since cattle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ranching</ENAMEX> is common
to both sides of the border, it should come as no
surprise that there has been an exchange of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch</ENAMEX>-related
words: lariat from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la reata</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">bronco</ENAMEX>; lasso from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lazo</ENAMEX>; rodeo; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chaps</ENAMEX> from chaparreras; charro; hackamore
from j√°quima; mustang from mestengo ; and
quirt from cuerda or cuarta .

            Finally, there is a miscellaneous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of words.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alamo</ENAMEX> , the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> defeat by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Ana</ENAMEX>;
hoosegow from juzgado `<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>'; dinero `money,' a
Spanish corruption of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> denarius; macho ,
from the same root as machete : he who wields a machete
must be skillful and powerful, hence the word
has come to mean `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">virile</ENAMEX>' and its associated noun, machismo ,
`virility.'  A gringo , from griego `<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>,' is one
whose speech ‚Äúsounds like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> to me.‚Äù  The story that
it comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">song ‚ÄúGreen Grow the Lilacs</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> said
to have been sung at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jacinto</ENAMEX>, is an example of folk
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etymology</ENAMEX>.  Let us not forget marijuana which is simply
`<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Jane</ENAMEX>' in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, or cucaracha , the `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cockroach</ENAMEX>'
that entered <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> via a popular song.

            Some time ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texans</ENAMEX> picked up a speech habit
that is being acquired by the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.  When
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texans</ENAMEX>, in particular <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South Texans</ENAMEX>, want to emphasize
a statement, they often use a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> word.  If they
want to be emphatic about a large undertaking, they
might say, ‚ÄúI'm going to do it all!  The entire thing!  The
whole enchilada! ‚Äù  About someone who is in complete
charge of a project, they could say, ‚ÄúHe runs things
completely!  He's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>!  <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">N√∫mero uno</ENAMEX>! ‚Äù  Then there is
negation: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúI</ENAMEX> had nothing to do with that!  Nothing at
all!  Nada! <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  And</ENAMEX> to request confirmation, they might
well say ‚ÄúYou do it exactly this way!  You'd better do it
right!  Comprende ?‚Äù

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> has contributed a few good words to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English language</ENAMEX> without any help from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>.  During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1850s</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> acquired a
small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">herd</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Matagorda Island</ENAMEX>.  Because he
knew little about the cattle business and cared less, he
never got around to branding his stock.  That <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Maverick</ENAMEX>.  As time passed, cattlemen began
calling all unbranded <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle mavericks</ENAMEX> .  The word
spread throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> and into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> generally.
And its meaning expanded to mean any nonconformist.
Then there are the cattalo and the beefalo , crosses
between cattle and buffalo, first attempted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>.  A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jackalope</ENAMEX> is an imaginary horned rabbit, reputedly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhabiting</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">West Texas</ENAMEX>.

            These fifty words that have entered <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> after a
brief sojourn in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> can be found in almost any dictionary.
That is to say, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one</NUMEX> of every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words came into the language via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas</ENAMEX>.  If the
average <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> uses from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three to five thousand</NUMEX>
different words <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>, the chances are everybody in
this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> will use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texican</ENAMEX> words.
         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hidden Compounds</ENAMEX>






            The compounding process is a simple, economical
system of word formation is modern <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
Compounding native <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> words or elements produces
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX> classes of combinations‚Äînoun: <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farmhouse</ENAMEX> ;
verb: understand ; adjective: <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ; adverb: herewith ;
preposition: into ; pronoun: someone ; conjunction:
because ; interjection: good grief .  It is also a
gradual process, as evidenced by the sequence of to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">day</ENAMEX>, to-day, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> .

            Of much more interest, however, are the common
words used in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> that were once compounds but
are not easily recognized as such <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.  Let us reveal
their dual disposition:

            
               Alone , in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle English</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al</ENAMEX> `all' + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> `one'.  If
one is by himself, he, she, or it is alone.  The word is
generally associated with being lonely.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atom</ENAMEX> is from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> a- `not' + temnein `cut.'
The atom was named before it was split.  Around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B.C.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Democritus</ENAMEX> theorized that a thing could be divided
and divided until it became so small it could no
longer be divided.  The theory was largely shelved for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two thousand years</TIMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several physicists</TIMEX> produced
theories which led to the fact that the atom could be
split.  Because of this, atom is a misnomer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.

            
               Atone comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle English</ENAMEX> at `at' + on
`<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.'  The term is used largely in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> sense of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> dying to atone for the sins of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>; his death
reconciled, ‚Äúmade one,‚Äù God and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barn</ENAMEX> is compounded from the Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words
beren `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">barley</ENAMEX>' + ern `<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>.'  The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barn</ENAMEX> was the building
for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">storing barley</ENAMEX>.  Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Saxon</ENAMEX> times, the word
has gone through a process of generalization, whereby
it has taken on a wider range of meaning.

            
               Chair is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> compound of kata `down' +
hedra `sit, seat.'  An appropriate name it is for the
object in which we sit ourselves down to rest.

            
               Copy is a blend of the prefix, co `with' + <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
opia `abundance.'  Before the invention of the printing
press, manuscripts had to be copied by hand.  Since a
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> copy exceeded the first by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred</NUMEX> percent,
it was considered an abundance.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daisy</ENAMEX> is a combination of the Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">d√¶ges</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">day's' + ƒìage</ENAMEX> `eye.'  Perhaps it was so called
because it opens in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> and closes at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, or
because of its eyelike shape.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denim</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX>.  In the older <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> produced serge, a material for
making clothing.  Of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">serge de N√Æmes</ENAMEX>
was the finest.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denim</ENAMEX> is from de `from' + <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N√Æmes</ENAMEX> , the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dozen</ENAMEX> is a mathematically compounded word
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> duo `<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>' + decem `<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>.'  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
equals twelve in any language.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enemy</ENAMEX> is a combination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> in `not' +
amicus `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>,' and is thus a doublet with inimical .
That <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> could be related to amiable , is more than
a little ironic.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garlic</ENAMEX> is compounded from the Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> gar
`<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">spear</ENAMEX>,' and l√™ac `leek.'  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garlic</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the family
of leeks which is related to the onion.  Its blades are its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äúspears.</ENAMEX>‚Äù

            The Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> hlƒÅf , `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loaf</ENAMEX>' + dige or diƒ´ge , variants
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">d√¶ge `kneader</ENAMEX>,' combine to make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> .  Apparently,
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> kneaders of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lariat</ENAMEX> is compounded from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> la `the' +
reata `lasso.'  Even though lariat contains its own <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX>, when we imported it into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, we
added another, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English the</ENAMEX> , to create a literal the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">la</ENAMEX> reata , `the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the lasso</TIMEX>,' and we never think of it as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redundancy</ENAMEX>.

            
               None is the combined Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> ne `not' + ƒÅn
`<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.'

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obese</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> words, the
prefix, ob - `over' <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">+ ƒìdere `</ENAMEX>eat.'  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overating</ENAMEX> is a prerequisite
for becoming obese.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">≈ç `the letter ‚Äúo‚Äù</ENAMEX> '+ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">m√</NUMEX>™ga
`large, great,' combine to make omega .  It contrasts
with ≈ç + micron `small' which form omicron , the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúsmaller‚Äù o</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> alphabet.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stirrup</ENAMEX> has been compounded from the Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
stige `ascent' + rƒÅp .'  Anglo-Saxon stirrups
were made of rope and were probably used for ascending
objects other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>.

            
               Windows is compounded from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Icelandic</ENAMEX> words
vindr `wind' + auga `eye,' a window being the eye of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">house.</ENAMEX>

            Because they are short‚Äîsome reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX>
syllable‚Äîsuch words are not immediately apparent as
compounds, and their true nature is exposed only by
word archaeology.
         
         

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Bauerls</ENAMEX> writes interestingly about the recent
proliferation of ‚Äúone-letter words‚Äù [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>].
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> hopes he will continue his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> chronicle.

            Although he didn't draw the conclusion explicitly,
real life and his examples, make it clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OLWs</ENAMEX> are
used mainly as surrogates for romance and (where
there's a difference that matters) sex.  For example, in
the OLW lexicon, when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> people‚Äîsometimes but
not always a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and a woman‚Äîagree that they Lword
one another, they often enter into one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cwords</ENAMEX> ,
which leads perhaps eventually to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>-word ,
which in turn authorizes them to F-word with the
sanction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and state....

            But the implication that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OLWs</ENAMEX> are new‚Äîjust because
they now appear routinely in comic strips and on
television‚Äîis misguided.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thirty-one years ago</TIMEX>, in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">song for The Music Man called ‚ÄúThe Sadder-But-Wiser</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Girl,‚Äù Meredith Willson</ENAMEX> wrote the lyric: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúI hope and I
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pray/For Hester</ENAMEX> to win <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> more `<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX>' ‚Äù  We knew
exactly what it meant.  In fact, I bet they even knew
what it meant in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1850</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Scarlet Letter</ENAMEX> hit the
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>.




         
         
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell Bodenheim</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harlem</ENAMEX> Slang




            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell Bodenheim</ENAMEX> is no longer the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s pajamas.
If he was once something of a cult figure
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> and, later, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenwich</ENAMEX>
Village, he is no longer of much interest to any
reader‚Äîexcept perhaps to some stray dissertation student
or to some crime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> dredging up the gruesome
details surrounding his violent death.  So much
for the vicissitudes of poetic fame.

            Back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1931</TIMEX>, however, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bodenheim</ENAMEX> was coming
into his own as a literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maverick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> publisher
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horace Liveright</ENAMEX> issued his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">novel‚Äî Naked</ENAMEX> on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roller Skates</ENAMEX> .  The title is a grabber, but the book itself
would be anathema to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> since it features a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX> who wishes to be beaten and degraded:



<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúListen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terry‚</ENAMEX>Äîany <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> can beat up a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'s
body.  That's no trick.  I want an A number one,
guaranteed bastard.  I want him to beat my heart
and beat my brain.  I want him to hurt me so I'll
get wise.  I want him to lug me everywhere.  All the
lowest dives, the phoniest ginmills ... I want him
to throw me up against everybody‚Äîthe crummiest
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">woodchucks</ENAMEX>... the worst fourflushers... everybody.
I want to meet the coldest women‚Äîthe
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who get their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and then
start to bawl about how sad and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unlucky</ENAMEX> they've
been... I want to run into everybody just once
...They say a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> can't do it.  They say she runs
into a smashup every time.  Well, believe me, she'll
smash up in a village cupboard too, if she can't
hide herself and settle down.  That's a lot of newspaper

            Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bodenheim</ENAMEX>'s novel might be of interest to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language because of its use of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slang</ENAMEX>.  Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bodenheim</ENAMEX> appends to his book a short
glossary of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harlem</ENAMEX> words used in the course of the
novel.  I take the liberty of reprinting the glossary here,
because some of the terms are far from common
( chippy, hootch , and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> are perhaps the more
familiar) and many are not included in standard dictionaries
of slang:

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bodenheim</ENAMEX> adds a note: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúMost of the above-listed
terms are peculiar to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harlem</ENAMEX>, but some of them are
also used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> in other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only a third</NUMEX> of
the terms have found their way into <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Dictionary of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Slang</ENAMEX> , compiled and edited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wentworth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart Berg Flexner</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Y. Crowell</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Chapman</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New Dictionary of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Slang</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harper</ENAMEX> & Row, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>).  Also Went-worth/Flexner
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapman</ENAMEX> both cite the term the
leather as meaning a kick, but they date the term from
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1946</TIMEX>, citing a passage from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Damon Runyon</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúhe</ENAMEX>
would give his fallen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foe</ENAMEX> what we called `the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather</ENAMEX>,'
meaning a few boots abaft the ears...and spareribs.‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bodenheim</ENAMEX>'s glossary indicates the term was
popular long before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1946</TIMEX>.

            As for hamburger down , meaning to `take it easy,'
could there be any relationship between that term and
the hamburger cited by both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapman</ENAMEX> and Went-worth/Flexner?
Hamburger means a `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prize-fighter</ENAMEX> who
is badly beaten' or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">`bum'‚</ENAMEX>Äîboth <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who are
‚Äútaking it easy.‚Äù  Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bodenheim</ENAMEX>'s list might be a
source of enlightenment and delight to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slang</ENAMEX> and is commended to their attention.
         
         
            Of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Course</ENAMEX>, Cuthbert




            Recently I found in one of those files in which for
many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> I have been systematically losing
things a magazine clipping from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years ago</TIMEX>
which points out that the formal language of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX>
and more past can lead to misunderstandings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.  It
offers a case in point from one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> volumes of The
Lives of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saints</TIMEX> , a massive work written between
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1872 and 1889</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabine Baring-Gould</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1834-1924</TIMEX>),
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergyman</ENAMEX> who is best remembered as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of the hymn, ‚ÄúOnward, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Soldiers</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
Here is what he had to say about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Cuthbert</ENAMEX>, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monk</ENAMEX> who became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bishop</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lindisfarne</ENAMEX> and
who died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 687</TIMEX>:



No saint of his time or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> had more frequent
or affectionate intercourse than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuthbert</ENAMEX> with the
nuns, whose numbers and influence were daily increasing
among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-saxons</ENAMEX>, and especially in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northumberland</ENAMEX>.
            

            I wasn't quite sure about the clipping, so I checked the
work itself in our public library‚Äîand that's what it
gives.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bearing-Gould</ENAMEX>, a compulsive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, was a man
of Victorian delicacy.  In one of his novels he mentioned
‚Äúcertain heavily-frilled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cotton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investitures</ENAMEX> of the lower
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">limbs‚Äù</ENAMEX> and elsewhere referred to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúthe bloomer arrangement
in the nether latitude.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>)

            Anyway, this sent me to the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> , where I
found about a column-and-a-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> on intercourse .  As a
noun it was first used of trade dealings between people
of different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">localities</ENAMEX>.  Originally spelt entercourse , it
comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> entrecours `commerce,' which
is from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> intercursus (also `commerce').

            Soon it came to denote `communion between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>'
and `that which is spiritual or unseen.'  (I vaguely
remember a hymn I heard, and perhaps helped sing,
that contains the phrase <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúintercourse divine</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>)

            As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early as 1806</TIMEX> the word was used with apparent
sexual signification by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Malthus</ENAMEX>, the parson
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> who is remembered for his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Essay</ENAMEX> on the
Principle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Population</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúAn illicit intercourse between
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sexes</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  But that use apparently was rare in those
times.  I do not know when the word, standing alone,
came into common use with an explicit sexual sense.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX> the word was also a verb: `to run
through, run across.  To have intercourse with .'

            Now back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Cuthbert the saint</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivor Brown</ENAMEX>, in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of his delightful books on words, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random Words</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX>), writes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuthbert</ENAMEX> had been an honored
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX> name, but that somehow during the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1914‚Äî18</NUMEX>
war it ‚Äúceased to be a name and became an insult‚Äù and
was used of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slackers</ENAMEX> who evaded military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> does not know how that happened.  This use of
the name as a derogatory noun is given in both the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Supplements</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> and in the recent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> were named for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuthbert</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kirkcudbright</ENAMEX> (`<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of Cuthbert'</ENAMEX>), the name
of a small former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> and its main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, is
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pronounced ‚Äúkir-KOO-bree‚Äù‚</ENAMEX>Äîwhich <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> reports is
said by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX> with a ‚Äúdove-like murmur.‚Äù
         
         


            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Re Dan Cragg</ENAMEX>'s letter [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>], he should note that
while there are many different views on ‚Äúthe point of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam war</ENAMEX>,‚Äù those military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> other than
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> operating <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> ‚Äúout of our
former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base complex</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cam Ranh Bay‚</ENAMEX>Äù are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soviet</ENAMEX>
rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>.  In particular, it is interesting to
wonder what percentage actually are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>, that is,
from the state/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">S.S.R.</ENAMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soviet</ENAMEX>
government has the problem of balancing the widely
diverse needs and values of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">republics</ENAMEX> within a military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureaucracy</ENAMEX>.  It is my
(wholly unsubstantiated) guess that the majority of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> are in fact not <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>.

me of the license plate a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> reported recently.

            CORRIGENDA

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúscribal‚Äù</ENAMEX> error was responsible for printing
hidari-leiki for hidari-kiki in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robin Gill</ENAMEX>'s epistola
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>].

            In response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Lederer</ENAMEX>'s ‚ÄúGunning for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Language‚</ENAMEX>Äù [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>], Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Kluth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX>,
points out that the difference between the coefficients
of expansion of iron and brass‚Äîa mere 1/64th
inch‚Äîwould be insufficient to cause the (cannon) balls
to be dislodged from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">brass ‚Äúmonkey‚Äù</ENAMEX> and survive as a
justification for the origin of cold enough to freeze the
balls off a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">brass monkey</ENAMEX> .

            Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas B. Lemann</ENAMEX> points out that the transliteration
of the opening quotation of ‚ÄúOnomatoplazia‚Äù
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>] contains the following errors:



<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Œ∫ŒªŒ±ŒΩŒΩŒ∑</ENAMEX> should be klange, not klagge
geneto argureolou bioiou should be
genet'argureoio bioio.
            

            And, where the reference is made in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> paragraph
to ‚Äúthe twanging release of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ulysses</ENAMEX>' silver bow,‚Äù
that the bowman is not Ulysses but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX>, shooting
into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>.
         
         

            Aficionados of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duende</ENAMEX> who enjoyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bria</ENAMEX>'s
exegesis, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">(‚ÄúDuende: Gypsy Soul and Something More‚</ENAMEX>Äù
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>], of its ‚Äúmagical quality,‚Äù should refer to the
works of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Frazier</ENAMEX>, another of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champions</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frazier</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1911-1974</TIMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX>,
sometime entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX> magazine, and
general journalistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> and gadfly, was enamored of
the word, which he <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> found in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Tynan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holiday</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles Davis</ENAMEX>:



<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duende</ENAMEX> is very difficult to define.  Yet when it is
there it is unmistakable, inspiring our awe, quickening
our memory‚Äî...to observe someone or
something that has it is to feel icy fingers running
down our spine.
            

            My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> for the preceding is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Fountain</ENAMEX>'s engaging
biography of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frazier</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Another Man's Poison</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe Pequot Press</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>.



         
         

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duende</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>] may be absent in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bria</ENAMEX> assures us, but it is alive and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prospering</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX>.  It has the original meaning,
a `sprite or hobgoblin that plays tricks, especially at
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>; a poltergeist.'

            There is a term in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> player
reaching a height, for a brief stretch or longer, when
he cannot miss, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> call it zoning .  I have
not heard it used in other cases, but when used it
seems to equal tener duende .  I do not know whether
that use of duende has reached <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, but if it has not, it probably will
soon, because so many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> are bilingual
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>.




         
         

            In his delightful article, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúOnomatoplazia‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>],
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chester Delaney</ENAMEX> writes, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äú analysand</ENAMEX> ... was obviously
derived directly from the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">- nd marker</NUMEX> of the
active gerund in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>, which suggests the therapist
(active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>) rather than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>....‚Äù

            Not so.  Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delaney</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> of the confusion so
often experienced by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> between the gerund,
which is a neuter noun, active in meaning, and
the gerundive, which is an adjective of similar form,
but passive in meaning.  Analysand , like several - nd
words in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, is derived from the gerundive, and
so means `(a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>) to be analyzed.'  Similarly, reverend
means `one who is to be revered,' ordinand is `one
who is to be ordained'; an old standby of crossword
compilers, deodand , is a `thing to be given to God,'
and legend is `something to be read.'  We use in their
original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> forms addenda and corrigenda meaning
`things to be added/corrected.'

            An interesting example of a derivative from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">passive</ENAMEX> gerundive that has acquired a quasi-active
meaning is reprimand from reprimendus , `one who is
to be repressed.'  In the course of its transfer to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
through <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> it has become `a severe or formal rebuke,'
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, the act of repressing.



         
         

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Delaney</ENAMEX> asks for further examples of onomatoplazia .
Here are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> which misled me for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>:



hogget  Nothing to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX>.  It is the term applied
to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX>-old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>.

passerine It ought to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> of passage, but it
isn't.  It is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> that perches.
            

            An amusing example of this kind of semantic confusion
will be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter XX</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aldous Huxley</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crome Yellow</ENAMEX> .  From boyhood the romantic, poetically
inclined <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denis Stone</ENAMEX>, found the word carminative
particularly evocative.  It suggested the warmth,
the rosiness ( carmine ) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> and flesh, and, by association
with carmen-carminis , the idea of singing.  To
find out that it meant `able to cure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flatulence</ENAMEX>' was the
death of youth and innoncence.  All the same, in one
respect, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denis</ENAMEX> was right.  The word (like charm ) is
indeed associated with singing, and goes back to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> attempted to cure the ills of the flesh
by incantation.  And, to return to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delaney</ENAMEX>, swimmingly

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Onomatoplazia</ENAMEX> struck a delightful chord for me.
When I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> began to study <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> it took a while to
learn that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gift</ENAMEX> was not something one wanted for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mist</ENAMEX> was not cool and dewy, but
warm and smelly.

            Here are a few of my favourites in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, coupled
with their deceitful meanings:

            In his winning essay [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>] on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s extensive
use of legal language, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D.S. Bland</ENAMEX> makes
one error for sure, and, if I read him rightly, yet another
in the same spot.  He refers to those chilling lines
at the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">III</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ii</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Macbeth invokes Night</ENAMEX>'s
cover for the intended murder of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banquo</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bland</ENAMEX> slips
up when he states it is to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúenable him to proceed on
his path to the murder of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Duncan</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äù  Your Third Prize</ENAMEX>
notwithstanding, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duncan</ENAMEX> was murdered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> pages
earlier.

            The serious error is in his (apparently) thinking
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macbeth</ENAMEX>'s



Cancel, and tear to pieces, that great bond
Which keeps me pale!
            

            relates to night destroying daylight in the sense that
darkness will cancel the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daylight</TIMEX>'s `bond,' whatever
that may be.  No, the bond here is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banquo</ENAMEX>'s lease on
life and his fatherhood, with great alluding to the
supernatural powers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witches</ENAMEX>, especially the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Witch</ENAMEX>.  It is she who had addressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macbeth</ENAMEX>, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I. ii</ENAMEX>, as ‚Äúthat shalt be king hereafter.‚Äù  A few lines later
she confounds him by prophesying that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banquo</ENAMEX> shall
‚Äúget <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  Macbeth</ENAMEX> harps on this mystery after the
witches vanish, muttering to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banquo</ENAMEX> in a tone of envious
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wonderment</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄúYour <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> shall be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tyrant</ENAMEX>'s mind, that great bond really means
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banquo/Fleance</ENAMEX>, both subject to the bonded prophecy
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">uttered by the Third Witch</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> can beget new
offspring safe from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macbeth</ENAMEX>'s hand; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> is the palpable
threat.  Both their lives must be snuffed out immediately,
or the usurper will remain paralyzed, kept
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pale</ENAMEX>, by that unearthly promise.  He views either of
them as the instrument, the bond, of his not being able
to pass on the crown to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> of his choosing (or
of his subsequent begetting).  Yes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Night</ENAMEX> will devour
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Day</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macbeth</ENAMEX>'s significant meaning here is: under
cover of darkness‚Äîin reckless defiance of weird <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">authority‚</ENAMEX>Äîhe
will have his black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> eliminate the
bonded progenitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>, along with his
only progeny.  As it turns out, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fleance</ENAMEX> escapes to fulfill
the prophecy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banquo</ENAMEX> begetting a line of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macbeth</ENAMEX>'s action to have the bond canceled becomes
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">null</ENAMEX> and void.

            True to the terms of the indenture set forth by its
guarantors, that great bond will suffer no default.




         
         

            In answer to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anson</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> point I can only say
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mea culpa .</ENAMEX>  It is the kind of silly slip that we are all
guilty of making from time to time.  Witness <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chester</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delaney</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>] who attributes ‚Äúlowing herd‚Äù to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldsmith</ENAMEX> instead of to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Gray</ENAMEX>.

            As for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macbeth</ENAMEX>'s great bond , this is a crux over
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX> have argued for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.  Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anson</ENAMEX>'s
interpretation is one that has been advanced before
and is dealt with, for example, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Muir</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arden</ENAMEX> edition.  My own reading of the passage turns as
much on the word pale as on bond , but the word limit
set by the essay competition forced me to be rather
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">elliptical</ENAMEX>.  Briefly, I interpret bond as being implicit in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">God</ENAMEX>'s first act of creation‚Äîthe separation of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from day</TIMEX>.  In praying for its cancellation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macbeth</ENAMEX> is
unwittingly asking that chaos should come again, as
indeed it does within the world of the tragedy until the
restoration of order through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macbeth</ENAMEX>'s death and the
assumption of the crown by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX>.

            But my main object in choosing the passage was to
illustrate the way in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> could move
from the literal to the metaphorical or metaphysical in
his use of a legal term.  From that point of view the
differing interpretations Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anson</ENAMEX> and I read into the
passage are of secondary importance.




         
         

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Henn</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúMe Gook‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>] prompts me to
ask which <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX> language his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asians</ENAMEX> were speaking.
If we say ‚Äúthe <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">language‚</ENAMEX>Äù we refer, of course, to
the written language.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Mandarin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cantonese</ENAMEX>,
Fukienese, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hakka</ENAMEX>, etc., tongues often so dissimilar
that verbal intercommunication is impossible.
Only written or printed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> provides the glue to
hold the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Babel</ENAMEX> together.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mandarin</ENAMEX> the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">America</ENAMEX> becomes `beautiful
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>,' as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henn</ENAMEX> says.  In the Romanization
system I learned (and a pox on Peiking/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> for
replacing the clear with the opaque) the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> characters
are transliterated as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mei-kuo</ENAMEX> , disregarding the
tonal diacritical marks.  A roughly approximate atonal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pronunciation</ENAMEX> is thus mƒÅ-gw≈ç .  A family resemblance,
to be sure, but far from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúme gook.‚Äù  So, back to my
question: In which <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX> language is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> `me
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gook‚Äù</ENAMEX>?

            Even on so small an island as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> the
Mandarin-speaking ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mainlanders</ENAMEX> cannot converse
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taiwanese</ENAMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> who have not bothered
to learn <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mandarin</ENAMEX>.  Older <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> are usually
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bilingual</ENAMEX>, but the tongues are their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native Taiwanese</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, a result of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty years</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895-1945</TIMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> ruled the island.  A common sight in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> (either
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>) is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> closely observing the upturned,
outstretched palm of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> while the other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúdraws‚Äù</ENAMEX> ideographs on that palm with a forefinger.  It's
a delight to see the smile of recognition when communication
is established.




         
         

            I found Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Henn</ENAMEX>'s amphigory [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>] on
military slang interesting, but his explanation of the
meaning of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viet</ENAMEX> is at variance with my information.

            Let me begin again by making <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> observations.
First, we must realize there is a difference between
spoken and written <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>.  Next, when looking at a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> character, the symbol can be purely phonetic,
purely semantic, or a combination of both.  Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henn</ENAMEX>
knew that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> could be
translated individually as `extreme' and `south.'  When
he looks at the map it is obvious that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> is to the
extreme south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>.  His misconception
is thus reinforced.

            Let us go back in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> history to the beginning
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warring</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Contending) States Period</ENAMEX>.  At about
this time new powers were arising around the old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heartland</ENAMEX>.  Among them the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ch'in</ENAMEX> (Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henn</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chin</ENAMEX> ) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yueh</ENAMEX> .  As explained by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul W.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kroll</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Oriental Languages</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Literature</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Colorado</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boulder</ENAMEX>),
this new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> called themselves by a name that
was very similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX> word for `extreme.'
Thus in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> spoken language of that time we
have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> homophones, one meant `the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viet</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">kingdom</ENAMEX>),' the other simply `extreme, to exceed.'

            When a literate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> had to write about this
new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> a problem arose as there was no charactter
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viet</ENAMEX>.  The problem was solved simply by
using an already standard character that had a similar
sound to what the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viet</ENAMEX> called themselves.

            For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX> word for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> is used
as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> .  Let
me quote from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John DeFrancis</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Chinese</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Language Fact</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fantasy</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 8</ENAMEX>):



When the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> were confronted with the problem
of expressing foreign terms and names, as happened
on a large scale with the introduction of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhism</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">A.D.</ENAMEX>, they did so by
further extending the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> as
phonetic symbols.  The word <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> itself came to
be represented by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> which at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time
had a pronunciation something like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">b'iwat</ENAMEX> and
now, after a long process of phonological change,
is pronounced f√≥.
            

            It seems the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">character ‚Äúf√≥‚Äù</ENAMEX> is being used phonetically a
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time around in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> .

            Let me emphasize ‚Äúby further extending,‚Äù in the
quote above.  My argument is not that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
pronunciation for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viet</ENAMEX> is ‚ÄúYueh‚Äù but that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henn</ENAMEX>
errs when he translates the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> as `extreme.'
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> is simply a phonological
rendering of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viet</ENAMEX> word meaning `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.'  The correct
translation is the ‚ÄúYueh (or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Viet)‚Äù of the ‚Äúsouth‚Äù</ENAMEX> (as
opposed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúYueh‚Äù</ENAMEX> who used to be just beyond
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">present-day Shanghai</ENAMEX>).




         
         

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Lederer</ENAMEX> notes (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 10</ENAMEX>) that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idiom</ENAMEX> dressed to the nines could be from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle English</ENAMEX>
dressed to then eynes `dressed to the eyes.'  However,
similar expressions in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, and
Judezmo, all mentioning numbers, give pause (they
are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish Language Review</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7, 1987</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 205</ENAMEX>).
It is regrettable that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lederer</ENAMEX> uses the word ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 10</ENAMEX>), which one does not expect to find in
objective writing (see p. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">426</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert A. Hall, Jr.</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Introductory Linguistics</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chilton</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX>).

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Abate</ENAMEX> writes that ‚Äúthe recent comeback [of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> studies] owes much to the recognition of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>'s
pedagogical value, especially as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vocabulary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builder</ENAMEX>,
something both intuitively and statistically known to
be true....  The vocabulary-building argument is a
potent one for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> education...‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p.</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>).  I'm all for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, but there's an easier way
of building your <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vocabulary</ENAMEX> then plowing
through the intricacies of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">morphology</ENAMEX> and syntax.
All you need is a course in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> vocabulary
which, among other things, explains <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> stems and
affixes relevant to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  This is neatly illustrated,
though with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward C. Echols</ENAMEX>' ‚ÄúAlpha
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Privative</ENAMEX> = A-Negative‚Äù immediately above (pp. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14-15</NUMEX>
of the same issue), where, without getting involved in
complicated matters, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> explains almost fifty
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words just by nothing a prefix
and various stems.  Also, since many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> words and
their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Classical Latin</ENAMEX> etymonds share little or no meaning,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Classical Latin</ENAMEX> can at times hinder rather than
help; for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Classical Latin</ENAMEX> conferre has none of
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> meanings of English confer .  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conversely</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">reading English</ENAMEX> meanings into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Classical Latin</ENAMEX>
words can be misleading.)  These differences are due to
semantic change somewhere on the etymological chain
(Medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, etc.).  A
more convincing case for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> studies can be made on
other grounds (if the study of ANY language requires
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pleading</ENAMEX>).  I am happy, by the way, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abate</ENAMEX> did not
say that studying <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> helps you to think clearly‚Äîan
erroneous notion still often heard.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rusine</ENAMEX> should be added to the supplement of English
words ending in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">- ine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 11</ENAMEX>).  After some searching,
it can be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Webster's Third</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rusine</ENAMEX> is not listed
in its alphabetical place, but if you look for it where it

            Madam, I'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam</ENAMEX>, and Other Palindromes

            Here is a friendly, attractive picture-book.  The
fact that the pictures are a full page each with captions
that seesaw across the bottoms (as palindromes
will) would be frustrating were it not for the quality
of the drawings.  As for the quality of the palindromes‚Äîwell,
they are rarely sheer poetry.  After all,

Phrases

            The true etymologies of some words are weird and
fanciful enough‚Äîsometimes unbelievably so‚Äîand it
must be they that inspired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuleja</ENAMEX> to compile this collection,
largely (if not entirely) out of his imagination.
The entry for get one's goat , for example, begins:



In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eleventh-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lapland</ENAMEX>, before they discovered
the nutritional value of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reindeer milk</ENAMEX>, most
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> kept <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX>....
            

            It goes on to describe the `inhabitants‚Äù propensity for
‚Äúgoat-rustling.‚Äù  This is on a par with the attribution of
leave me be to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celtic</ENAMEX> origin having something to do
with a warning against raiding hives or the ascription
of the origin of the name of an obscene prosthetic
device to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Water Isle</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duchess d'√éle</ENAMEX>

Tuleja my sympathies.  Anyone amused by well-done,
outlandish nonsense will enjoy this, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spoof-reader</ENAMEX>'s
delight.

            Word Smart

            If you need this book, it is probably too late‚Äî
unless you are about to take an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GRE</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People</ENAMEX>
should learn vocabulary from reading literature and
listening to articulate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>, not by memorizing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX>.  That said, it must be acknowledged that
some may be in great difficulty if facing an examination,
and if memorizing words and meanings will pull
them through, then they need this book.  The problem
lies, of course, among those who make up examinations
that purport to judge a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s intelligence or
aptitudes on his precise and proper use of words, at
bottom a thoroughly idiotic notion, clearly unrelated
to being a musical or other artistic or mechanical genius
or craftsman.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> of language may be a manifestation
of a certain kind of ability, but nobody is
quite sure how it should be characterized.

            I have nothing particularly adverse to say about
the book.  It would probably fulfill its function if those
impelled to study it learn what it contains‚Äîthen
promptly forget it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> after the exam.  How many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> need words like desiccate, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">didactic</TIMEX>, innocuous,
immutable , etc., when dry up, instructive, harmless ,
and unchanging or unchangeable are around?  Anyone
who doubts the impact of the proper use of simple
language should read (or reread) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knut Hamsun</ENAMEX>'s
Growth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soil</ENAMEX> .  Though a translation, it puts English
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polysyllabicity</ENAMEX> to shame.
