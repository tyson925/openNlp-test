            I can still remember the disappointment I felt,
many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, when I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> discovered that the
phrase to be in the picture had been stolen from me.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> we had a always used this phrase to mean
`to be in the foreground, to play a prominent part.'
If I said, ‚ÄúI'm just not in the picture when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris</ENAMEX> is
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX>,‚Äù this meant that in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris</ENAMEX> I
hardly counted, I was scarcely noticed.  It was a nice,
graphic way of putting it.  Then I came across the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> usage for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, the employment
of the same phrase to mean to `be informed, in the
know.' I was annoyed, I was embittered, for I foresaw
that the genuine <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">English</ENAMEX> usage was going to be
ousted by this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">upstart</ENAMEX>--and how right I was!  I was
all the more annoyed because I knew where the new
meaning came from: from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, from the phrase
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">im Bilde</ENAMEX> sein .  Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Austrian</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">settler</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> had wrongly translated his native
expression into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, the unsupecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
had taken it over, and now we had it round our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">necks</ENAMEX>, while the original, genuine <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> expression
had received the kiss of death.

            Ever since that time I have writhed repeatedly
as I have seen one <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germanism</ENAMEX> after another creep
into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language.  I suppose most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>
who settled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, especially recently, were fairly
literate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, whose sayings were easily taken as
legal tender by the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> tend
to be uncritical and snap up everything new, accepting
the mistakes that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> make as features
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX>.  Today these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Germanisms</ENAMEX> do
not even stay put in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.  They are
promptly exported across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>, so that all
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> now speaks pidgin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>.

            This must actually have begun before my time,
for in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the twenties of this century</TIMEX> I was already
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stubling</ENAMEX> upon what were clearly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Germanisms</ENAMEX> in
use in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.  The dumb blonde who got fresh was
obviously eine dumme <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blondine</ENAMEX>, die frech wurde .  In
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British English</ENAMEX> the verb stem had always meant to
`hold back, resist,' as in stem the tide , for instance.
My <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Concise Oxford Dictionary</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX>) still gives only
that meaning.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, however, had long been
saying that something stemmed from something else,
`was descended from or caused by it,' exactly in the
sense of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stammen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, it was only a beginning.  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> who
wanted to translate their word interessanterweise
into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> tried ‚Äúinterestingly,‚Äù which in those
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> sounded horrible to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> ears; but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
at once pounced on it.  There followed a number
of other, similar formations, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúimportantly</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> must have realized about this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> that the German ending - weise has an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
equivalent, and this was accordingly resuscitated:
the old likewise and crosswise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> was joined by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neologisms</ENAMEX> like countrywise and stylewise .  Then
came hopefully , a word which had long existed in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and meant `in a hopeful manner': you could
apply for a job hopefully because you were `full of
hope.'  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>, however, stumbled upon hope - fully
because they wanted a word for their own hoffentlich ,
admittedly a useful word; so hopefully was
soon being used in a quite different sense, viz.  to
mean `it is to hoped.' Consequently we now have
a measure of confusion, which, be it noted, is not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>, as they have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
words for the two senses: hoffentlich for `it is to be
hoped,' and hoffnungsvoll for `hopeful(ly).'

            Even during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX>, when you
would have expected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Saxons</ENAMEX> to react allergically
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Germanisms</ENAMEX>, they continued to infiltrate
the language.  I remember my astonishment at
hearing ‚ÄúIt's a bit much‚Äù for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time.  This turn
of phrase became very popular in the war, though it
is in fact a direct translation from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">German Es</ENAMEX> ist
               ein bisschen viel .  We did not really need it, for we
had a perfectly good English equivalent: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúIt</ENAMEX>'s a bit
too much.‚Äù In any case, it was a bit too much for me.

            Another is the expression almost nothing .  Had I
written that in an essay when I was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>,
I should have been accused of tone-deafness for
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> idiom.  It was not, in any case, a thing that
any of us would have said.  The idomatic English
was hardly anything .  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>, however, were not to
know this, and brashly translated their fast <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nichts</ENAMEX> .
Granted, in this particular case the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Italians</ENAMEX> might have had a finger in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pie</ENAMEX>, with their
presque rien and quasi niente ; but I feel pretty sure
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> were the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offenders</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> may
of course ask what is wrong with almost nothing ,
and the question is not easy to answer.  The fact is
that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> is, idiomatically, an extremely subtle
language, with many taboos, particularly in the area
of positive/negative statements and degrees of affirmation
and negation.  Why can we say ‚ÄúI haven't
much money,‚Äù but not ‚ÄúI have much money‚Äù?  It is
hard to find a logical explanation, yet these subtle
distinctions are part of the spirit of our language,
and it is this spirit that is easily destroyed forever,
like a delicately balanced biotope, when people
walk roughshod over it.

            Anyone with a good knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> who
finds it amusing to hunt down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germanisms</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX> will soon be reaping rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harvests</ENAMEX>.  I cannot
go into such detail here, though I have come to
the conclusion that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> has been even influenced
basic features of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> language.  For instance,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailboat</ENAMEX> (for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> sailing
               boat ) is surely a copying of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> word-formation
( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Segelboot</ENAMEX> ), as is also ski <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skischule</ENAMEX> ), though
what you learn in such a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> is obviously skiing.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent times</TIMEX> the direct translation of German
phrases into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> seems to have gathered
strength.  It shocked me when one of the leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> textbooks told me in a letter
that he would ‚Äúcome back on‚Äù one of the points
I had raised.  He could easily have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúreturned‚Äù</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúreverted‚Äù</ENAMEX> to it, but the pressure of the German
( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">zuruckkommen auf</NUMEX> ) is evidently too great.  I recently
heard another to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúload off‚Äù is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> at their grandtended
to ‚Äúload off‚Äù his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> at their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>'s:
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> abladen .

            Yet there are things that worry me far more than
these examples.  I strongly suspect the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>, for
instance, of having initiated--or at least aided and
abetted--one of the most disturbing developments
now under way in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English language</ENAMEX>: the disappearance
of the verb may/might .  This verb was formerly
used to express possibility (or sometimes permissibility),
while can had to do with ability.  No
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Englishman</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty years ago</TIMEX>, would ever have been
heard saying ‚ÄúIt could rain.‚Äù  It is quite obvious
that it can rain when it wants to, but what we are
talking about here is not ability but possibility: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúIt</ENAMEX>
may rain,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù ‚ÄúIt</ENAMEX> might rain.‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> are of
course far less likely to use this from in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, for
in their own language they have no alternative to
can : <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Es kann sein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es</ENAMEX> konnte regnen .  They will therefore
tend to use can forms even where they are not
idiomatic in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  In any case, one hardly hears
anything else <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> but these can forms, which have
somehow become the fashion: It can happen , We
could be wrong .  What we are therefore observing is
the loss of a valuable distinction, and in fact the slow
extinction of the verb may/might , an extinction
which in the linguistic world seems to me just as
distressing as the loss of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX> in the zoological
world.  Might we not yet be able, by a united
effort on the part of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language,
to save the world may ?

            Another development that worries me is the
employment of plurals in an adjectival sense.  It has
been a rule in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> from time immemorical to put
a noun into the singular when it is used as an adjective
before another noun.  Thus we have anteaters
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carol singers</ENAMEX> , although they eat <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ants</ENAMEX> and sing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carols</ENAMEX> in the plural.  This rule is upheld even when a
number is specified: a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six-foot</NUMEX> pole, a tenpenny
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stamp</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twenty-mile</NUMEX> stretch .  Yet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> this rule is
being broken more and more often, and the rot certainly
started in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> with such terms as materials handling
and greetings cards .  Nowdays my favorite
scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> talks only of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> firms
and chemicals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> , though such expressions
must surely grate on the ears of anyone who
still has a little feeling for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language.  Do I
need to mention that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> for these expressions
is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drogenfirmen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chemikalienhersteller</ENAMEX> , because
in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> the plural is used in such cases?  Of
course, we cannot blame the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> for making
these mistaked, but we can blame <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>
for swallowing them whole, and with such a blatant
lack of feeling for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> idiom.  As it is, I dare
hardly scrutinize <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> any more for
fear of coming across even more barbaric examples
than those we already have--‚Äúnuts-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crackers</ENAMEX>,‚Äù perhaps,
or ‚Äúwindows <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cleaners</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            There are, I must confess, a few cases in which
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have not followed the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>.  More
and more of them--and alas, more and more
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britons</ENAMEX>--can today be heard talking of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúkiLOMetres</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
[See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.] The other case in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
have not taken <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> as a model is a major catastrophe:
in the words <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion and trillion</NUMEX> .  A <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion</NUMEX> ,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> would think, is a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äúbi-million</NUMEX>,‚Äù that is, a `million
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX>,' and that is exactly what it is in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> as
well as in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, and always was in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British English</ENAMEX>
till the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> pressure queered the pitch.  A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">trillion</NUMEX>
was equally simply a `<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">million million million,‚</NUMEX>Äù
or `<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10\sub\18\sue\</TIMEX>.' With this system, there is also a good word
for a `<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand million</NUMEX>': a milliard , as used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, all clarity has gone by the board
since <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> arbitrarily decided to use <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion</NUMEX> for
a `<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand million</NUMEX>.'  Utter confusion has since
reigned.  Why <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> didn't the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> make
their old mistake and follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>?
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logodaedalian</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Interesting</ENAMEX>
and Unusual Words
            This book appeared originally under the title,
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oxter English Dictionary</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Facts On File</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>),
then as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting</ENAMEX>
Words (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penguin</ENAMEX>, (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>).  As oxter means `armpit,'
the original did not appeal to me and, if I was
sent a review copy, I didn't bother to open the book.
I did not receive a review copy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Penguin</ENAMEX> edition.
The present edition, atrociously overpriced
considering it is a reprint (albeit with some addenda)
is worthy of mention as a dictionary of hard words
with citations.  The editing has been rather careless,
though, as the opening line of HOW TO USE <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">THIS DICTIONARY</ENAMEX>
bears <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> in referring to itself at The
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Penguin Dictionary of ...</ENAMEX> when it clearly has become
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logodaedalian</ENAMEX>'s ...

            There are some other curiosities, not confined
to the unusual words selected but to their usage by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>: in the Introduction he refers to an episode
in which his father completed his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bachelor</ENAMEX>'s
degree ‚Äúat the behest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  The
day the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Marine Corps</ENAMEX> issues ‚Äúbehests‚Äù for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bachelor</ENAMEX>'s
degrees is not yet here.  Another item in the
same section refers to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúforebearing‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, who I
assume are those who had offspring before the author
(clearly a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> using a nom de plume).

            The situation scarcely improves in the dictionary
itself.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saussy III</ENAMEX> does not know what hysteresis
means and missed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pynchon</ENAMEX>'s metaphor by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mile</NUMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">horripilating</ENAMEX> does not mean `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shuddering</ENAMEX>' (though
the rest of the definition is correct); houghmagandy
is defined as `fucking as a pastime,' <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last three</TIMEX>
words of which make in inaccurate; the usual spelling
of gallimaufrey is without the e; gibbous , usually
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to the three-quarter moon, is here
defined as ‚Äúhump-backed, arched‚Äù with the citation,
‚Äú...her upper lip gibbous...as the moon‚Äî,‚Äù
(from pynchon) in which it means `swollen'; guddle ,
‚Äúto use a fishing technique involving the use of only
the hands, to grope‚Äù is not quite correct: it is `to (try
to) catch a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> (esp. a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX>) by tickling its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underbelly</ENAMEX>'
(which is actually easier than it sounds); and
gurn, girn , is incorrectly defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúto snarl</ENAMEX>, to
show the teeth in anger‚Äù: it really means `to make
faces.'

            So much for the relative value of the definitions,
of which the preceding are only a sample.  The interesting
thing in the book is its words list, taken from a
relatively small corpus of books including ones by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burgess</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vonnegut</ENAMEX>, and (especially) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Theroux</ENAMEX>
( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darconville</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cat</ENAMEX> ), all of them <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> who enjoy
playing with the language.  The last-named book
is largely a spoof on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linguistic pedantry</ENAMEX>, and I fear
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saussy III</ENAMEX> has been drawn in.  It is a pity that he
made so many unwarranted assumptions about the
meanings of words he did not understand, could not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">divine</ENAMEX> from the context, or failed to find elsewhere.

            There may be some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> who enjoyed the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two earlier</TIMEX> editions and are craving more.  If so, they
might be induced to buy this edition because it contains
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> pages of words, definitions, and citations not
previously published.  There are, I suppose, worse
things that could happen to you than buying and
reading this book, but it is hard to think of any at the
moment.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Glamour of Grammar</ENAMEX>



            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grammar</ENAMEX> and glamour are historically the same
word.  Back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the eighteenth century</TIMEX> one of
the meanings of grammar was ‚Äúmagic, enchantment‚Äù;
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scots</ENAMEX> let slip the r into an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">l</ENAMEX> , and lo, came
forth glamour .  In the popular mind, grammar is anything
but glamorous.  Whatever magic resides in the
subject is felt to be a sort of black magic, a mysterious
cauldron filled with creepy, crawly things.

            At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Paul's School</ENAMEX> we are convinced that the
study of grammer need not be an arcane, in vacuo ex-
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ericise</ENAMEX>; and all of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> explore the structure of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, from the parts of speech to the phrases and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clauses</ENAMEX>, ultimately applying their knowledge to usage,
punctuation, and sentence creation.

            ‚ÄúEvery self-respecting mechanic,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
Dewey, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúWill</ENAMEX> call the parts of an automobile by their
right names because that is the way to distinguish
them.‚Äù  Thus it is with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>.  If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Pope</ENAMEX>
is correct in asserting that ‚ÄúTrue ease in writing
comes from art, not chance,‚Äù a nameing of the grammatical
parts, we believe, will reduce the chance
and enhance the art, even if the names are one day
forgotten.  And if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> are slipping structural
cogs, we need a common language to communicate
these problems: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúJohn</ENAMEX>, you should use the possessive
form before the gerund‚Äù, ‚ÄúMary, try combining
these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sentences by using an appositive.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúGeorge</ENAMEX>, your sentences are repetitious; try varying
your sentence openings with introductory adverbs,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phrases</ENAMEX>, or clauses.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Ultimately</ENAMEX>, though, our initial
and primary assumption is that, in the words of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">structuralist Paul Roberts</ENAMEX>, ‚Äúthe best reason for
studying grammar is that grammer is interesting.‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grammar</ENAMEX> may not be glamorous in any glittery
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> sense, but grammar can be very interesting,
even enchanting.

            After our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> have completed their study of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">descriptive English</ENAMEX> grammar, they are frequently assigned
the writing of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúsupersentence‚Äù</ENAMEX>--a single
sentence that includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> example of each of the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> phrases and three subordinate clauses that are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">indentified</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> grammar.  These are: prepositional
phrase, participial phrase, gerund phrase, infinitive
phrase, adverb clause, adjective clause, and
noun clause.  These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> may occur in any order in
the sentence.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>, while grading a batch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>sentences,
I decided to try writing one myself, using
the fewest words possible.  (Before continuing, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reader</ENAMEX> may wish to try this feat, too.)  <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">An hour of</TIMEX>
intense industry produced the following:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people 2</ENAMEX> who swing want <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> to see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> what's happening,
they try <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> attending parties 6 given by hipsters.  (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> words)

            

            The numbers in the above sentence indicate the
beginning of each phrase and subordinate clause--
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) adverb clause: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúWhen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who swing want to

modifies the passive participle given .  In subsequent
sentences I shall provide numbers but leave the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reader</ENAMEX> to identify the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, which will appear
in varying orders, so as to avoide cluttering the discussion
with labyrinthine explanations like this one.

            I proudly presented my <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-word concoction to
my departmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> and to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days later</TIMEX> I was summoned by an emissary
from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourth Form</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX> grade) <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> class that
met a few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> from my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>.  I entered
this strange territory, and thereon the chalkboard
was inscribed:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred</ENAMEX>, ' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> wanting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to win <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> playing hard, practised
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more 5</NUMEX> than I, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> who knew 7 he stank.  (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> words)

            

            Among the triumphantly glowing faces in the
alien <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX> was that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Monrad</ENAMEX>, the finest
young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguist</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">our school</TIMEX> at the time.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX>, it
turned out, was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>-word <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>sentence--a
creation that not only contains an elliptical
adverb clause of comparison, ‚Äúthan I [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">practised</ENAMEX>],‚Äù
and a hidden noun clause, ‚Äú[that] he stank,‚Äù
but compacts the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> phrases into the subordinate
part and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> clauses into the main part.

            not to be outdone, I laboured mightily for a few
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and came up with:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> stung 2 by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> what happened, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lederer</ENAMEX> began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX> trying
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> to write better 6 than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monrad</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> who fainted.
(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> words)
            

            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">The next morning</TIMEX> I marched into the rival classroom
and confidently wrote my new sentence on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blackboard</ENAMEX>, only to be instantly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-upped by
young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monrad</ENAMEX>, who stepped forward and inscribed:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Helping 2</ENAMEX> win <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 by 4</NUMEX> scoring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more 5</NUMEX> than I, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> who
thought 7 he stank, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred</ENAMEX> overcome.  (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> words)

            

            Here <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX>'s Brilliant excision of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> word is accomplished
in his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phrase, the infinitive, in which
he lifts out the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">to : ‚ÄúHelping</ENAMEX> [to] win by scoring....‚Äù

            Now I was growing desperate.  Word of the contest
had spread throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Paul's School</ENAMEX>.  How
could I ever again face my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
if I were to be defeated by a mere stripling?
The whole affair was beginning to give the lie to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cobbett</ENAMEX>'s resigned admission: <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúThe</ENAMEX> study
of grammar is dry.  It engages not the passions.<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äù  Resolving</ENAMEX>
not to give out, up, or in, I closeted myself
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the entire weekend</TIMEX> and finally emerged with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúEureka!‚Äù</ENAMEX> on my lips, for I had written:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Helping 2</ENAMEX> win <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> overcoming <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> what threatened,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lederer</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> who persisted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7</TIMEX> when challenged, triumphed.
(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> words)
            

            In addition to being eminently readable, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>sentence
is characterized by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> clever strokes: a
clause within a phrase within phrase within a
clause within a phrase in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> words, and
the distillation of the adverb clause into a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-word
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster, ‚Äúwhen</ENAMEX> [he was] challenged,<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äù</ENAMEX> instead of the
previous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> words, ‚Äúmore than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.‚Äù</ENAMEX>  Not only are
all the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> as concise as they can be, but, with
the exception of the subject, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leadere</ENAMEX> , all nouns, adjectives,
and adverbs are now replaced by phrases
and clauses.  This sentence was traveling at the speed
of light.  I could become no smaller.  Or so I thought.

            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> I strutted into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">classroom</ENAMEX> and hubristically engraved my ‚Äúultimate‚Äù
supersentence on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>, delivering a
learned lecture proving that we had reached the end
of the road supersentencewise.  As I wheeled to
leave, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX> giggled, ‚ÄúNot so fast, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lederer</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  He
then explained that he too had discovered the formula
for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-word adverb clause and that, moreover,
he had been able to replace all nouns, adjectives,
and adverbs with phrases and clauses.  He then
chalked up:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Whoever <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> dafring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> oppose 4 by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> fighting
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6</TIMEX> when oppressed, 7 which overcomes, conquers,
(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> words!)

            

            While reaching the theoretical limit for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>sentences,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX>'s creation is rather awkward, with
the adjective clause, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúwhich</ENAMEX> overcomes,‚Äù emerging
as a dangling modifier.  Still, I have never been able
to improve on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX>'s effort, and I invite VERBATIM
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> to submit more graceful and coherent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>sentences
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> words.  Like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> choosing
sides for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> game, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX> and I have run our
hands up the bat, and there isn't any wood left.  Actually,
we have both won; and when the game of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grammar</ENAMEX> is played with a sense of enjoyment and
humor, everyone can be a winner.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernstein</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Reverse Dictionary</ENAMEX>;
            As a practicing lexicographer (I have complied
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> bilingual dictionaries with illustrative
sentences), but more important, as one who continually
has trouble retrieving certain <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words
from my mental lexicon, I consider this book a real
gold <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>.  The blurb on the back of has it
absolutely right: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúA new and expanded edition of
the popular `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reinvention</ENAMEX>' of the standard dictionary
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> created by legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> language
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expert Theodore Bernstein</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  Although I seldom
work crossword puzzles, this is a must book for the
crossword-puzzle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addict</ENAMEX> or even the occasional
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX>.

            I like this dictionary because, like most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,
I often find myself groping for words that are right
‚Äúon the tip of my tongue.‚Äù  How many of you, like
me, cannot always remember that a rhinologist is the
medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> dealing with nasal problems?
(Why not a nasologist ?) Even after memorizing osteologist
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">skeleton</NUMEX>), heterologist (tissue), or helcologist
(<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ulcers</ENAMEX>), I have difficulty in remembering these particular
words.  I have occasionally confused a hematologist
(<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>) with a hepatologist (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>).  And many
of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in introductory linguistics courses
confuse etymology (word origins) with entomology
(the study of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>).  Now that I have succeeded in
getting you to see that a reserve dictionary is much
more than a thesaurus with which, of course, it
shares some similarities, its purpose is really to list
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">definations</ENAMEX> in alphabetical order which, in turn, will
give you the word that you have forgotten, confused,
or just plain do not know or cannot recall.

            One can quibble, as always, with some of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">definitions</ENAMEX> presented in any dictionary, so this work
is not different from many others in this respect.  For
instance, a `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wrestler</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boxer</ENAMEX> over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</NUMEX> pounds' is
called a heavyweight (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p.274</ENAMEX>). I do not think I have
ever seen (on TV's professional wrestling) a heavyweight
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wrester</ENAMEX> who weighted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</NUMEX>; most of them
weight over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>.  Although this is a picayunish point,
consider that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wrestlers</ENAMEX> are also divided up, according
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, into lightweight, featherweight,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">welterweight</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">middleweight</ENAMEX> , and heavyweight , as are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boxers</ENAMEX>.  To my knowledge, these terms are not normally
used in professional (dare we call it <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúentertainment‚Äù</ENAMEX>)
wrestling as they are in professional and
amateur <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">boxing</ENAMEX>.

            Under language <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 133 and p. 271</ENAMEX>), one
finds logogogue whereas I would have thought the
proper choice to be linguist or perhaps even the
awkward linguistician (a term to be avoided).  Also,
I fail to see how polyglot (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p.133</ENAMEX>) can be defined as
`language mixture' since it merely refers to a multilingual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>.  `Language mixture' may refer to
what linguists call pidginization and creolization of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">languages</ENAMEX>, a process of language simplification (although
even this is misleading and not the entire
story).

            To illustrate how useful the volume can be, let
us assume that you have heard the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> common <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loanwords</ENAMEX> used in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, schlimazel and schlemiel .
How do you find them in a reserve dictionary?
You have to remember that both refer to a bungler
or bungling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, and that is indeed what you have
to look under to find them.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernstein</ENAMEX> explains in the introduction (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. vii</ENAMEX>)
how he got the idea for the book in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place.
He was chatting with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>,
and in the course of the conversation he remarked
that the words won ton (a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dumpling</ENAMEX> used as
an ingredient in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX> of the same name) ‚Äúmade
perhaps even more sense if they were read backward.‚Äù
His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> immediately replied ‚Äú‚Äî just
like in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madam</ENAMEX> , I'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam</ENAMEX> .‚Äù  And neither one could
retrieve the word for something which read the
same forwards or backwards.  ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palindrome</ENAMEX>, of
course!)  If you are still addeled, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">addle-brained</ENAMEX> , or addlepated
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 49</ENAMEX>), do not be: look up `confused' in this
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>!  If you like words (and are looking for a
great game to play at your next coctail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>), this
book is definitely for you.  About the nicest compliment
I could give <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernstein</ENAMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grambs</ENAMEX>) for producing
this excellent work is to remark, why did I
not think of doing it first?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan S. Kaye</ENAMEX>
            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fullerton</ENAMEX>
            
         
         
            Words <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">That Make a Difference</ENAMEX>
            This book was first published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>
Books as Words in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Action</ENAMEX> .  Although that is a better
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title</ENAMEX> than the new one, something more apropos
would be <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Words to Impress Your Friends By</ENAMEX> .  Its main
goal is to increase your vocabulary.  As any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> knows, there are many books on the market
designed to do exactly this; however, one can
rarely get through <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than the first few</TIMEX> chapters
of such tomes.  This volume, I am happy to report, is
different.  I recommend it for those (as the book's
cover observes): <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äú‚</ENAMEX>Äîwho want to speak more effectively,
write more colorfully or be better prepared
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAT‚Äù</ENAMEX> (the verbal portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scholastic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Aptitude Test</ENAMEX>, a widely used instrument for
university admission).

            The reason that most books of this type ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">How to</ENAMEX>
Increase Your <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5</NUMEX> Words in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Days or Double Your</ENAMEX>
Money Back [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Satisfaction Guaranteed</ENAMEX>]) fail is that
they are boring, or mundance, or both.  The reader
gets the book home and proceeds to memorize polysyllabic
words by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX>, with their lenghthy definitions
coupled with made-up sentences which often
make little sense or, if they do make sense are
dull at best.  Then the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> gets through the mechanical
task of taking multiple-choice examinations
or fill-in-the-blank quizzes, which are usually a
waste of time because the words and its meaning are
usually forgotten within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.

            How does this book then differ from the competition?
For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> has taken as illustrative
examples many important words and expressions
from the rather lively and well-composed
pages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York Times</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,455</NUMEX>) lexemes, to be
exact, although we can quible about some of the
entries).  For another, the definitions are, on the
whole, well written and to the point.  For example,
consider the word electic , which is defined as:
‚Äúcomposed of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> or ideas gathered from a variety
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  Its meaning is illustrated quite
nicely by the following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> passage:


Live <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">artillery shells</ENAMEX>, a dead sea <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtle</ENAMEX> half the size
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagen Bettle</ENAMEX>, a drowned giraffe, antique
crockery, pocketbooks, chemical sludge,
raw sewage and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 5,000 cords</NUMEX> of driftwood
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>--the waters of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York Harbor</ENAMEX> yield a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strage</ENAMEX> and eclectic bounty.

            

            Most of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,455</NUMEX> examples are excellent
choices, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenman</ENAMEX>'s definitions and illustrations
are well done; there are, however, some significant
errors to report.

            Under the term lingua franca (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 196</ENAMEX>), for instance,
we learn that ‚Äúthe original lingua franca (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>,
Frankish language) was a hybrid language...
spoken...in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>.  It consisted mostly
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> words without their inflections.‚Äù  Linguists
have demonstrated that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> lingua <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">france</ENAMEX> (called
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mediterranean Lingua Franca</ENAMEX> by many linguists) was
actually spoken before the first <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Crusade</ENAMEX> began in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.D.</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1096</TIMEX>.  There is a document written in it from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Djerba</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tunisia</ENAMEX>, dating from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.D.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1353</TIMEX>.  In addition to Italian
vocabulary, the language also included many items
from another <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Romance language</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Proven\</ENAMEX>ccedil\al.  As mediterrancean
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lingua Franca</ENAMEX> was used on the Barbary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Africa</ENAMEX>, there were many words that it
borrowed from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX>.  In fact, one
such word is savvy (`shreed; in the know'), which
Greenman erroneously derivers (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 284</ENAMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>
sabe usted `do you know?' The word came into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lingua Franca</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX>.  That is not
such a serious error, however, since <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX>
are closely related.

            Some of the book's lexical entries are questionable.
I see no reason to include, for instance, the
following words: antiseptic, novel, nosh (`snack,'
from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novice</ENAMEX>, theorem, threshold , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tycoon</ENAMEX> .
I believe all of these, with the exception of nosh , are
fairly well known by the average college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">freshman</ENAMEX>,
though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> may decide for themselves if I am
wrong on this point.  I do not consider the word nosh
important enough, or for that matter frequent
enough, to have been included.  Certainly, it is
doubtful that one would encounter it on an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> examination.
I have exactly the same sentiment for
chutzpah `brazen nerve' (from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Herbrew</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>),
which is also included (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 62</ENAMEX>), as well as bubkes
`something trivial' (from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian via Yiddish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 46</ENAMEX>).
However, one must remember that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York</ENAMEX>
Times is read in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, which has a sizable jewish
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, and these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> examples are probably
known and used by most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Yorkers</ENAMEX> (even
gentiles, such as the late authour and raconteur <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexander</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX>, one of my all-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorites</ENAMEX> and a regular
on the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Paar Show</ENAMEX>, who used them regularly

            I am delighted to report that the special diacritica
are shown for the common <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> loanwords
like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nat</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">\i2dot\</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">vet√© `artlessness</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ingenuousness</ENAMEX>' (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p.</ENAMEX>

and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congeniality</ENAMEX>' (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 145</ENAMEX>).  These diacritical marks
are now, unfortunately, left off in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX>,
so we must praise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenman</ENAMEX>'s efforts here.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> things are going in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">periodicals</ENAMEX>, diacritics
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> will soon be a thing of the past.

            One can also find some definitions here and
there that are not entirely wrong yet with which one
might disagree.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamikaze</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 187</ENAMEX>), for example, is
defined as: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúa suicide attack by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> airplane
pilot in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>; the airplane or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> in such an
attack.‚Äù  In my own semantic system (and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is
my native language), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamikaze</ENAMEX> does not usually
mean `a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>' because I have to say `<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kamikaze</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>'
to refer to someone who is involved in a kamikaze
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX>.

            The pronunciation transcrition system (see the
Key, pp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) the book uses follows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.B.C.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Handbook of Pronunciation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Y. Crowell</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX>), Which is imprecise and hard to interpret in
many places.  I have never understood why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phonetic Alphabet</ENAMEX> is not used in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
dictionaries of all sorts, but this is beyond the scope
of our remarks in this review.  I would certainly recommend
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.P.A.</ENAMEX> here.

            An extra treat ends the book (pp. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">343-379</ENAMEX>).
Short essays on verbs of action, puns, slang (we are
told that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wimp</ENAMEX> was popular during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">'70s, p. 348</ENAMEX>; how about the ' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">80s</NUMEX> where it was very
frequently used in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> election campaign?),
nuance words, and how to use the colon, semicolon,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dash</ENAMEX>, and parentheses.

            I found the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> essays the most entertaining
and particularly useful: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúE Pluribus Unum: The</ENAMEX>

such common errors as carat for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">karat</NUMEX> .  In case you
do not see the point with these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words, the book
is probably for you.  (Even many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> have
this wrong, as carat is not a free variant of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">karat</NUMEX> ,
although both derive from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> q<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">\itilde\r\atilde\t.  ‚</NUMEX>ÄúGemstones

            As you have no doubt already surmised, this is
not (to use another <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Greenman</ENAMEX> word) a schlock (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p.</ENAMEX>

            I lived <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Galef</ENAMEX>'s ‚ÄúBackwords and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newances‚</ENAMEX>Äù
[XVI<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX>], but he certainly is not a techie (from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">technician</ENAMEX>, usually electronic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technician</ENAMEX> `<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> familiar
with and capable of dealing with technology')

            There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> ways of transmitting a desired
telephone number from your telephone (instrument).
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is pulse .  This is the method used
since the invention of the automatic telephone exchange
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strowger</ENAMEX> and others early in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX>.
It operates by electrically acting as if the receiver
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">handset</NUMEX>) had been rapidly and repeatedly replaced
on the little pushbuttons (hook switch) inset into the
top recess (cradle) of the main portion of the telephone
(base).  Phone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">freaks</ENAMEX> sometimes dial by rapid
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jiggling</ENAMEX> (jiggling) of the hook switch, which is the
same action as far as the telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> (central
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>) equipment (switch) is concerned, but I'm getting
too old and can't do this fast enough any more.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> ‚Äúdialing‚Äù method is tone (DTMF or
dual-tone multi-frequency).  The trademarked name,
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>, is touch-tone¬Æ, which operates by sending
more-or-less musical tones from your instrument
to the switch to specify the number desired.  Pulsetone,
as mentioned in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Galef</ENAMEX>'s footnote, is the label
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">placard</NUMEX>) on an instrument for a switch that adjusts
the instrument to operate on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or the other.
‚ÄúPulse-tone‚Äù is not a technical term.

            Rotary phones have the familiar dial, with a circular
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motion</ENAMEX> and finger holes.  They invariably dial
by the pulse method; although it is certainly technically
feasible to arrange for them to dial with tones,
nobody has figured out why anyone would want to
do so.  Pushbutton phones have pushbuttons (sometimes
techies are not terribly imaginative with language--it's
not usually their strong suit).  Pushbutton
phones often are arranged so that they may
generate either pulses or tones (thus the switch).
Some switches cannot handle tones, and often there
is an extra charge for touch-tone¬Æ service so some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> must have pulse phones.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> method is digital , and I'm not going to
go into that.  It's too techie.

            I enjoyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Galef</ENAMEX>'s definition of backword
to mean the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">modifier</ENAMEX> added to a previously specific
word which has been made generic by the advent of
a new technology.  I cannot add anything to his excellent
treatment of the etymology but can respond
to his uncertainty in one of the technical areas.

            The generic term, computer , was extended beyond
its human meaning to refer to computing machines
during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II.  All these machines
were, indeed, what are now known as analog (or analogue)
computers .  They were mechanical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analogs</ENAMEX> of
the objective processes, used in such devices as gun
aiming systems and bombsights.

            The advent of the digital computer , after the
war, necessitated the modifying of the old term by
the backword, analog , to distinguish it from the new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digital</ENAMEX> computer.

            The analog computer does not compute by
means of discreate voltages or any other physical
quantity.  Rather, it embodies a continuous physical
process that is an analog, often in a different medium,
for the process for which information is desired.
By measuring the instantaneous value of quantities
in the analog, we can determine the value of
their analogous quantities in the object process.

            The digital computer, on the other hand, simply
performs arithmetic operations by counting very
quickly.  When dealing with a continuous process, it
can only compute its state at discrete instants of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, since it only manipulates discrete numbers.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analog</ENAMEX> and digital timepieces are, in fact, computers
where the object process is the continuous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motion of the Earth</ENAMEX>.  The fact, however, is that both
are analog computers.  The analog process in a mechanical
watch is the motion of the pendulum or balance
wheel and, in quartz watches, the electrical
wave produced by a crystal oscillator.  Both count
the oscillations to determine the passage of time and
transform the analog signal into a digital <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.  They
differ only in the method used to display the results.
The analog watch converts the digital counts back
into a more or less continuous movement of the
hands.  The digital watch simply prints out the numerical
count in proper format.

            It is my belief that those who originally coined
the terms analog and digital watch intended only to
describe the display, not the underlying physics or
any relationship to computers.  An analog display
moves continuously, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> or time, and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digital</ENAMEX> display shows numbers.

            To my knowledge, the only timepieces that are
truly digital are the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">atomic ‚Äúclocks‚Äù</ENAMEX> used as time
standards that operate by counting discrete particles
emitted by a radioactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX>.

            Returning to etymology, clock in the above
paragraph is incorrect in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">horological</ENAMEX> usage.  Strictly
speaking, clock should only be used when referring
to a timepiece that also incorporates a striking
mechanism to sound out the time at regular intervals.
The word stems from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> word for
`bell,' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glocke</ENAMEX> .

            The Lot of Malarkey


            The derivation of malarkey , a term still frequently
heard in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, is nowhere to be found.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> does not list it.  The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> , like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> , seems to have tried to
find the derivation but given up, as have other standard
references.

            Suggestions that the word came from an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish</ENAMEX>
name--a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malarkey</ENAMEX>, for example--lead nowhere.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ugandan</ENAMEX> prophet called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Malaki</ENAMEX> or Madam
Misharty, a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1930s'</NUMEX> fortune teller known for her exaggerated
claims and predictions, did not seem
worth pursuing.  But an examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Partridge</ENAMEX>'s
A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English</ENAMEX>
(Routledge & <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kegan Paul</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX>) yields the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> malakia , defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúmasturbation‚Äù</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äútricky.</ENAMEX>‚Äù

            So directed, one can peruse a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionaries</ENAMEX>--especially <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Creighton</ENAMEX>'s ‚ÄúMega Hellano-Anglikon
Lexikon, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 919</ENAMEX>)--and read definitions
emphasizing delicacy, softness, effeminacy in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, homosexuality, and masturbation.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malacia</ENAMEX> is
used in pathology for an abnormal softening of part
of an organ.  (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incidentally</ENAMEX>, for whatever reasons,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionaries</ENAMEX> published by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford University Press</ENAMEX>
either do not list malakia or show it but avoid including
any reference to masturbation.) Another, apparently
related, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> word, malaka , is defined by
Creighton as ‚Äúsoftening of the brain, stupidity, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imbecility</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1988 World Almanac</ENAMEX> cites these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and

order of highest percentages.  Considering all that I
have examined, I suggest the following background
to a derivation:

            Around the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX> (before or

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>, settling mostly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> mentioned.  The
term malakia was commonly used in popular (i.e.,
not polite) speech, much like our Don't give me that
jazz or Quit jerking me around .  How did the term
spread around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, if indeed it did?  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Twenty-five years ago</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ren√</ENAMEX>©
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etiemble</ENAMEX> launched his now classic Parlez-vous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">franglais</ENAMEX> ?  It was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cri de coeur</ENAMEX> of a single-minded
patriot beset by the idea that the purity of his
mother tongue was being corrupted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>-maniac
leanings of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">countrymen</ENAMEX>.  Disgustedly, he
pointed at words like cockpit, bowling, snack , and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of others, constantly used by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sportsmen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX>--in fact, everybody.
Lest the national language be eventually supplanted
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">le</ENAMEX> sabir atlantique (the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> pidgin), he urged
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to set up a system of penalties to
divert the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">linguistic polluters</ENAMEX> from the path of sin.

            Feelings of bitterness did not keep the author
from presenting his admonitions in an easily digestible
style.  All the fire and brimstone were wrapped
in a lighthearted tone and padded with humorous
remarks.  The book became enormously popular, and
the term <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franglais</ENAMEX> entered the world's dictionaries.
But most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> happily went on introducing words
like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">le</ENAMEX> workshop, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">le</ENAMEX> tour-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> (they insist on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyphen</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">le</ENAMEX> self (self-service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">le</ENAMEX> must (the

Even now, it becomes a bit easier <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> for an
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> to read a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>.

            However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etiemble</ENAMEX>'s appeal caught on with the
powers that were.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only two years</TIMEX> after the
publication of the book, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Gaulle</ENAMEX>, then
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, established a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High Committee</ENAMEX>
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defence</ENAMEX> and the Expansion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
Language.  Through subsequent legislation each government
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> was equipped with one or several
terminology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commissions</ENAMEX> with the responsibility
of compiling lists of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúapproved terms‚Äù</ENAMEX> in their
respective spheres.  The use of these terms is statutorily
required, not only in official documents, but also
in all business correspondence and advertising (including
labels, catalogues, waybills, etc.), employment
contracts, radio and television programs,
notices in public places, and certain schoolbooks.
Replacing such a term by a foreign equivalent is a
penal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offense</ENAMEX>, and may cost the offender anything
from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$90 to $200</NUMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of the Commissioner General</ENAMEX> for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Language</ENAMEX>, a supervisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, has recently
published a new edition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictionnaire des N√</ENAMEX>©
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ologismes Officiels</ENAMEX> , which lists the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX>-odd terms
so far approved (plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 400</NUMEX> ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù
ones whose use is obligatory for certain publications
only).  To judge from this batch, the purge is going to
be less radical than one would expect from a system
professedly resting on the tenets of linguistic protectionism.
Indeed, quite a few of the listed terms are
identical to their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> (in spelling,
that is: this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> rarely interferes with pronunciation).
Examples: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adobe</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">`adobe</ENAMEX>,' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> for
`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>,' drone for ` <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drone</ENAMEX> ' (in military avionics).
More than that, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictionnaire</ENAMEX> gives its blessing
also to several words of blatantly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> stock,
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, drugstore , and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipeline</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pronounce:</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pea-PLEAN</ENAMEX>), even including portmanteau words ( bit,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pixel</ENAMEX> ) and acronyms ( laser, radar ).

            Along with these outright borrowings came hybrids
composed of an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> root and a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> suffix,
such as clonage for `cloning,' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scorer</ENAMEX> for `to score,'
nurserie for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">`nursery' (`fish</ENAMEX>-breeding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>'), and
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">supporteur/supportrice</ENAMEX> for `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporter</ENAMEX>.'  In some
cases, slight spelling changes have been applied, but
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> origin remains unmistakable: chalengeur
for `challenger,' dribler for `to dribble,' m√©dia (mandatory
plural: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">m√©dias</ENAMEX> ) for `media,' astronaute for `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">astronaut</ENAMEX>.'
(The last term seems, in both languages, a
rather hyperbolic denomination for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who
travels <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">less than two light-seconds</TIMEX> away from his
home planet.  But then, it is modest compared to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cosmonaut</ENAMEX> .)  Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictionnaire</ENAMEX>'s Anglicisms
have undergone more drastic transcriptional
surgery, e.g. gazole for `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas oil</ENAMEX>,' fioul for `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>'
(<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>), roquette for `rocket,' bipasse for `bypass.'

            All this seems a far cry from the uncompromising
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overhaul Etiemble</ENAMEX> must have hoped for.  To his
mind, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> was a rich enough language to meet
any new requirements from domestic resources.  He
might even have snubbed the many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dictionnaire</ENAMEX> entries
created by literal translation of the imagery embodied
in the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> term, as souris
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">`mouse</ENAMEX>' (of a personal computer) or retomb√©es
for (nuclear) `fallout.'  Application of this method to
compounds results in calques like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">banque de donn√</ENAMEX>©es
for `data <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>' or atterrissage sur <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">le</ENAMEX> ventre for `belly
landing.'  However, since <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compounds</ENAMEX> tend to
be rather explicit, and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> are generally
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strung</ENAMEX> together by all kinds of grammatical particles
(conjunctions, prepositions, articles), this
method often leads to tapewormish constructions,
such as espace extra-atmosph√©rique for `outer space'
or boucle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">en √©pingle √† cheveux</ENAMEX> for `hairpin loop.'

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etiemble</ENAMEX> would probably have warmed more
readily to entires which in no way derive from an
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> model, like logiciel for `software,' ax√©nique
(`without foreign matter') for `germfree,' or suramplificateur
for `booster.'  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictionnaire</ENAMEX> offers
many such ingenious coinages but they generally
lack the pithiness and sprightliness that enliven such
a great deal of scientific and technological terminology
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  Vibreur sonore for `buzzer,' tireur
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">isol√©</ENAMEX> (`lone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rifleman</ENAMEX>') for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">`sniper</ENAMEX>,' and mitraillage au
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sol</ENAMEX> (`machinegunning towards the ground') for
`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strafing</ENAMEX>' are of course correct, but they sound like
punctilious definitions rather than handy appellations.
Even more ponderous are exposition inter-professionnelle
for `trade show,' transport maritime √°
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">la</ENAMEX> demande for `tramping' (the activity of tramp
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">steamers</ENAMEX>), and v√©hicule lourd de d√©pannage for
`wrecker.'  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heavyweight champion</ENAMEX> is perhaps
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contrat √°</ENAMEX> terme <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d'instrument</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX> for what they
call `financial futures' at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>.  Unsur-prisingly,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> law shows little patience for
the charming onomatopoeias which the technical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have invented for audio equipment and its
tantrums, like `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tweeter</ENAMEX>' and `boomer,' or `wow' and
`hum.' The renderings imposed by the latter-day index
expurgatorius are, respectively, haut-parleur
d'aigus (tolerated second choice: tuiteur), haut-parleur
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de graves</ENAMEX> (ditto: boumeur), pleurage (`weeping'),
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ronflement</ENAMEX> (`snoring').

            To be sure, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictionnaire</ENAMEX> does not consist exclusively
of naturalized or Frenchified alien words
and wordy phrases of bureaucratic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">facture</ENAMEX>.  Many an
entry had already had a life of its own before a ministerial
decree raised it to its present status.  Some of
them are real gems: tableur (`tabular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX>') for
`spreadsheet' is concise, precise, and original;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">baladeur</ENAMEX> (`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stroller</ENAMEX>') for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">`walkman</ENAMEX>,' although basically
a loan translation, adds a fresh nuance to the
imagery; best of all perhaps is ordinateur for `computer,'
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> term (current since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>,
adopted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictionnaire</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>) meaning something
like `methodically arranging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>.'  Since the
machine is not, as generally believed in former
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, a new kind of calculator but rather a high-speed
symbol manipulator, ordinateur hits the mark.

            Whatever the merits of all those novelties, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> seem to have a relaxed attitude to the disciplinary
aspects.  They use both prescribed and proscribed
terms, depending probably on efficiency,
personal preferences, and `what others do.'  In one
respect, however, they are unanimous.  They stick to
an odd collection of English words which have a different
meaning or are nonexistent in English-speaking
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.  As in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Etiemble</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, they say smoking
for `dinner jacket' and slip for `underpants.'  The
choke in an automobile is still referred to as starter
(the real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">starter</ENAMEX> is called <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">d√©marreur</ENAMEX>), and a female
radio or TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcer</ENAMEX> as speakerine.  And they have
lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>: rugbymen, tennismen, taximen,
recordmen, comingmen, etc.  When the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> were still enlivened by streetcars (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tramways</ENAMEX>), there were even wattmen.

            Conquering Conch


            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s culinary eccentricity has often determined
the name by which the rest of humanity
comes to know them.  The predilection for the flesh
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strombus</ENAMEX> gigas, the queen conch, by the white
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bahamians</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Keys</ENAMEX> is
cited by many etymologists in explaining the origin
of the appellation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conch</ENAMEX> for a `native or inhabitant
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Keys</ENAMEX>' or a `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bahamian</ENAMEX>.'

            I am a native of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Keys</ENAMEX>, as was my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, but I was never called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conch</ENAMEX> in my home
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX>.  Only since moving to the mainland have I
been tagged a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Conch</ENAMEX>, and, as some dictionaries now
define any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Keys</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Conch</ENAMEX>, I
no longer demur.  But can a black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>
Keys be a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Conch</ENAMEX>?  I have never known of the
word being used in this way except when referring
to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> fielded by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Key West</ENAMEX> High
School (the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Key West Conchs</ENAMEX>).

            I was told by a black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bahamian</ENAMEX> that the origin of
the word <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conch</ENAMEX> came from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conchy Joe</ENAMEX> which is the
black <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamian</ENAMEX> equivalent of `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">whitey</ENAMEX>.'  You see, the
inner surface of the queen conch <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shell</ENAMEX> has a color
that approximates that of the epidermis of the Bahamians
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> ancestry.  While folk etymology
might be at play here, this explanation certainly
seems possible and may explain another etymological
puzzle.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of my dictionaries inform me that the origin
of the term honky is unknown, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beresky</ENAMEX>'s
articulate arguments for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúhunky‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX>] have not
swayed me.  Now honky means `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">whitey</ENAMEX>' and rhymes
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conchy</ENAMEX>.  May I suggest that honky was (I no
longer hear it!) a corruption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conchy</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX>)?

         
         

            As an addendum to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton Horowitz</ENAMEX>'s letter
[XVI<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX>] about the depiction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX> with horns, I
want to come to the defense of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome</ENAMEX>.  That holy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curmudgeon</ENAMEX> is usually chided for translating <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Exodus</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">34:29</TIMEX> incorrectly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vulgate Bible</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, I have
few scholarly works to which to refer, but I looked
confidently into my battered copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Robinson</ENAMEX>'s
A <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">English Lexicon of the Old Testament</ENAMEX>
(25th <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edition</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1888</TIMEX>).  This is a translation and
amplification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gesenius</ENAMEX>' original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> work.

            Of the entries under qaran (pp. 943f.) only the
use in this passage is translated without some reference
to ‚Äúhorn.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Robinson</ENAMEX> notes initially with regard
to this verb that the primary syllable should be compared
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanskrit</ENAMEX> carnis `horn,' from car `to
bore.'  The derivative forms (qeren, etc.) are all translated
with some reference to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúhorn,‚Äù except the
dual form, qarnaim, which is translated ‚Äúrays of
light, splendour.‚Äù  But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX> goes on to note
even with this form: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúSo Arabian poets</ENAMEX> compare the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> rays of the rising sun to horns; and hence call
the sun itself the gazelle....‚Äù

            Even more illuminating is an entry (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 944</ENAMEX>):
‚ÄúHence in prophetic vision, horns are‚Äù symbolic of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúkings</ENAMEX>, powerful princes...‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daniel</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:24 and 8:21</TIMEX>
are cited.  And then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robinson</ENAMEX> bids us compare ‚Äúthe
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> epithet of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great‚</ENAMEX>Äù which he
translates as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> word, bicornis `<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-horned.'
He goes on to observe that this is ‚Äúthe symbol of
power, might; so both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> and the Seleucidae
are represented on coins with horns....‚Äù

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Septuagint</ENAMEX> translates qaran , in the passage
of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Exodus 34:29</ENAMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> verb used in the New
Testament to mean: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúto praise, extol, magnify, celebrate;
to honor, do honor to, hold in honor; to make
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glorious</ENAMEX>, adorn with lustre, clothe with splendor; to
make renowned, render illustrious, i.e., to cause the
dignity and worth of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> or thing to become
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">manifest</ENAMEX> and acknowledged; to exalt to a glorious
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rank</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">condition</ENAMEX>...‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thayer</ENAMEX>, A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>
Lexicon of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Testament</ENAMEX>).  How readily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome</ENAMEX> might associate these meanings of the more
philosophical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> with the horn imagery of power
in the more ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hebrew</ENAMEX>.

            The symbolism of power conveyed by horns and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">horn</ENAMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> (and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Semitic</ENAMEX>) words as
portrayed on the aforementioned coins (or some
others, which might have used the same imagery but
which are no longer extant) may well have led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome</ENAMEX> to his translation.

            In any case, his translation, in light of the foregoing,
seems as plausible to me as the exceptional
usage given approval by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúaccepted‚Äù translations</ENAMEX>.
So, before we fault <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome</ENAMEX> for a blunder,
let us consider that so impressive a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguistic scholar</ENAMEX>
as he may have chosen to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX> horns deliberately
by using cognate imagery he understood to
stand for dignity and power.

            [By the way, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo</ENAMEX>'s statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX>
(with horns) is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Pietro</ENAMEX> in Vincoli

was spelled incorrectly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">VERBATIM.</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX>]

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lysander Kemp</ENAMEX> reminded me of a malapropism
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> which I created for myself.  When I was
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> moved from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buenos Aires</ENAMEX>.
My <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother</ENAMEX>, who believed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> should
learn languages as early as possible, dropped me into
the local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Argentine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> where I absorbed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>
by a kind of osmosis--except for one phrase.  In
school we sang a song the first line of which was:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúEn los</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patios</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la</ENAMEX> escuela <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la cesando el</ENAMEX> gran rumor.‚Äù
(In the school patios the great noise--`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hubbub</ENAMEX>'--is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ceasing</ENAMEX>).  I happily sang: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúEn los</ENAMEX> patios de
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">la escuela va Cesandro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el Gran Rumor</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  who
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúCesandro‚Äù</ENAMEX> was or why he was the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Rumor</ENAMEX>,
whatever that was, I hadn't the faintest idea but obviously
he was out in the patios while we were in
class.  It was very <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years before</TIMEX>, remembering
this, I realized what I had been supposed to be singing.



         
         


            I recently purchased a new computer, and, because
it operated on a system different from the one of
my old computer, I asked a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> to recommend
a word-processing package that I might find useful.  I
was particularly interested in one that would allow me
to designate a variety of typestyles during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">keyboarding</TIMEX>,
ideally one that showed the styles on the monitor
as the text was being typed.  That is called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WYSIWYG</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pronounced ‚Äúwizzywig,‚Äù</ENAMEX> for `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">What You See Is What</ENAMEX>
You Get,' in other words when you designate text to
print in boldface or italic type, it appears in boldface
or italic type on the screen.  For those who are
unfamiliar with computers and the need for a word-processing
package, I should explain (with what I
hope is merciful brevity) that when you buy what is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fondly</ENAMEX> called a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúpersonal‚Äù</ENAMEX> computer, you get three
pieces of equipment (though they may be combined in
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> or makes): a rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> with some
slots in the front and sockets in the back, which is the
computer; a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monitor</ENAMEX>, which is a small TV set without
the usual buttons; and a keyboard, which looks like an
ordinary typewriter keyboard but, in many models
sold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, has a number of additional keys alongside
those for the familiar alphanumeric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>.  On
mine, nestled among some control keys on the right
side is what is called a ‚Äúnumber pad,‚Äù which resembles
the key arrangement one sees on an adding machine or
calculator; on the left side is a double <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> keys
marked F1 through F10 which, when pressed alone or
in combination with another key, perform certain
functions, some of which are useful, others of which
are evidently thought useful by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> but
which I never use.

            These boxes come with wires (called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúcables‚Äù</ENAMEX> in
the trade because that sounds more impressive) that
allow them to be connected to one another and into a
power <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.  The trick is that they will not do anything
unless and until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disk Operating System</ENAMEX>,
which comes with the machine, is installed.  After
that, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOS</ENAMEX>, as it is called, performs certain functions,
though seldom any that anyone but a computer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> would want to perform.  In order to do something
useful, you have to buy a program, which is a
package consisting of a number of diskettes and a manual.
A diskette is also called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúfloppy‚Äù</ENAMEX>; the reason for
the name is not immediately apparent (nor why the
item is called a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúdiskette,‚Äù</ENAMEX> for that matter), but all
becomes clear.  The so-called diskette is a flat black
square sealed envelope of rather tough plastic with a
hole in the middle and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an oblong</TIMEX> slot on each of the
flat sides; it is said to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5¬º inches square</NUMEX>, but that is
a lie: as the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who probably ever measured
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these things, I can tell you it is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 3/16 inches</NUMEX>
square; that may seem irrelevant, but it is only the
beginning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Great Deception</ENAMEX>.  Inside this square
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic casing</ENAMEX> (which you should never open) is a
flimsy flat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">black plastic papadum</ENAMEX>.  If the diskette is
placed in the slot of the machine, a motor engages the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> of the disk inside and spins it around at a great
speed so that portions of it are exposed through its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oblong</ENAMEX> slot, allowing them to be ‚Äúread‚Äù by some device
inside the box.  The diskettes that contain programs
have information on them that the computer ‚Äúunderstands‚Äù
and translates into a number of commands
that make the machine do certain things.  The things
done depend on what kind of program is on the diskette.

            
I bought a word-processing program called
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FRAMEWORK</ENAMEX> II.  It is quite versatile and, as I required,
allows me to create certain kinds of files in which I am
able to style the text as I wish.  (In case you are interested,
it allows me to mark text in any of the following
styles, which appear on the monitor screen in a close
approximation: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">roman</ENAMEX>, bold roman , underlined <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">roman</ENAMEX>,
underlined bold roman , italic , bold italic , underlined
italic , and underlined bold italic .  I acknowledge
that no self-respecting typographer would ever have
anything to do with underlined italic, underlined bold
italic, or some of the other styles described, but you
have to remember that those are merely regarded (by
me, at least) as a means for discretely coding styles
that I do want--like small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX>--that are not provided
by the program.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FRAMEWORK II</ENAMEX> is sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ashton-Tate</ENAMEX>, a silicon-valley
concern that makes quite good programs but,
like most of the software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, produces such
abominable manuals with directions for using the programs
that they have to maintain a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of several
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dozen ‚Äútechnical</ENAMEX> personnel‚Äù who are on duty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 12</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours a day</TIMEX>, beginning at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about six in the morning</TIMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> time) merely in order to answer the questions
of confused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>.  This failing appears to be
epidemic throughout the industry: I recently spoke
with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Okidata</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> of a very
good computer (laser) printer, who told me that his
technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> answers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60,000</NUMEX> telephone queries a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX>.  I pointed out to him that if he made available
a proper manual he could probably reduce the calls by
a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>.  Only the telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is profiting
from such ineptitude.

            But the foregoing is all preliminary and background
to the main theme.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> performed
by <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FRAMEWORK II</ENAMEX> is in a program subroutine
called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the Spelling Checker</ENAMEX>.  I do not need a spelling
checker, but I have found it extremely useful as a
means for proofreading text that has been keyboarded
and stored.  The way it works is this: after completing
an article, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, or what-have-you, you press a few
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">keys</ENAMEX> and the program automatically scans every word
of text, comparing each with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúdictionary‚Äù</ENAMEX> contained
in the program.  It is not really a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>, of course,
because it lacks definitions; it is merely a word list.  You
cannot display the entire word list to examine it, but,
from the directory of programs I can invoke on the
monitor, I know it contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 223,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>,
or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 37,000</NUMEX> words.  Being a computer, the machine
performs this comparison checking very, very rapidly:
it takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a minute</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúproofread‚Äù a file containing
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 7,000</NUMEX> words.  If it encounters a word that is not
in its repertoire, it offers a choice of actions: at the
stroke of a key or two you can ADD the word to the list;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GO</ENAMEX> ON and ignore the word entirely; or EDIT the questionable
item (by correcting a typo, for instance).
There is another option called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SUGGEST</ENAMEX>, which, if invoked,
lists up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> words that you might
have had in mind when you wrote the one that offended
the machine, and this brings me to the point of
this article.

            It seems unnecessary to point out that FRAMEWORK
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> cannot have a very sophisticated list of words if it has
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 37,000</NUMEX> in its memory, but I thought it might be
interesting to see what suggestions it might make as
substitutions for the words it ‚Äúdisliked.‚Äù  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each</TIMEX> listing
below, the boldface word is the word that FRAMEWORK
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúdisliked‚Äù</ENAMEX>; the words following are the substitutions it
suggested.  Where ellipses occur, I have not bothered to
copy down the entire list of offerings, selecting only
those that struck me as odd, either because of the
incongruity of the choice or because I could not, in my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wildest</ENAMEX> flights of dyslexic, schizophrenic fancy, imagine
the criteria employed in arriving at the selections.  I
am fully aware that some of the words in my text are
not everyday items you find about the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, but I
included those anyway; your attention is drawn, particularly,
to the suggestions for the more common
words.

            ...Well you get the idea.  I had some fun substituting
the program's words in my sentences and in simple
sentences, too.  For instance,


All arachnids and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> are arthritic.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> are developing an interstate
rocket that will take <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 light-years</NUMEX> to complete
its journey.

They removed his formicary appendix.  (No wonder
he acted as if he had <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ants</ENAMEX> in his pants!)

Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are unimaginable at the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>.
Why is she still breathtaking when her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is
already <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>!

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie Shoemaker</ENAMEX> devoted his life to resurfacing.

(A statement applicable more accurately to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elvis</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Presley</ENAMEX>.)

The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX> was unmentionable when the verdict
was read out.

I certainly do enjoy some bordellos or beauties with
my steak.

            

            As if the preceding were not enough, I also noticed,
assuming that the program did not stop and
offer choices if the word was in its memory, that oligopsony
is in, but psychoneurotic is not; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Winston</ENAMEX> is in,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Churchill</ENAMEX> is not; isosceles is in, scalene is not.

            It is a good thing that the technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ashton-Tate</ENAMEX>
is not being asked to field questions about its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spelling Checker</ENAMEX>; I am not sure I would want to hear
the answers.

            The preceding may be considered as an introduction
to a review of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Electronic Thesaurus</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proximity Technology, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$</NUMEX>??.  (I seem to have
lost the information about the price but recall it was
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $100</NUMEX>.)  This software consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> disks, one
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">labeled Installation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Program</ENAMEX>, the other Synonym
Linguibase, and a manual.  The manual sets forth
everything with clarity, and the program is simple to
install, requiring <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a few minutes</TIMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> thing
made me a little suspicious when cranking up the system:
in the descriptive text that appears on the screen,
the word labeled is spelt <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúlabelled‚Äù</ENAMEX>--decidedly unAmerican.
However, I went ahead, and, since I was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">typing</ENAMEX>--Oops! <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">keyboarding</ENAMEX> is the word nowadays;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">typing</ENAMEX> is out--the text you are reading, returned to
the beginning of the paragraph to see how some of
these words would fare.  I looked up the word preceding
and was, after a brief moment, asked to type in the
word, which I did.  The screen bloomed forth with the
following:


Query: preceding
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) adj being before especially in time or arrangement

            

            There were also some other parts of speech: one
definition for the preposition and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> for the verb
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">participial</NUMEX>) senses.  I called up the synonyms for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adj</ENAMEX> and the following appeared:


Synonyms:
antecedent, anterior, foregoing, former, past,
precedent, previous, prior
            

            The way the program works is this: one uses the cursor
to highlight a particular word for which synonyms are
desired.  It is similar, in principle, to finding a synonym
in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">synonym dictionary</ENAMEX> and then successively looking
up its synonyms to find their synonyms.  I am not sure
why, but I expected the program to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúnetwork‚Äù in the
same way.  However, when I highlighted antecedent ,
what appeared on the screen was the same list of synonyms
but with antecedent missing; but preceding had
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reappeared</ENAMEX>.  If all this is too complicated to follow, let
me summarize: you look up word <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> and get synonyms,
A, B, C, D, E, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G.</ENAMEX>  You look up the synonyms for
word A, and you get synonyms <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>, B, C, D, E, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.</ENAMEX>  Even the definition provided for the sub-listings is
identical in wording to that of the word originally
sought.

            This is very economical of space and involves a
clever computer ploy, but it does not provide a particularly
useful synonym dictionary, for, as we all know,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synonymy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> does not yield to the mathematical
law that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄúThings equal to the same thing
are equal to each other.<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äù  Perhaps the Proximity people</ENAMEX>
thought that they had got round that little problem by
giving the same definition for each of the items in the
list; but we know that only very rarely are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> synonyms
bi-unique (which is another way of saying that
just because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredient</ENAMEX> means `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituent</ENAMEX>,' not all
meanings of constituent mean `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredient</ENAMEX>,' an ineluctable
fact of language).

            If a relatively limited access to a synonym dictionary
is likely to be of use, then this package may be of
service.  It works with a hard disk or with a set of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">floppies</ENAMEX> and can be used with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> popular word-processing
programs.  (That was the number listed
when I received my copy; it might have increased.)  It
also has a few neat features, like suggesting a few
alternatives if you happen to think that preceding is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spelt ‚Äúpreceeding‚Äù</ENAMEX> (as some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do).  It has a useful
‚ÄúHelp‚Äù feature that can be called upon at any stage.
Also, if you enter jump , you get the synonyms for that;
but if you entered jumped , you get the (same) synonyms
but inflected--including the variants leapt ,
leaped for leap .  All in all, for a primitive system, it is
not too bad; but you would have to be in love with
your computer to use it in preference to the far more
complete books of synonyms available (especially The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synonym Finder , Rodale</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman</ENAMEX> elsewhere, which offers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 800,000</NUMEX>
synonyms, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than three</NUMEX> times the number listed in
any other synonym book).

            The blurb on this book/disk package reads, ‚ÄúSupplies
you with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">470,000</NUMEX> true synonyms for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40,000</NUMEX>
entries.‚Äù  My guess is that such a quantity might be
reached if one counted all the permutations and combinations;
in reality, though, there are probably far
fewer actual words.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> can <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> for themselves
the validity of this numerical legerdemain.

the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bull</ENAMEX> .  At the same time,
the big brains came up with the slogan To business

for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasons: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bull</ENAMEX> is an almost-polite

<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bull</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bull</ENAMEX> !) as a retort means `bullshit;

you said [like, ‚ÄúI have a business problem‚Äù] is a lot

            <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">About ¬•50,000</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>' money is being
spent on a court case which has been brought in the
Court of Appeal by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX>, Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick</ENAMEX>
Mayhew, to determine what the word obtained
means in the context of the insider dealing laws.
         
         
            The case is vital to the offence of insider dealing.
It results from the acquittal of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Fisher</ENAMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX>, on charges of insider dealing, after a
ruling in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwark Crown Court</ENAMEX> which threatens
to severely restrict the scope for prosecutions of insider
dealing.

            Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX> had been charged with insider dealing
in shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson T Line</ENAMEX> just before a takeover
bid for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.  He had claimed to be interested
in bidding for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kleinwort</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benson</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s merchant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, told him out
of courtesy that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had accepted another
offer.  He immediately bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> shares himself,
ultimately netting a profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¬•3,000</NUMEX>.

            
However, he was saved--and acquitted of insider
dealing--by the dictionary definition of the
word obtained.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Butler</ENAMEX> said that Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX> had not actually obtained price sensitive information
in the sense of actively seeking or procuring
it.  He had merely received it.

            He ruled that the proper meaning of the word
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Companies Securities</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Insider Dealing</ENAMEX>) Act
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX> connoted active conduct in the sense of seeking
out information.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> argued in court yesterday
that the word obtained ‚Äúembraces both the active
and passive usage.‚Äù

            ‚ÄúDictionary definitions are not always helpful to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, and slavish adherence to these should be
avoided if the result is to frustrate the intention of
the legislation,‚Äù he said.

            He submitted that the wider construction of the
word obtained gives ‚Äúproper effect to the statute.‚Äù

[<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>] of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1989</TIMEX>, is illustrated by a photograph

            Shouldn't that be ‚Äúmeanings?‚Äù The centered
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">dots</ENAMEX> mark hyphenation points; the standard calls for
a dot between the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">n and the a</ENAMEX>, not the o and the n.
Little confidence is inspired by the presence of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> errors (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> appearing twice) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 12</NUMEX> words
of information.  As the contrivance is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>, it is
sold in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> with a card that shows the ‚Äúcorrect
Queen's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">English‚Äù</ENAMEX> where spellings differ.  No comment
is made about differences in hyphenation that
result from differences or variants in pronunciation.
For instance, if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brit</ENAMEX> pronounces the word (as many
do) conTROVersy, then the hyphen ought to come
after the v, not as in standard <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> in early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>,
fore the v.  At rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> in early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">¬•200</ENAMEX> is equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$355</NUMEX>, which seems a lot to
spend, in pounds or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars</NUMEX>, to get it wrong.

            Has your name haunted you and convulsed others
since you were a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>?  Was it nearly impossible
for you to have a peaceful elementary
school experience?  Could you barely wait until you
were old enough to use your <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and your middle
name?  Have you never told your middle name to
anyone (except the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">school</ENAMEX>)?  Were you
stuck with a family name that the dog wouldn't even
answer to?

            On the other hand, has your name always been
plain, generic, and no-frills?  Do you fail to lift a bureaucratic
eyebrow at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motor Vehicle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>?
Have you contemplated marriage only because you
get to change your name?

            There are those who suffer with names and
those who don't, and, personally, I have always
thought the sufferers have the better time of it.  They
are usually the center of attention at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> and at
conferences their name tags positively glow with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX>.  Who remembers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Smith</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jayne</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smyth</ENAMEX> can warm collective cockles on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any day</TIMEX> of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>.  Since I have been a nonsufferer with a truly
dull name (not even marriage made a difference),
I've become a collector of offbeat names, a genuine,
green-eyed, envious Name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Maniac</ENAMEX>.  Names became
significant to me at an early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>.  It was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> I
discovered that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pansy Euphonia Ubrecht</ENAMEX> resided in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX> next to mine at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> camp.  I listened in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fascination</ENAMEX> as each camp <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counselor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vied</ENAMEX> to involve her in extra roll calls.  Pansy
couldn't understand why her name was music to my
ears when she simply despised it.  I was oblivious to
her moans of disgust.  All I wanted was to follow her
everywhere to listen to others say her name.  Coming
from a staunchly conservative, two-syllable past,
I longed desperately for such melody in my life.  Her
name ran through my thoughts at random moments
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four months</TIMEX>.  My destiny was quietly locked into
place: look forever for other names of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pansy</ENAMEX> Euphonia
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ilk</ENAMEX> .

            Accordingly, I've kept a name list for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>--
great reading for anyone with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX> of
spare time.  After all, names are not just read: they
must be savored, rolled about on the tongue.  Since
the original list is so long, I've extracted a select
number of names in the health professions only, as
listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> that have passed over my
desk--a tribute to my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX>, a famous medical
publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>.  These are names that catch the eye
and the ear, and make beautiful music of their own.
Some are unusual, incongruous, gross, strange-look-ing,
downright odd, and some depend solely upon
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">juxtaposition</ENAMEX>.  Most can be categorized; others must
stand alone.  As for pronunciation, just say it the way
you see it.  However, whatever, these are real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>,
every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.

            It was in a hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>, on my first night
of a visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>, that I was given some advice
on how to communicate with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>.  My volunteer
tutor, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears company</ENAMEX>,
explained that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> have a ‚Äúbeat-about-the-bush‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> of saying things, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> always
go straight to the point.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, he assured
me, I would hear ‚ÄúEnglish with its sleeves rolled-up.‚Äù
Jet-lagged after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten hours</TIMEX> in the custody of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> airline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, I could neither believe nor
argue.

            Back here in rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Herefordshire</ENAMEX>, after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">States</ENAMEX>, I've had time to reflect on what
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> said.  Did he have a point?  Well, I do say
taken to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> rather than hospitalized , even
though the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> term is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> syllables shorter.  I
would never write All thru the nite just to save <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four</NUMEX>
letters.  And I still remember being baffled by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
news story in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.A. Today</ENAMEX> .  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> reported
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Duchess of York</ENAMEX> had been presented with
her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wings</ENAMEX> ‚Äúat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>.‚Äù  I actually
checked the index of my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ordnance Survey</ENAMEX> atlas (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oxenwood...Oxford...Oxhill</ENAMEX>)
before concluding that there was no such place and what they really
meant was ‚Äúat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>.‚Äù  Is it just because
I am <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> that I resent the dropping of a small
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preposition</ENAMEX>?  Do I belong to a race of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fusspots</ENAMEX> who
decorate their sentences with words that don't matter?
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> thought so and he was not
alone.  His belief turned out to be so widely held in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> that it was almost beyond question.

            Let us question it now.  <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> of all, think of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
living <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> and remember how each of
them speaks.  Come on...<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dudley</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX>...any other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>.  Are they euphemistic?
Is their diction cluttered with redundant words
and phrases?  Are their sentence <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> so ornate
and pernickety that the meaning is obscured?  Now
think of a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are guilty of those linguistic
sins.  I can guess who they are: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> airline
stewardesses, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX> hostesses,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who insist on being referred to as
‚Äúspokespersons‚Äù for social reform.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airline</ENAMEX>-speak and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Pentagonese</ENAMEX>, the idea
seems to be to build up the number of words or syllables
in a sentence at the expense of its color, vitality,
and charm.  <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is reduced to a bland, verbal
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porridge</ENAMEX>.  ‚ÄúThe no-smoking signs are illuminated at
this time.‚Äù  The sentence is in the present tense.
There is no need to say at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> (or even now ),
but the rules of airline <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> state that whenever a
stock, useless phrase may be inserted into a sentence
then that phrase must be inserted ( at that moment in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> ).

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> is more extreme but perhaps
more honest.  Its euphemisms are so blatant that no
one could fail to recognize them as anything but
straightforward attempts to deny the truth.  Bombs
are called systems , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poisons</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> .  Then there is
the marvelously uninformative <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Strategic Defence Initiative</ENAMEX> .
To help maintain the required standards of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blandness</ENAMEX> and inefficiency, the words situation and
located must be used (they would say utilized ) as
often as possible.  Unfortunately, the practices of
military and airline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> are contaminating the language
of the greater public.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> we talk
about the weather.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, it is the weather situation .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, I saw a notice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scotch</ENAMEX>-taped to a
supermarket door: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúThis door is locked, please use
the other door which is located around the corner.‚Äù
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, where everything is supposed to be so
long-winded, the sign would ask simply: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúPlease use
the door round the corner.‚Äù

            New Englanders deserve a special mention.  It is
they, I believe, who are mainly responsible for this
crazy notion that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> have a niminy-piminy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> of expressing themselves.  You know the sort of
thing-- inexpensive instead of cheap; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">R.C.</ENAMEX> instead of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T.P.</ENAMEX> or even bathroom stationary instead of
toilet paper .  They believe it sounds <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> so the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rest of America</ENAMEX> believes it too.  What it really sounds
like is genteel, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian English</ENAMEX>, a style extinct in all
but a few suburban, lower-middle-class areas.  While
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are more or less immune from the
mincing style of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayflower</ENAMEX>'s granddaughters,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pentagonese</ENAMEX> has seriously infected the language of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> trade union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>.  Situation pops up like
acne all over their sentences and at this time has deteriorated
to at this moment in time.  Located has,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mercifully</ENAMEX>, not caught on.

            Even in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, trade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unionists</ENAMEX> are put in the
shade by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sociologese</ENAMEX>; they, in turn,
are outshone by their transatlantic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> community <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are the champion
language-manglers.  In their world, nothing and no
one is ever specifically identified or accurately described.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Doctors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> are lumped together
with gophers and pen-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pushers</ENAMEX> under the blanket
term health professional .  No one over owns <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to</NUMEX>
being the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, or the headmistress, only
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> .  Words that have a richness of meaning
are strenuously avoided in favor of cold, empty
terms that have no resonance.  Thus, biological
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> rather than natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> .  This is not the
straight-to-the-point <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">English</ENAMEX> usage on which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
pride themselves.  This is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> with its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sleeves</ENAMEX> rolled right down around its ankles.  Of
course, to avoid being ‚Äúnegative‚Äù we'd have to call
it ‚ÄúMeaning-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Free Language</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            Is there any hope?  Yes.  The cavalry is coming.
In fact, it is already here.  The battle is on for truth,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clarity</ENAMEX>, and the elegant way.  Just as the staid, old
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British English</ENAMEX> was rejuvenated after the First World
Was by the injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>, no-nonsense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grittiness</ENAMEX>,
so modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX> is being saved;
this time by the charge of honest and potent street-talk
into the flim-flam and flummery of the body linguistic.
Some of the best new words on both sides of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> have come from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.
Mugger for instance.  How ever did we manage without
it?  There is the old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> cutpurse but that
sounds too fancy for its purpose and has none of
the casual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bluntness</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> word.  Then
there's scam, junkie , and copout ; neat, powerful,
armor-piercing words.  And where would we be
without rip-off ?

            The battle would probably be won by now,
were it not for the fact that the truth-dodgers have
managed to lay a false claim to the moral high
ground.  There are, however, encouraging signs that
they may not hold it much longer--even New Englanders
are calling black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> black <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>.
Perhaps it will not be too long before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX>, and every proud <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>, will be able to
welcome the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigner</ENAMEX> to a land where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are

            The most respected mechanic in the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin d'Ard√®che</ENAMEX>, not far from where I live, is
called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Monsieur Salaud</ENAMEX> .  And in another nearby village
the job of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> is held down by the amiable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madame Bordel</ENAMEX> .  Perfectly ordinary-sounding French
names--with the sole drawback that salaud means
`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bastard</ENAMEX>' and bordel means `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothel</ENAMEX>'; and all over
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> these unfortunates have for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> the
bearers of such names as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lacrotte</ENAMEX> `turd,' Vachier
`piss off,' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Connard</ENAMEX> `bloody <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool</ENAMEX>,' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whore</ENAMEX>'--
not to mention such real unprintables like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baize</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ducon</ENAMEX> .

            Having a name in this category is no fun in any
language--I speak from bitter personal experience--but
at least in most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Anglo-Saxon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> effecting
a change poses no great problem.  Not so in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, where names are part of the patrimoine , the
national heritage, and are not to be altered or forsaken
lightly: a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet friend</ENAMEX> had to spend several
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and a lot of money to get a missing s restored
to the official version of his surname, so that now,
instead of being B\acap\tard `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mongrel</ENAMEX>' he's plain old Bastard
and, what's more, is very happy about it.

            But to get back to our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whores, Brothels</ENAMEX> , and so
on.  Some of them felt strongly enough about their
situation to form a pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and now, after a
long struggle, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has caved in: a recent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> officiel lists <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> pages of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are to
be allowed to change their names--when they can
come up with the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> franc (¬±<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$325</NUMEX>) fee.

            It is not, however, a matter of ‚Äúyou pays your
money and you takes your choice.‚Äù  For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">officiel</ENAMEX> also provides the alternative names acceptable
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fifth Republic</ENAMEX>; and if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Putins</ENAMEX> , for
example, do not like ‚ÄúPertin,‚Äù well hard <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>,
they'll just have to stay as they are.  While the
Salauds get a government-guaranteed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hobson</ENAMEX>'s
choice: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúSaland‚</ENAMEX>Äù is going to remind everybody of
that unloved ultra-right <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Algerian War</ENAMEX>
period and God help anybody called <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúAsslot‚Äù</ENAMEX> who
ever gets the urge to travel in the English-speaking
world.

            On the credit side <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX>
can now safely come out of their bunkers: they'll be
known henceforth as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hiler</ENAMEX> and at school their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
may enjoy a peace that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> (and I for
that matter) never knew.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> imagines that the majority of the Cocus
`cuckolds,' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Beaunichons</ENAMEX> `nice tits,' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boccons</ENAMEX> (unprintable
again), and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comrades</ENAMEX> in suffering are going
to take more or less gratefully whatever name
the state cedes them.  But in doing so they are going
to break the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel Tesni√</ENAMEX>®res of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Onomastic Society</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Onomastics</ENAMEX> is basically the science
of worrying about names and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Monsieur Tesni√®res</ENAMEX>--an
appellation, as it happens, regrettably
free of all sexual or scatological interest--is much
exercised by the fact that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three centuries</TIMEX> from now
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97 per cent</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> names will have vanished,
with only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7500</NUMEX> surviving out of the estimated
present stock of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250,000</NUMEX>.

            Up until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> you could call yourself
anything you liked in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> (which makes you
wonder what the ancestors of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bastards</ENAMEX> and
Turds were thinking of), but in these more prosaic
and regulated times a number of ordinary everyday
factors is gradually eroding this part of the patrimoine .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, to the despair of every government
since the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution of 1789</ENAMEX>, are notoriously
good at not having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>, and even then half
the production at any given time are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> who do
not usually pass on their names when they marry.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> are free to pass on their names as much as they
like, but some do not marry while others marry and
remain childless.  Add to this those perverse types
who voluntarily renounce such fine family designations
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cupissol</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arsepiss</ENAMEX>' and the result, according
to an anguished <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Tesni√®res</ENAMEX>, is that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> out of every
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> current surnames disappear in the course of a
single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>.

            Already the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> is top-heavy, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> per
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cent</ENAMEX> of the population sharing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4 per cent</NUMEX> of the
available names.  The twelve commonest names now
embrace <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martins</ENAMEX> --there
are already <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">168,000</NUMEX> of them--heading the list.
Maybe when the crunch comes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">300 years</TIMEX>' time
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martins</ENAMEX> , who by then will in theory be one in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, will start demanding the right to
call themselves <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Brothels or Bloody Fools</ENAMEX> .

            One thing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Tesni√®res</ENAMEX> hasn't reckoned with,
though, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Saxon</ENAMEX> input.  The vogue for first
names such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> (pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEMSS</ENAMEX>) is still far
from its peak, and freedom of movement within the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEC</ENAMEX> means that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">surnames</ENAMEX> are becoming
more and more common here.  Already a quick scan
of the local phone book reveals the presence of the
Broadbents, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coxes, Cockles, Willings, Whitworths</ENAMEX> ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crackenthorpes</ENAMEX> .  Not that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> have a monopoly
when it comes to, as it were, injecting new
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> into the namestream.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> haven't been
wasting their time either.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Friends</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bordeaux</ENAMEX> swear
by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plumber</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick McGarvey</ENAMEX> and
our municipal musical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> is overseen by that genial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organist</ENAMEX>--and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Frenchman</ENAMEX>-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rory Nelson</ENAMEX> .

            Just a little effort on the part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with
names like this--put <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox</ENAMEX> with Willing , for example,
and something has to happen--could take some of
the strain off the neurotically prolific <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martins</ENAMEX>,
Bernards , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petits</ENAMEX> and send a welcome ray of sunshine
into the gloom-filled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> Onomastic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX>.  But on second thoughts, maybe not:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Tesni√</ENAMEX>®res would doubtless see this foreign intrusion
as poor compensation for the loss of his homegrown
Whores, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bastards</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitlers</ENAMEX> .
