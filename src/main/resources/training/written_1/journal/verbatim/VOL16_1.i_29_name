            I saw an ad once in the back of a magazine promising
that if I sent in some money, I could have a star
in the firmament named after me.  For the same low
price I would receive a certificate and a photograph of
the galaxy where my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> was located.  I might even be
able to see that star if I possessed suitable magnifying
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX>.  I was not tempted by the offer, but it did
occur to me that while I would not like to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>,
as a wordsmith I might like to own my own word.

            Is it possible to own your very own word?  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English language</ENAMEX> may belong to all of us, but some of
its words are the property of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> or, in most
cases of lexical ownership, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX>.  I am referring
to the registered trademarks and service marks
protected under federal law from the infringement of
unscrupulous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX>.  Now, I am a language professional,
not a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, so if you
want competent advice in the latter areas you should
supplement the summary of the complex trademark
picture that follows.

            The law of trademarks, which fills <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than two</TIMEX>
volumes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Annotated U.S. Code</ENAMEX> in the local law
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>--the source of the following information--gives
us some guidance as to what words can
and cannot be staked out as private property and what
that notion of privacy really means when it comes to
the use of language.

            For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing, you cannot simply coin a word and
lay claim to it.  You must also sell the goods named by
your trademark or perform services named by your
service mark.  In law, a trademark is a name, logotype,
design, or any combination thereof adopted and used
by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> to identify its goods and distinguish
them from articles sold by others.  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> mark identifies
you as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> of specific services rather than
of vendable articles.  For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> is a trademark,
Fotomat , a service mark.  Your trademark or
service mark may be registered, but you may have
rights to the mark even if you have not registered it,
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> you choose for your mark may be pictorial,
as the bearded representation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Brothers</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cough</ENAMEX>-drop fame, who, as some would have it,
are named, respectively, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade and Mark</ENAMEX>.  But a trademark
may also be a word or a group of words.

            Sounds simple, really.  You come up with a no-nonsense
product designed to remove widgets, patent it,
and market it under the straightforward name Widget
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terminator</ENAMEX>.  Maybe the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Widget Terminator</ENAMEX> does its job
well, finds a niche in the market, and over the years
even makes a little money for you.  Only now your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brother-in-law</ENAMEX> decides he is going to get into the act
and beat your price.  Of course he calls his knock-off the
WidgetBuster, a much snappier moniker, and he packages
the product behind a picture of a widget inside a
barred red circle.  Since his product works differently
from yours, you cannot get him for violating patent
law, so you haul him into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> and sue the pants off
him for infringing on the implied trademark you have
established with your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Widget Terminator</ENAMEX>.

            Keeping it all in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, you get your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benny</ENAMEX>, fresh out of law school and eager for work, to
argue that the public has come to love and trust the
Widget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Terminator</ENAMEX> and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will be confused
and deceived by the similarity of the name of the rival
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WidgetBuster</ENAMEX>.  As a result of this confusion of products,
your reputation will be damaged and your sales hurt.
You ask that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WidgetBuster</ENAMEX> be withdrawn from the
market and that your brother-in-law pay you treble
damages and that he pay your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benny</ENAMEX>, as well.

            Do you think you will win?  That depends on how
well <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benny</ENAMEX> did in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intellectual Property Law</ENAMEX>
course.  The law recognizes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> basic kinds of trademark,
though it allows for a measure of degree in their
definition: a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äústrong trademark‚</ENAMEX>Äù is one used only in a
fictitious or fanciful manner, while a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúweak trademark‚</ENAMEX>Äù
is a meaningful word in common usage that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">doubles</ENAMEX> as a suggestive or descriptive trademark.  Weak
trademarks are more difficult to establish, and they
are entitled to narrower protection than strong ones.
Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother-in-law</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> will argue that you may
have an invention, but its name is not a trademark,
because a trademark cannot be an ordinary word, particularly
a descriptive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, if that word is used in its
ordinary sense.  Both widget and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terminator</ENAMEX> are common
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words--a widget is a `gadget, or gizmo,'
in case you did not know--and they literally describe
the function of the product, which is to remove pesky
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">widgets</ENAMEX>, so you cannot claim them as your own or
prevent others from using them.

            Of course, if you have ever talked to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> you
know that things are never what they appear when it
comes to the law.  There have been trademarks that
were fairly literal, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> ,
which is a trademark of long standing, originally
contained both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> and an extract from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cola nut</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> went out when it was declared a
controlled substance early in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX>.  Interestingly,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> (which is also a registered mark)
once sought to prohibit the marketing of something
called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tacola-Cola</ENAMEX> , as well as any other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX> with the
word <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cola</ENAMEX> in its name.  But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> ruled that because
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cola</ENAMEX> was a common word describing what was in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverage</ENAMEX>, any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cola</ENAMEX> derivatives
could be called a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cola</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX>'s trademark was upheld
against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chero-Cola, Clio-Cola, Coca and Cola</ENAMEX> , and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El-Cola ;</ENAMEX> ruled to be non-infringing were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koke</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dope</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cherry-Cola, Roxa-Cola</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dixie-Cola</ENAMEX> .  As for other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sodas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moxie</ENAMEX> won its case against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noxie</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi-Cola</ENAMEX>
lost against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pep</ENAMEX> , as did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seven-Up</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cheer Up</ENAMEX> .

            On the other hand, if the name of your product is
a common word which is applied in an arbitrary or
fanciful sense, you should be able to claim it as a
trademark.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> have ruled that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cyclone</ENAMEX> , when
naming a fence, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Innocent</ENAMEX> , as a brand of hair
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coloring</ENAMEX> (suggesting, as the ruling noted, ‚Äúthe very
antithesis of innocence‚Äù) are legitimate trademarks;
but while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yellow Pages</ENAMEX> was found to be a trademark
although it is clearly descriptive, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">raisin bran</ENAMEX> and
spearmint were not granted exclusive status.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> are fond of deforming the spelling
of an ordinary word to make it distinctive, for example
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NU</ENAMEX> for new, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KWIK</ENAMEX> for quick , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonz</ENAMEX> for bones (unfortunately,
this last, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> food lacking the so-called
silent e, is frequently mispronounced).  But a clever or
phonetic spelling of a common descriptive word does
not entitle you to own it as a trademark.  Rather, a
common word can become a trademark only if it acquires
a ‚Äúsecondary meaning,‚Äù if, in other words, it is
used so long and so exclusively by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> that it
has come to signal to the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> that the product
in question is made by that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX>, and that
producer alone.  (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> have insisted repeatedly
that to be a trademark, a word or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> must call up
not the product or service but its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, the producer
or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX>.)

            If your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother-in-law</ENAMEX> can afford to wait, time
may be on his side in the battle against widgets.  If you
stop selling a product for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or more years</TIMEX>, you may
lose the right to its trademark.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> frown on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> who pretend to sell a few samples of a
product <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> just to hold on to the name for
future use.  But you may be able to withhold the product
from the market while you experiment with ways
to improve it, and you can change the product significantly
and still retain possession of its name, as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tabasco</ENAMEX> did when they altered the formula
of their hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> but successfully defended their right
to exclusive use of the trademark.

            Under the former trademark law, shredded wheat
was considered a generic term and, hence, not registrable.
But because the process for making it was patented,
no other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> could produce it, hence the
patent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX> had exclusive rights to the name of a
unique product.  When the patent expired, new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX>
simply used shredded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX> as a descriptive
term.  And although dictionary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noah Webster</ENAMEX>
was instrumental in passing our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> federal copyright
laws to protect an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s intellectual property, the
name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> ceased to function as an exclusive trademark
when the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s copyright ran out.
As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early as 1904</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. & C. Merriam</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Springfield</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, who claimed to be the literal publishing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noah Webster</ENAMEX>'s lexicographical
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX>, attempted to restrain the sale of other dictionaries
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> in the title.  In a series of decisions-- Merriam
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v. Ogilvie</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F 167</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merriam V.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saalfield</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F 927; 198 F 369</ENAMEX>)--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Circuit</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> ruled partly for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merriam</ENAMEX>, partly for
the competition: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merriam</ENAMEX> lost its right to the exclusive
use of the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> , but since that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had
become known to the public as the publisher of Noah
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s dictionaries, would-be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Websters</ENAMEX> were ordered
to disclaim on their title pages any connection
with the original word book.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1940s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World</ENAMEX>
Publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Company</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s New
World dictionaries, obtained a ruling to quash the disclaimer
requirement.  In a more recent action, initiated
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merriam</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> again
affirmed the right of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> to use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> in
dictionary titles and enjoined the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> from
using any variation or combination of the words
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">world-famous</ENAMEX>, authentic, original, genuine , or renowned
to suggest a connection between their product
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Merriam-Webster</ENAMEX> line of dictionaries (Merriam
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">v. Webster Dictionary Co .</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">639</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F 2d 29</ENAMEX>).  It is clear
that for many, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster's</ENAMEX> has become a generic word.
Despite the fact that this synonymy is one that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> have repeatedly upheld, no dictionary is willing
to define <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s simply as `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>.'

            Normally, a title cannot function as a trademark,
which is why different books can have the same title,
as long as their contents are different and there is no
intent to deceive the public.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> may
be allowed access to the same trademark if their products
are so different that their markets will not overlap
and if there is no indication that the public will be
confused by the names.  Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√©-Nast</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vogue</ENAMEX> , which is a trademark, were
unsuccessful in a suit to force the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vogue</ENAMEX>
School of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fashion Modeling</ENAMEX> to change its name.  And
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>, the language <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX>, registered as a
trademark in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>, failed in its suit against the manufacturer
of Verbatim floppy disks, introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>,
though the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verbatim</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disk</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> agreed never to
produce anything but blank recording <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, while
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> is enjoined only from producing blank media.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of the popular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX> movie title
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ghostbusters</ENAMEX> have extended the range of their trademark
with a television show, toys, and other licensed
products bearing its name and distinctive logo, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX>, the language <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX>, is free to do likewise.

            Ironically, success can sometimes weaken your
right to a trademark, particularly if your product
name has become a generic term.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cellophane</ENAMEX> failed to
protect itself in an infringement suit when the defense
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cellophane</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> for the
generic name of the product.  Unable to come up with
a synonym for cellophane, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> lost its
trademark.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celluloid</ENAMEX> remained a trademark much
longer, though it too has now become a generic term.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zipper</ENAMEX> were both originally trademarks.
But both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> became so popular that
their names began to function as generics in the public
mind, and because of that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> have ruled that
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> could use these words, uncapitalized,
so long as they did not attempt to confuse or deceive
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>.  However, a design or distinctive style of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">typography</ENAMEX> can be a trademark, and the distinctive
manner of printing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thermos</ENAMEX> as a symbol remains
protected.

            Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">law</ENAMEX> regulates only in the broadest sense
what words can or cannot serve as trademarks.  Prior
decisions have little value in trademark claims, and
each case must be argued on its own merits.  As a
result, trademark rulings may seem idiosyncratic or
contradictory.  The law clearly specifies, though, that a
trademark cannot be immoral, deceptive, scandalous,
or disparaging.  Glass <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wax</ENAMEX> , a glass cleaner which contains
no wax, successfully defended its trademark
against a charge that the name was deceptive, but in
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1900s</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> refused to recognize <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX>
as a trademark for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> because it was ruled
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scandalous</ENAMEX>.  (The soft drink <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Monk</ENAMEX> , which was not
perceived to threaten public morality, was permitted.)
Tastes change of course, in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> as well as scandals,
and though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Monk</ENAMEX> is gone from the shelves, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> seem not to be offended by the brand of wine
known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Nun</ENAMEX> .

            Foreign words can serve as trademarks in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>, but their legal status is determined the
same way as that of English words.  Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selchow</ENAMEX> &
Righter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> of the game <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parcheesi</ENAMEX> , could not prohibit
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> from selling games under
such names as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pachisi, Parchisi</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parchesi</ENAMEX> , variant
spellings of the common <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hindi</ENAMEX> word for the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pastime</ENAMEX>.  Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duncan</ENAMEX> was unable to retain exclusive
rights to the name yo-yo because the toy is called
that in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX>, where it originated, and because
it has no synonyms.  On the other hand, both
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scrabble and Monopoly</ENAMEX> are trademarks for games.  Despite
the fact that both are ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> words,
they meet the secondary meaning test, being easily
recognized as exclusive product names, although the
court also upheld the trademark rights of a game
called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anti-Monopoly</ENAMEX> over the objection of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monopoly</ENAMEX>-
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parker Brothers</ENAMEX>.  That decision remains
confused.

            A trademark can be longer than a word, or even a
pair of words.  You can lay claim to an entire slogan if
it has become widely enough identified with your
product, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> do not let you monopolize the
language.  They will limit your power to control sentences
similar to yours, just as they stymied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anheuser-Busch</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of the slogan, ‚ÄúWhere there's life,
there's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bud</ENAMEX>,‚Äù who failed in their attempt to prevent use
of all slogans beginning, ‚ÄúWhere there's life...‚Äù including,
as far as I know, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age-old</TIMEX> proverb, ‚ÄúWhere
there's life, there's hope.‚Äù

            At any rate, it seems that where there's a trademark,
there's hope for a lawsuit.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox Corporation</ENAMEX>,
recognizing the potential danger of success, has
in the past gone out of its way to protect its right to the
words it owns.  Though I have found no reference to
any trademark suits brought by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox</ENAMEX> against other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> has tried to regulate the
use of its trademark in ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>.  For example,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years ago</TIMEX> the xerography <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pioneer</ENAMEX> took out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-page
ads in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> to remind us that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox</ENAMEX> is a trademark to be used only as a proper noun,
as in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox</ENAMEX> machine , or a proper adjective, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox</ENAMEX>
copy .  In either case, warned the ad, we must capitalize
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox</ENAMEX> .  Despite such entreaties, the word xerox seems
to have become generic, if not according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>,
then at least according to current <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> usage,
where it occurs freely as noun, adjective, and even
verb, with or without capitalization.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox</ENAMEX> persists
because unregulated use by others may cause a trademark
to be deemed abandoned.

            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>, either fearing litigation or simply
because they are sensitive to questions of ownership
of the printed word, prefer to take a cautions approach
to trademarks, capitalizing words like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Formica</ENAMEX> in print, though <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> major dictionary
recognizes the uncapitalized form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xerox</ENAMEX> ,
and allows it to function as a verb.  But no contemporary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lexicon</ENAMEX>, either desk-sized or unabridged, records
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s the commonly-found meaning `an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX>, even one not actually attributable to
the lexicographer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noah Webster</ENAMEX>.'

            But back to the hypothetical case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Widget Remover</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mfg. Co. of North America</ENAMEX> v. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">WidgetBuster</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S.A</ENAMEX> .  While you may not be able to restrain your
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brother-in-law</ENAMEX>'s trade, you can hope that his market
share will become so large as to draw the attention of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ghostbusters</ENAMEX> trademark and that
their battery of high-priced studio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> might be
able to get the injunction that your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> could not.

            Clearly, owning a trademark can be worth so
much that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> will object willy-nilly to
any and every use of it by another.  In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case the
court told a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> that there can be no monopoly
on love : <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúNo one may preempt the field with
respect to marks having `love' as a portion thereof and
thus exclude all others from the use of any mark composed
in part of such word.‚Äù  But owning a word can do
little for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> like me, except perhaps in the ego
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>, since according to the law, a word can be
a trademark only if such status does not deprive others
of their right to the normal use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language.
So if you were planning to give someone a word
for his birthday, think again.  Words that do not fit
cannot be returned.  And owning a word is not like
owning a ball: even if the game is not going the way
you planned, you cannot just pick up your word and
go <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX>.

            THE STRANGE CASE OF <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DOCTOR</ENAMEX> ROTCOD



            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are destined for greatness, some for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mediocrity</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otto Rotcod</ENAMEX> was born to become the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palindrome</ENAMEX> made flesh.

            The date of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rotcod</ENAMEX>'s nativity was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 3</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</TIMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/3/39</NUMEX>, an arrangement of figures that read the
same left to right and right to left--in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Danbury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hampshire</ENAMEX>, the only area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> with a self-reflecting
zip code--03230.  His palindromic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX>,
and palindromic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ava</ENAMEX>, named their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tot</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otto</ENAMEX>.

            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rotcod</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> in junior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">high school</ENAMEX>,
he wrote a history paper on the career of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W.</ENAMEX>
Goethals, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> who masterminded the
building of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Panama Canal</ENAMEX>.  At the end of his report,
young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otto summarized Goethals</ENAMEX>' achievement
by writing: A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>!  A plan!  A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX>!  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX>!  Rotcod
surveyed his sentence with considerable pride, and discovered
that the statement was a palindrome, causing
him to exclaim: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äú ` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A man</ENAMEX>!  A plan!  A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX>!  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX>!'
sides reversed is `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A man</ENAMEX>!  A plan!  A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX>!  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX>!‚Äù'
On a hunch, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rotcod</ENAMEX> wrote down that exclamation and
saw that it too was palindromic.  At that epiphanous
moment of fearful symmetry, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rotcod</ENAMEX> became a lifelong
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cainamaniac</ENAMEX>--a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ciloholic</ENAMEX> who spoke and wrote only in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palindromes</ENAMEX>.  ‚ÄúAh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ha!‚</NUMEX>Äù he yelled.  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Years later</TIMEX>, Rotcod
became a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> to realize the unfulfilled potential of
his surname.  Naturally he married a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> called
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannah</ENAMEX>, and from their marriage issued <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> well-balanced
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lil</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nan</ENAMEX>.

            Having heard about this strange case of linguistic
behavior, I visited the good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and
conducted an interview.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LEDERER</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rotcod</ENAMEX>, I'll begin by asking you
about your preferences in life?  Whom
do you prefer, your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX>, or your
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ava</ENAMEX>?

            ROTCOD: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa</ENAMEX>'s a sap .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: So you like your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> better?

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ma</ENAMEX> is as selfless as I am .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: What about your choice between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi</ENAMEX>?

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi</ENAMEX> is pep .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>?

            R: A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> .

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Civic</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Is golf your favorite sport?

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golf</ENAMEX>?  No sir!  Prefer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>-flog .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Which do you like better, math or science?

            R: I prefer pi .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Odd</ENAMEX> or even numbers?

            R: Never odd or even .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Would you rather go to a movie or stay home
and watch TV?

            R: Same nice cinemas .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: I'd like to explore your political preferences.
What did you do <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past November</TIMEX>?

            R: Rise to vote, sir .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: And whom did you want to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>?

            R: Name now <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: All right.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Dukakis</ENAMEX>.

            R: Tut-tut.  Star comedy by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>.  Tut-tut .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Then you voted for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX>?

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, yeh .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Let's move on to your career in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>.  What
would you do first for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> who came to
you with inflammed gums?

            R: Draw <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupil</ENAMEX>'s lip upward .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: And what tranquilizer would you recommend?

            R:  <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Xanax</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: And what do you tell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are sexually
worn out?

            R: Sex at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX> taxes .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Is it true that you apply straw to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">warts</ENAMEX>?

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Straw</ENAMEX>?  No.  Too stupid a fad.  I put soot on
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">warts</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: I understand that you were recently visited by a
hermit with stomach problems.

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recluse</ENAMEX>'s ulcer?
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Yes, what kind of diet did you recommend?

            R: Stressed desserts .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: You emphasized desserts in that diet?

            R: I saw desserts; I'd no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lemons</ENAMEX>, alas, no melon;
distressed was I .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: And it is true that you encouraged the patient
to consume alcoholic beverages?

            R: Yo!  Bottoms up--<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motto</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Boy</ENAMEX>!
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Did you recommend lager or red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX>?

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peel</ENAMEX>'s lager, red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX> did murder regal sleep .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: I understand that, when none of these ideas
worked, you recommended that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> try
to lose weight by fasting.  What did he say?

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúDoc</ENAMEX>, note, I dissent.  A fast never prevents a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fatness</ENAMEX>.  I diet on cod.‚Äù
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doctor Rotcod</ENAMEX>, in addition to your fame in
medical circles, you are well-known for your
passionate hatred of evil.

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evil</ENAMEX> is a name of foeman, as I live .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Then what is your advice to those who seek the
good life?

            R: Live not on evil .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: How can one do that?

            R: Repel evil as a live leper .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Do you then wish to stamp out all lies?

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Live</ENAMEX> on evasions?  No!  I save no evil .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: How should one treat a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liar</ENAMEX>?

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rail</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liar</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Can good and evil exist together in this world?

            R: No, it is opposition .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Did evil always exist?

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>, stone me!  Not so!
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Then where did evil begin?

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">And Adam</ENAMEX>, too?

            R:  <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mad Adam</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: What did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam</ENAMEX> say when he met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX>?

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madam</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eden</ENAMEX>, I'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: And what did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX> say?

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX>, maiden name.  Both sad in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eden</ENAMEX>?  I dash to
be manned.  I am <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Eve</TIMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: What happened when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX> saw that jewel of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">forbidden fruit</ENAMEX>?

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX> saw diamond, erred.  No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maid</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Eve</TIMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: And what happened when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX> offered the fruit
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam</ENAMEX>?

            R: Won't lovers revolt now?
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: So they sinned together?

            R: Named under a ban--a bared, nude <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: And the result was...?

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX> damned <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eden</ENAMEX>, mad <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Eve</TIMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Can we ever escape the influence of that act?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Well, can we?

            R: No, evils live on .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Did you yourself ever sin, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Doctor</ENAMEX>?

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lived</ENAMEX> as a devil .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: How so?

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evil</ENAMEX> did I dwell, lewd I did live .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: And what was the result of that life?

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reviled</ENAMEX> did I live; evil I did deliver .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Apparently, you began to despair of ever overcoming
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evil</ENAMEX>.  What did you think?

            R: Do good's deeds live on?  No, evil's deeds do, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>
God .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: I imagine that this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of affairs made you
quite miserable.

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Egad</ENAMEX>, a base life defiles a bad age .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Did you ever despair that evil could be conquered?

            R: No, it can--action!
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: So you dedicated your life to fighting evil?

            R: Now do I repay a period won .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: And you have fought evil with good?

            R: Did I do, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> God, did I as I said I'd do?  Good, I
did!
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Have you finally won your battle against sin?

            R: Now, sir, a war is won .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: Do you feel good about all this?

            R: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revered</ENAMEX> now I live on.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>, did I do no evil, I
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wonder</ENAMEX>, ever?
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: I understand that your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> in virtue have
no doubts that they will have their reward in
heaven.

            R: Nor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool</ENAMEX>, ah no!  We won halo--of iron!
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: And what will happen to you few who have
seen the light?

            R: Are we not drawn onward, we few, drawn onward
to new era?
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doctor Rotcod</ENAMEX>, I thank you for this two-way
interview.  But how do you do it?  How are you
able to speak in palindromes so skillfully?

            R: Because if I didn't, I'd sound something like
this: <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúsihte kilg niht emos dnuos ditn</ENAMEX> didifie
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suaceb</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
            
         
         
            Another <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Grammatical Game: The Foregone Conclusion</ENAMEX>



            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Foregone Conclusion</ENAMEX> --I claim the capital letters
because I invented it, having beaten <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fowler</ENAMEX>
to it--is one of the trickiest little imps of social intercourse.
Sometimes it is the sneakiest, too.  Its legerdemain
can come close to infiltrating sexual intercourse
as well, you might say, as in the following tricky,
sneaky example:


Do you think a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> should go to his or to her
apartment on a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">date</TIMEX>?  Not many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>, liberated
or not, would fail to see through that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foregone</ENAMEX>
Conclusion, I am sure; who said she should
go to any <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>?

            

            There are far more ingratiating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foregone Conclusions</ENAMEX>
than in such transparent ploys.  How often have
we heard or read statements to the effect that:


It is quicker and cheaper to ride the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> transit
system so why do you drive your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>?

            

            If you start explaining that you are going somewhere
other than home after work or...then you
have fallen into the trap.  To say that it is quicker or
cheaper...may or may not be true.  You should just
be sure that you recognize the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Foregone Conclusion</ENAMEX> .

            Note well, though, that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foregone Conclusion</ENAMEX> is
not the same as a false premise.  They are indeed quite
similar but the difference is that a false premise can
stand on its own: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúIt is essential that the government
run the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post Office</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  ‚ÄúAll</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are the same!‚Äù  ‚ÄúAll
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are the same!‚Äù  (We must give <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy</ENAMEX> and the
colonel equal time.)  And the parenthetical comment is
not intended to be an example of a false premise!  You
see it is the element of persuasion that distinguishes the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foregone Conclusion</ENAMEX> from the false premise.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foregone Conclusions</ENAMEX> are easy to spot once you
know they may be lurking out there in the verbal
jungle.  Let us go hunting.  Look out--here's one!

            Our brand has double the pain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killer</ENAMEX> of brand <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX>

            Conclude carefully here: medically a double dose of
pain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">killer</ENAMEX> does not always kill any more pain than
does a posological dose.


Which dress do you think you prefer then, madam
...?
            

            In the trade I believe they call this a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äútrial closing‚Äù</ENAMEX> and
it can be a powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FC</ENAMEX> --who said she would prefer
any of the dresses?


It is only right that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> making excess profits
should be....
            

            Don't the little (italicized) blighters slip in smoothly?

            All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are created equal....

            And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>?  Equal?  To one another?  They are born
equally strong?  Or of the same color?  Of course, silly
of me, equal under law is what it means.  But laws
differ from place to place, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>.

            I am not trying to make contentious points here
but merely showing how ubiquitous our persuasive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foregone Conclusions</ENAMEX> can be.  How persuasive is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Declaration of Independence</ENAMEX>!

            Word Droppings



            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cannon</ENAMEX> tabulated an attrition rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX> for
new meanings and new items originally admitted
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Merriam Addenda Sections</ENAMEX> which were cumulatively
included in reprints of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Webster's Third New</ENAMEX>
International <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of the English Language</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year</TIMEX> intervals in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966-81</TIMEX> period, but
then were excluded from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merriam</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,000</NUMEX> Words
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>).  Thus a surprisingly high <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98.5%</NUMEX> of the main
entries were retained in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Addenda Sections</ENAMEX> in
question.  These evidently possessed whatever qualities
of viability are required for an item to survive in at
least written <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> once it has experienced adequate
quantity and variety of printed occurrence to justify
initial listing in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place.  Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111</NUMEX> items that
were dropped, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> vanished in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just two to five years</TIMEX>,
suggesting that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early years</TIMEX> of a word's temporary
admission to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> lexicon are the most critical.

            During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this period</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hardcover versions of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Addenda Sections</ENAMEX> were published-- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Words</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>)
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,000</NUMEX> Words .  Now the hardcover version of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7873</TIMEX>-main-entry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Addenda Section</ENAMEX>, appearing simultaneously
as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Words</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>), permits an updating
of the statistics.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 164</NUMEX> previously listed main
entries did not appear in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Addenda Section</ENAMEX>,
some of which had first been listed as long ago as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>,
but a high <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> of which were first listed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX> and so
continue to indicate the critical quality of a new word's
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> in the lexicon.  If we compare these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">164</NUMEX>
deletions to the retained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7873</NUMEX> entries, we find that the
updated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> attrition rate only trivially raises the earlier
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX> rate.  With the thought that word <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> will
be interested in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">164</NUMEX> apparently unviable words,
we will list them below.  Since the word-formation
process by which they came into the vocabulary may
provide crucial information, the list is organized according
to that process.  Thus, we can see at a glance
that, for example, the highest mortality again appeared
in the new noun compounds, where <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX> of
the deletions were noun compounds, whereas the only
variant form was tabbouli .  The deletions consisted of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">134</NUMEX> nouns, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> adjectives, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> verbs, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> affixes.  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taxonomy</ENAMEX> is that determined by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,683</NUMEX>-item corpus
described in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cannon</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>).

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Rudman</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 13, 1987</TIMEX>

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Iran-contra</ENAMEX> hearings drenched us in a stunning
array of colorful words.  For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks</TIMEX>
an august <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of intelligent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> met in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Caucus Room</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX>'s
Office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Building</ENAMEX>.  During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those several weeks</TIMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early summer</TIMEX> the world could listen to articulate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> who have the ability to manipulate
our minds and twist our emotions with word-images.
Through the clever and sometimes masterful use of
language, the same activity or event was made to
sound logical, or patriotic, or it could appear to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sordid</ENAMEX> and bordering on treason.  For example, consider
this clever exchange between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> committee
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Liman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lieutenant Colonel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX>:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liman</ENAMEX>: And, you therefore were told to get rid of
the memoranda that reflected that?

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX>: I was told to clean up the files.
            

            One statement suggests concealing or hiding something;
the other implies good sound bookkeeping, running
a tidy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> wanted to convey the
notion that they were not concerned with language.
Rather, they were only concerned with getting at the
facts.  They wished to bring the message of what actually
happened and show a concerned world that truth
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> would triumph.  Still, for this to happen, all
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> recognized that language was important
to ensure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> would understand acts and
events as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> wished them to be understood.

            During the hearings, we watched unfold before us
a variety of words and phrases to indicate the concept
of not telling the truth.  Seldom did anyone admit to
lying, but statements were often couched in terms colorfully
indicating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> had abandoned verity.
For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Nields, Jr.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>'s
majority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX>, asked, ‚Äú...Are you saying
that he told you to write down a different version of
the facts?‚Äù  And <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">moments</TIMEX> later he continued, ‚ÄúAre you
saying that you decided it was appropriate to put out a
false version of the facts?‚Äù  In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lieutenant Colonel</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX>'s response he used the words a version of the
chronology that was inaccurate .  Later, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nields</ENAMEX> used the
phrase the chronology with the false version in it .  He
then followed with a question, staying with this
stronger phrase false version .  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX>'s response contained
the clause this version of the document was
wrong, intentionally misleading .  Earlier he had used
this version was incorrect .  Once <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nields</ENAMEX> had used false
version , he stayed with that for a while.  Then he used
false story .  This word story presents interesting possibilities.
Used in a straight forward positive sentence, it
carries a favorable connotation: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúWe want to get out
the whole story,‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúCol. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX> will tell his story to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>.‚Äù  But used with words with unfavorable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">connotations</ENAMEX>, it assumes a pernicious meaning of
make-believe, for example, ‚ÄúIs that still his story?‚Äù  or
‚ÄúWhat is his story now?‚Äù

            Other euphemisms for lying that were used included
excessive statements, outright misrepresentation,
dissembled, prudent to change those chronologies ,
and radically different from the facts .  The
concept of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúplausible deniability‚Äù</ENAMEX> is a variation on the
theme of avoiding the recognition or the admission of
lying.  Implicit in the term is the idea that one has
chosen to do something that one may want to deny
later.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> must then consider if such a denial is reasonable,
that is, believable.  If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> denies something, is
it possible that the denial, that is, the lie, could be
exposed?  It might be possible to establish an equation
to determine the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plausible Deniability Factor</ENAMEX> (PDF) of
any statement.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Psychologists</ENAMEX> and social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> could
do a lot with that.

            The deleteriously loaded term elaborate scheme
popped into the hearings with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks</ENAMEX>' words, ‚Äú...this elaborate scheme was to
carry out these activities<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">...‚Äù  In American English</ENAMEX>
scheme strongly implies `craftiness, secret intent';
while not as strong as plot , it certainly lacks the neutral
qualities of plan and conveys a meaning far beyond
its dictionary definition.

            Near the close of the session <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday, July 8th</TIMEX>,
there arose a clever word game after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nields</ENAMEX> characterized
some of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Col.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX>'s responses as several
speeches .  Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brendan Sullivan, Jr.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Col.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX>,
objected to the term, declaring it to be pejorative.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman Senator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Inouye</ENAMEX> said, ‚Äú...some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> consider lengthy statements to be speeches.‚Äù  Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nields</ENAMEX> replied, ‚ÄúI'm perfectly happy to use the expression
`lengthy statements.‚Äù'  And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> came
back with, ‚ÄúHow about using lengthy answer...?‚Äù
Speeches in this context carries with it too much of the
idea of pontificating, which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> did not want.
While statement is better, answer gives the mental picture
of completion.  Someone who knows can give an
answer; we are left with a positive image.  Response
would have been a good neutral word, but neither side
was thinking neturality that late in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX>.

            Another classic example of a loaded word jumped
up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days later</TIMEX> when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liman</ENAMEX> asked a question
that began, ‚ÄúAnd after you became involved, linked
with...‚Äù This word linked is a sneaky little devil.
While it means simply to `couple or connect,' the connotation
is always negative.  No one is linked to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Red Cross</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humane Society</ENAMEX>, but people
may be linked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mafia</ENAMEX>.
When we hear that someone is linked to an organization
or cause of which we have never heard, we feel
ominously that this must be bad.

            Early in the proceedings we saw a cat-and-mouse
game develop over what to call `money that is excess
over expenses in a business transaction.'  Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nields</ENAMEX>
asked, ‚Äú...what did the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> know about the
diversion of the proceeds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> sale to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Contras?‚Äù  North</ENAMEX> responded, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúI</ENAMEX> never personally
discussed the use of the residuals or profits from the
sale....‚Äù  This was one of the few times <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Col.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX>
used profit , choosing to stay with the more charming
residuals , as used here, meaning `remainder.'

            When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nields</ENAMEX> used diversion again, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Col.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX>
responded with ‚ÄúWell, you insist on referring to it as
`diversion.'... my use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>...leads me to believe
that those were `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residuals</ENAMEX>' and not diverted--the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only</NUMEX> thing we did was divert money out...and put it
to better use....<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Nields</ENAMEX> countered with ‚ÄúI'm not
asking about words, now, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Colonel</ENAMEX>.  I'm asking you
whether you didn't continue to send memoranda seeking
approval of diversions or residuals, whatever the
word....‚Äù  While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nields</ENAMEX> seemed uninterested in
words, he, nevertheless, stayed with diversion
throughout the questioning, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North</ENAMEX> continued with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">residuals</ENAMEX>.  Divert means to `change from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> or
use to another or to turn aside.'  In some contexts the
word can connote `secrecy and deception,' a diversion
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tactic</ENAMEX> , for example.  Used in another context, it is perfectly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">harmless</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> of a river, for instance, may be
diverted to prevent flooding.

            The words profit and proceeds are almost equal in
meaning.  When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nields</ENAMEX> used proceeds , he was passing
up a chance to irritate or challenge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX>, for the
connotations are completely different.  It is much better
to refer to the proceeds of a raffle rather than the
profits.  Profit is deeply rooted in the world of business
and too often associated with money-grubbing and
greed.  Later, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jenkins</ENAMEX> referred to a
profit-making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> , which sounds harsher than if
he had chosen to say profit-making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX> .  But
‚Äúproceed-producing enterprise‚Äù would have sounded
even more innocuous.  Shortly after this, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX> used
the terms revenue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> and deserving of fair just
reasonable compensation .  These phrases are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more
synonyms for profit that alter our perception a little.

            As with the myriad words surrounding profit ,
there was a plethora of words surrounding the Boland
Amendment.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Col.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX> used the phrases complying
with those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boland Proscriptions</ENAMEX>, the constraints and
proscriptions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boland</ENAMEX> , and working around the
problem that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boland</ENAMEX> would have created .  Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liman</ENAMEX>
responded to this last phrase with, ‚ÄúWell, another
word for working around, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have had
some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, is `circumvent.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù'  Circumvent</ENAMEX> does mean
to `work around' and implies ingenuity and strategy.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Circumvent</ENAMEX> is much more precise than the term work
around and suggests a planned detour to avoid the
law.  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX>'s statement that he ‚Äúsought a means of complying
with...<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boland‚</ENAMEX>Äù and his work around remark
mean essentially the same, but complying sounds
much nicer, conveying the idea of adhering to regulations.
On the other hand, circumvent suggests avoiding
what is mandatory and at the same time returns a
more formal, legalistic atmosphere to the questioning.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> terms that surfaced during Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liman</ENAMEX>'s questioning
were fall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scapegoat</ENAMEX> , both terms introduced
by him and not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Col.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ninth</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collegiate Dictionary</ENAMEX> tells us that a fall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> is `one
who is easily duped.'  A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> definition reveals it to
be synonymous with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scapegoat</ENAMEX> .  But fall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> is a less
formal term and suggests ignorance.  Many of us recall
the old gangster movies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphrey Bogart</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Cagney</ENAMEX>.  Either <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cagney</ENAMEX> must have
said, <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">‚ÄúYou</ENAMEX> ain't gonna pin this rap on me!  I ain't no
fall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>!‚Äù  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scapegoat</ENAMEX> , on the other hand, means `one
who bears the blame for others'; it is a political word
that carries with it a certain nobility and martyrdom
that fall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> doesn't imply.

            The rich and rewarding, and often necessary,
sport of quibbling over words arose early in the questioning
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Col.</ENAMEX>  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX>, responding to a question
from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nields</ENAMEX>, replied, ‚Äú...the word `investigation'
wasn't used... Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meese</ENAMEX> had been asked to do
a fact-finding inquiry....‚Äù  Later during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attorney</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>'s appearance before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>, those two
words came up often.  Those who tended to be favorable
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colonel</ENAMEX> used inquiry while those distrustful
of him were inclined to use investigation .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meese</ENAMEX> contended
that his actions took just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX>, and investigation
implies a thoroughness that is missing in inquiry.
While some were prone to use the phrase
extensive or complete investigation , others used brief
or informal inquiry .

            Somewhere, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sometime</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> must
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bestow</ENAMEX> upon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brooks</ENAMEX> a special commendation
for his creation of a description of a planned
government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> that would be ‚Äúa more or less off-the-shelf
independent, stand-alone, self-supporting
operation for covert operations.‚Äù  He used a noun, two
prepositional phrases and a string of adjectives that
would make anyone proud.

            So the hearings have come and gone, but the
repercussions will remain for some time.  Our judgments
may hinge on a well-turned phrase, a beautifully
nuanced sentence, a word-image that flashes
across our gray matter reminding us of childhood.  A
position that seemed logical a while ago now becomes
irrational.  A strong conviction is suddenly an indefensible
belief.  Some of us will hold to an idea or concept
regardless of the evidence; others will change positions.
Still others will simply marvel at the use of language
and wonder just where our analytical side ends
and our emotional side begins.  We may never know for
sure if our conclusions are based on cold, hard logic or
pure sentiment.
         
         
            Does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Accent Matter</ENAMEX>?
            This interesting, readable book is probably the
most sensible work on the pronunciation of English
ever published.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honey</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> linguist
now on assignment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bophuthatswana</ENAMEX>, one of the less
easily pronounceable places in the world, writes in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">straightforward</ENAMEX>, simple, casual, friendly style totally
devoid of the off-putting symbols and technical jargon
that usually mark writing on pronunciation.  That is
not to say that the book's theme is casual, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Honey</ENAMEX>
comes to grips with social aspects of language that are
seldom treated, even in a clinical manner, by linguists.
A notable exception in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labov</ENAMEX>; but, despite his open, readable style, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labov</ENAMEX>'s
work is known mainly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX> because it appears
in scholarly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> and in books distributed largely to
the academic market.  For all that, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Does Accent Matter</ENAMEX> ?
is not a whit less scholarly, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faber</ENAMEX> must be
congratulated for perceiving it as a work that deserves
a wider <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readership</ENAMEX>.  The biggest concessions to make
the presentation more palatable for the general reader
is the elimination of footnote references within the
text: even superior numbers do not appear in the text,
and those who demand footnotes must refer to a brief
Appendix where they are arranged, chapter by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>,
with clear page references.  As one who understands
the importance of footnotes but loathes them
because of their continual, unsightly interruption of
normal reading, I applaud this treatment: they are
there if you want them, but they do not intrude.  The
index is quite thin on the ground: after reading such a
book, one naturally puts it aside till it is wanted for
reference to certain points, and the paucity of the index
will make the location of information something of
a chore at a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later date</TIMEX>.  I have always felt that every
book on language should include, either in its index or
in a separate listing, all of the words and word elements
discussed in the text, for they often provide the
point of reference for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honey</ENAMEX> explains the distinction between dialiect
and accent :


If a regional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> also uses the grammer, vocabularly,
and idiom that are distinctive of his region,
then we say he is speaking dialect.  But if he uses the
grammer, vocabularly, and idiom of the standard
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English</ENAMEX> found in newspapers, books, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>, and
news bulletins, then all we notice about his speech is
his accent--and possibly his intonation.

            

            Most of this book is understandably concerned with
accent in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>, though other varieties
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> are discussed.  To better understand attitudes
toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> spoken in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> one must
be familiar with the term Received Pronunciation
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX>), which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> describes as:


The accent most obviously associated with the standard
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> dialect..., [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX>] echoes the rather
old-fashioned sense of `received' as meaning `generally
accepted' as in the terms `received opinion' and
`received wisdom,' especially by those who are
qualified to know.

            

            Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of English worldwide, either as a native
or an acquired language, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> is the most highly
regarded accent--indeed, some might well regard RP
as standing for `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Revealed Pronunciation</ENAMEX>'--so it behooves
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to pay attention to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Professor Honey</ENAMEX>'s comments
about it, favorable and adverse.  The chapter
titles give a good indication of the subject matter
covered:


<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ONE</TIMEX>  What is `an accent'?
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TWO</NUMEX>  Where did RP come from?
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">THREE</NUMEX>  <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Talking</ENAMEX> proper and talking posh
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOUR</ENAMEX>  Are some accents better than others?
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">FIVE</NUMEX>  What is happening to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX>?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIX  Accent</ENAMEX> variety and the mass media
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEVEN</ENAMEX>  The accents of politics
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EIGHT  Changing</ENAMEX> patterns
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NINE  Accents</ENAMEX> and the future

            

            In the course of his treatment of these topics, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> provides a wealth of information that answers
numerous questions (and confronts many of the prejudices)
that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have about language:


Increasing literacy and pressures towards `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correctness</ENAMEX>'
led in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> to spelling-pronunciations
which caused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> to restore a whole range of
sounds which earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> had dropped, like
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">l</ENAMEX> in fault, vault, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX>; the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> w in
awkward and the sole w in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edward</ENAMEX>; the t at the
end of pageant, respect, and strict; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">d</ENAMEX> in
the middle of the word <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> and at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>.  Over the same period <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of the
standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> accent learned to drop the final d
0which for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> had been attached when ordinary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> talked of a scholard and his gownd.

            

            We all know about language prejudice, but it is nonetheless
interesting to read that:


...an RP accent was one of the foremost criteria
for being an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX>.  In Birmingham
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1918</TIMEX> it was possible to buy a manual
designed to enable local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> to correct their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accents</ENAMEX>, since, as its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> claimed, ‚Äúto no one is
the absence of local dialect more important than to
the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> in the army‚Äù.  Carnage at the
front forced that specification to be relaxed in
many cases, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> had to be commissioned
whose voices betrayed their promotion from the
ranks.  When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> inspected the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cadets</ENAMEX>
at a public school (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lancing</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1919</TIMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen-year-old</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evelyn Waugh</ENAMEX> helped to organize the
dropping of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX> as a demonstration against the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">man</ENAMEX>'s accent....

[In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX>] the public-school-educated
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">actor Dirk Bogarde</ENAMEX> (born in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1921</TIMEX>) claims
that in that war the sole reason for his promotion
from the ranks to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> status was his accent.

            

            And we know that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Professor Honey</ENAMEX> has it right when
he writes about


...the tendency, which now pervades the whole
of our society, for us to attach to particular accents
certain generalized assumptions about the values
and attributes considered typical of certain social
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.  In other words, we judge accents by
stereotypes which we already have about their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>....  One <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> has claimed that
non-standard features (grammer and vocabulary as
well as accent) have the power to close off a conversation
among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strangers</ENAMEX>, bring job interviews to an
abrupt end and, when used on the telephone, to
render a flat advertised as vacant <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that morning</TIMEX> suddenly
to be declared <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúalready let‚Äù</ENAMEX>.

            

            A curious aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> was (or is) its continual
shifting: as soon as some of its characteristics are
adopted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of a different social or educational
class, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>, by consent that could
scarcely be tacit, change the rules of the game, coming
up with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shootin</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">huntin</ENAMEX>'.  For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.S. Van Dine</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detective</ENAMEX> novels of the
1930s might have been mystified by the insertion into
the dialogue of its lordly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> expressions like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">don</ENAMEX>'tcher know and the anathematized ain't .


            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> may be pleased (or relieved) to learn
that


The American accent--any <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> accent--can
expect a favourable reception in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
reasons.  First, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> is perceived as standing
outside the social-class hierarchy which partly explains
the scale of evaluation of our own <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> accents.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, we are not able to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX>, on accent
alone, the features of `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">educatedness</ENAMEX>' which might
be apparent to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX>, so we
give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> the benefit of the doubt.  Thirdly,
the American accent is to some extent glamorized
by the film industry and by the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
programmes shown on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> television.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian</ENAMEX>
English accents, which in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> cannot normally
be distinguished from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>, share the
same generally favourable evaluation....  If the
greatest single influence on the current evolution of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English RP</ENAMEX> and of many non-standard accents in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> today is the `popular' <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> accent, it is
also true that the greatest single influence on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grammar</ENAMEX>, vocabulary, and idiom of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as spoken
and written in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX>.

            

            Those who are not intimately familiar, from listening
to them on radio and television, with how specific
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entertainers</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>
since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX> sound may find themselves at sea in the
rather detailed descriptions (chapters <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six and seven</TIMEX>) of
their pronunciations and their effects, good and bad,
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>.  Despite that, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Honey</ENAMEX>'s treatment
is virtually self-explanatory, and anyone contemplating
a work on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> accents would do well to be
guided by the principles he has established.

            Inevitably, there are some slips regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pronunciation</ENAMEX> and accent, most if not all of which
can be charged to the failure to identify specific dialects
or the absence of a restrictive modifier like most
or many to precede <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> .  For example,


<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX> removes the y- from the yu-
sound when it turns new and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duke</ENAMEX> into noo and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dook</ENAMEX>...

            

            That is a pattern characteristic of only certain
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> dialects (as a check in any good modern
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictionary</ENAMEX> would reveal).  The same is true for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Honey</ENAMEX>'s
assumptions about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> , which he implies is universally
pronounced in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX> with the vowel of boot ;
about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> syllable of which is not
always rhymed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX> ; about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX> , which is
pronounced identically to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> (RP) way by
many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>; and about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">-nam of</ENAMEX>
which, contrary to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s information, is pronounced
by many AE <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> to rhyme with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dam</ENAMEX> , not
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">palm</ENAMEX> .  As for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> tend to give both a
sounds the same quality, whether they rhyme them
with that in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> or in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> .  On the other hand, the
pronunciation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> follows either
the pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> , which has the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> syllable and that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> in the last, or, as in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, is heard with the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in both positions.

            Again:


<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> pronounce a strong r in card, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, and
similar contexts...,

            

            an observation that does not apply to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Yorkers</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Englanders</ENAMEX>.  And the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> has been misled to
infer that all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> say deTAIL, baTON, INquiry
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adverTISEment</ENAMEX>, haRASS, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REsearch</ENAMEX>: both occur.
I, for one, say deTAIL, baTON, inQUIry or INquiry
(depending on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>), adVERtisement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HARass</ENAMEX>, and
reSEARCH, which leads me to think that these stress
patterns are not necessarily distributed along dialectal
lines.


...Britons get the impression that large numbers
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> go through their whole lives unable
to make confident distinction between a positive
and a negative statement of possibility, between `I
can do it' and `I can't do it'.

            

            It may not come as much of a revelation to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX>
Honey to learn that even I, a native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX>,
often have to ask whether an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> meant
to say can or can't when the word receives any emphasis;
but in normal, unstressed speech the former is
usually reduced to `k'n' while the latter is of longer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duration</ENAMEX>, even, than that of the noun can .  To be sure,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> practice of rhyming can with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a of</TIMEX>
can't with that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> does neaten things up a bit.

            
               Does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Accent Matter</ENAMEX>?  has a sprinkling of amusing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anecdotes</ENAMEX>, this being one of my favorities:


Around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> political figure was
made the subject of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> radio profile.  The programme
was the more interesting because of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX>'s admirable fluency in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Listeners</ENAMEX>
were diverted to hear him explain, in answer to a
question about his personal life, that his pastimes
included ‚Äúmiddle-aged antics,‚Äù and they must have
wondered what innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">japes</ENAMEX>--or perhaps amorous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frolics</ENAMEX>--the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> got up to, until they
worked out that middle-aged was his very reasonable
attempt at translating du moyen age (medieval),
and that antics was his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gallic</ENAMEX> stress pattern
for `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">antiques'</ENAMEX>.

            

            As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX> sojourning for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past twenty years</TIMEX>, I
have been struck by the creeping changes I have perceived
in the RP pronunciation of some ordinary words
(controversy, disciplinary) and of proper names: news-readers
on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC Radio 4 and World Service</ENAMEX> tend to
stress <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khomeini</ENAMEX> on the last syllable
where formerly one heard it stressed on the sound.

            I had best curb my temptation to reproduce the
entire book here by stopping now, leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> with
a great deal to look forward to.  In the unlikely event
that my message has not come across, allow me to
repeat that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERBATIM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> are sure to find it as
engaging as I did.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Urdang</ENAMEX>
         
         
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longman Register of New Words</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Ayto</ENAMEX> has drawn on a world of English-language
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> for the citations
in this interesting and useful book.  Most of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX>-odd
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> are, quite naturally, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> in origin and persuasion,
with a fair sprinkling of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">periodicals</ENAMEX>; others
looked at include <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> (for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The International</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herald Tribune</ENAMEX> ).  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ayto</ENAMEX> writes well, and his Introduction
(actually, to get fussy about it, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreword or Preface</ENAMEX>)
sets forth clearly the aims and purposes of this
collection of neologisms.  The selection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1200</NUMEX> entries
for inclusion seems a bit esoteric, but the general structure
of the work--entry word, part of speech, definition,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">citation</ENAMEX>(s), and, in many cases, an explanatory
comment on the origin of the term, its etymology, and
other information--is straightforward.

            Rather than skip through, picking up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúshowcase‚Äù
entries throughout the book, I chose to read thoroughly
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first quarter</TIMEX> (A<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-C</NUMEX>) and remark on specific
entries.  I have not commented on entries that are either
entirely satisfactory or out of my ken.


advance man The definition given, `someone who
makes arrangements for visits and appearances
by an eminent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, and goes in advance to
ensure that they proceed smoothly...A word
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> origin.'

            

            This seems too specific to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX>]
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> who associate the designation with the circus
and other entertainments.


amicus brief `<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> a legal submission by someone
who is not party to a case but has an interest
in its outcome...<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amicus</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúfriend</ENAMEX>.‚Äù '

            

            This shortened form may be rare in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British English</ENAMEX>
[BE], but the term amicus curiae , literally `friend
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>,' is well established in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">etymological</ENAMEX> note could be misunderstood.


appeal `noun an act of appealing against something
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Ski Association</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> rejected
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Brown</ENAMEX>'s appeal of his exclusion from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Ski Team</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX>
The..verb appeal..is very well established in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AE</ENAMEX>...Not so widely recorded is the consequence
of this..with the preposition of..
where in BE one would expect against.'

            

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> would expect against in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX> also for this
sense, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">of</ENAMEX> can be attributed to journalese or
some other aberrant style.  Appeal of is used in standard
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX> in: `The appeal of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and kittens is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">universal</ENAMEX>.'


arrestee `<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who has been arrested'

            

            The citation is from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roanoke Times</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World-News</ENAMEX> , undoubtedly a redoubtable newspaper
but scarcely one I should have selected as typifying
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX>.  It sounded like a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonce</ENAMEX> usage to me till I found it
in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Unabridged</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Edition</ENAMEX>
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHDII</ENAMEX>] with a date of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1840-50</TIMEX>.  Notwithstanding, I
should not think it common enough to warrant occupying
space in this book.


autocondimentation `seasoning one's own <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pepper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> at table'
            

            Very likely a facetious coinage, this appeared in
quotation <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">marks</NUMEX> (attributing an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientist</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>.  Like many of the entries,
both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX> and BE-- autohagiography, awfulize, babushkaphobia,
babynap, bimbette , etc.--this strikes
me as a nonce word, not likely to be found around the
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">house.</ENAMEX>


boffo The only speculation about its etymology
cited is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merriam-Webster</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,000</NUMEX> Words: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúfrom</ENAMEX>
boffola, a `belly-laugh,' which in turn comes
from boff, a `belly-laugh,' `gag,' `hit,' perhaps
based on `box office.'‚Äù

            

            I prefer the suggestion in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHDII</ENAMEX> that it might
come from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buffo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> bouffe `comic.'


bump `(of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airline</ENAMEX>) to exclude (a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX> with
a booking) from an overbooked flight'

            

            This might be new to BE but this sense of bump
and, alas, the practice have been common in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX> for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and ought to have been so indicated.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cherry</ENAMEX> pick `verb, informal to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX> off the choicest
items ..  The metaphor of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúcherries‚Äù</ENAMEX> as the
most desirable elements of something may be
reminiscent of the ‚Äúbowl of cherries‚Äù which life is
proverbially not.'

            

            Close, but no cigar.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> as well as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>,
a sweet (like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice cream</ENAMEX>) is often topped with
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">whipped cream</ENAMEX> on which is placed a maraschino
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cherry</ENAMEX>.  Some (younger) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> often save the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cherry</ENAMEX> to
eat last; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> more advanced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> may be seen to
eat the cherry <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, presumably on the theory that they
might not last long enough to finish the sweet.  To
many, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cherry</ENAMEX> is, indeed, the choicest part.  But the
image is colored, too, by the existence, in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX> and
BE, of a type of light, mobile hydraulic crane provided
with a basket or platform enabling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to approach a
tall structure (like an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> ice-cream sundae)
from above to pluck the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cherry</ENAMEX> from the top.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coconut</ENAMEX> or coconut head `noun, derogatory slang a
black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who adopts white cultural characteristics
..  The metaphor is based on the coconut's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brown exterior</ENAMEX> and white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interior</ENAMEX>.'

            

            This is an interesting one: the term in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX> is oreo ,
after the tradename of a dark double chocolate cookie
with white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX> between, a confection not encountered
(by me) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>.


creative `adjective, euphemistic going beyond conventional
scope or legal limits ..  This new meaning
of creative, with its implication of imaginative
rule-bending for possibly disreputable
purposes, appears to have been coined in the
field of accountancy .. , but has since widened
its area of application considerably.'

            

            I should have thought that `innovative' might have
been a better gloss, and one must take account, too,
that it was originally (and still is for those who have
any sensitivity for the word) cynically facetious.

            Aside from these comments, which are intended
to be helpful, there is a great deal of interest to be
found in this book, considerably enhanced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayto</ENAMEX>'s
comments.  For example,


-cred combining form, slang popular acceptance
among the stated group

This form started its career in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid 1980s</TIMEX> in
street-cred, an abbreviation of street credibility
--popular approval in urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working class</ENAMEX> culture--but
now is beginning to show signs of developing
into a buzz-suffix in its own right:

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX>-cred

All these qualities make him [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Imbert</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Police Commissioner</ENAMEX>] a copper's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX>.
He has force-cred, and therefore is as well placed
as anyone could be to make the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newman</ENAMEX> structural
reforms actually work in practice.

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Guardian 18 Mar 1988</ENAMEX>

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayto</ENAMEX>'s style is lively: in his comment on cathart he
offers:


This <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">curiously curt coinage</ENAMEX>, based on cathartic, at
least has the merit of getting out of the usual humdrum
-ize rut.

            

            There are (other) entries whose validity seems questionable
on the grounds that they, like some I have
mentioned, are not likely to have sufficient frequency
in the language to merit inclusion-- aestheticienne, affluenza,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agitpop</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX>] , to mention a few.  The citations
are shown to add explanatory information to the definitions
as well as context, not, as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> , as attempts
at establishing earliest recorded evidence.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compilers</ENAMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>) of such works would be
well advised to have any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX> material thoroughly
checked by those in the know, for it is almost impossible
to derive accurate information about a given dialect
save from those who are steeped in it.

            Settlement was much more rapid in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> than it had been in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, and this has
affected the place-naming patterns.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> people
had time to contemplate the area before settling on an
appropriate name; in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, where settlement
was more rapid, names often had to be chosen
without delay.  This haste has quickened the creative
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">juices</ENAMEX>, and has sometimes resulted in innovative and
intriguing place names.  As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Stewart</ENAMEX> wrote,


In a period of rapid expansion, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">counties</ENAMEX>
were being established <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>...the demand
for names outran the supply, and the result was
both monotony and confusion.

            

            The problem of having to create a large number of
place names in a relatively short period is illustrated in
a true story told by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Wexler</ENAMEX>:


A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">store owner</ENAMEX> [in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>] applied for a postal
listing under the name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excelsior</ENAMEX>, but was turned
down because the title was already claimed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>.
In response, he wrote back saying that any
name would do, as long as it was ‚Äúdifferent and peculiar.‚Äù
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few weeks later</TIMEX>, federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> notified
him that he was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">postmaster</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peculiar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>.
            

            In the confusion of finding a name quickly, practical
problems sometimes emerged.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morrow</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX>,
was <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> named after a state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX>, but this name
had to be changed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morrowville</ENAMEX> ‚Äúbecause of semantic
confusion when juxtaposed with a common preposition.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railroad</ENAMEX> claimed that its ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> were
becoming confused when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> requested tickets
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúto Morrow</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            At the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>, meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
Names <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis McArthur</ENAMEX> recited
a poem about another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moro</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sherman County</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>.  The passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Pacific</ENAMEX>
Railroad in that particular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was named Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bassinger</ENAMEX>,
and an often recited poem in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was:


Oh!  Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bassinger</ENAMEX>
I want to be a passenger
I want to go to Moro
And I want to go <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
Well, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> that goes to Moro
Is now upon its way
And you cannot go to Moro
Any more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Remington</ENAMEX> indicates that on the official
form for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX> name selection there is a blank for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúName of Town‚Äù</ENAMEX> and the directions, ‚ÄúPlease write in
ink.‚Äù  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>
took this information literally as they were voting for
the town name, and so many of them wrote in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúInk</ENAMEX>,‚Äù
that Ink became the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.

            Railroads preceded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> into many parts of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">every few miles</NUMEX> a siding had to be
built so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX> could pull off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> and wait for
others to pass.  Each siding was given a name.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX>
Stupey of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amarillo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, a lifelong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Fe Railway</ENAMEX>, has collected stories which he shares
in a slide-show about the railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sidings</ENAMEX>.  Names were
used because they were easier to remember than numbers.
Frequently a name was chosen on the basis of a
topographical feature, resulting in such names as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bluffdale</ENAMEX> (dale near a bluff), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clifton</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> near a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cliff</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shopton</ENAMEX> near a repair <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coalinga</ENAMEX> near a
coal shed.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> was on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">98th meridian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justin</ENAMEX>
was ‚Äújust inside‚Äù the county line, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haswel</ENAMEX> was at a
place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> that had dry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Stupey</NUMEX> points
out that there were so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sidings</ENAMEX> needing names
that the railroaders were forced to be creative.  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Spanish</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> names were precedents to other non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>-sounding
names.  For example, casual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>
probably think such words as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calgro, Rioca</ENAMEX> , and
Mopeco are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>.  Actually, in an early example of
shrewd public relations, the names were taken from
the names of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shippers</ENAMEX>.  Naming a siding after a company
flattered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and increased its loyalty to
the particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railroad</ENAMEX>.  Calgro was named for ‚ÄúCalifornia
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Growers,‚Äù Rioco</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúRichfield Oil Company,‚</ENAMEX>Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mopeco for the ‚ÄúMobile Petroleum Company</ENAMEX>,‚Äù
Hepoco for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúHercules Powder Company,‚Äù Stoil</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúStandard Oil,‚Äù Biola for the ‚ÄúBible Institute of Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Angeles</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calwa for the ‚ÄúCalifornia Wine Association</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> had lived in the areas <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and
given names to certain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> that were fairly well
known, it is to be expected that some of their names
would be used: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cucamonga</ENAMEX> means `many waters,'
Supai `blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>,' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Navasota</ENAMEX> `muddy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>,' and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wichita</ENAMEX>
`many lodges.'  A siding named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Keene</ENAMEX> began as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> word Cheyenne but an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Irishman</ENAMEX> working
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railroad</ENAMEX> decided to make it look <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> and so he
changed it and added an apostrophe.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-seven</NUMEX> of the fifty <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have names taken
from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> languages that were spoken
on this continent when the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX>
arrived.  Sometimes a place or state name was borrowed
directly as was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asingsing</ENAMEX> , which became Sing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sing</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Messatossec</ENAMEX> which became <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>.
Quemessourit became <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ookannasa Arkansas</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uneaukara Niagara</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Machihaganing Michigan</ENAMEX> , and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Potawanmeac Potomac</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> changed the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pronunciations</ENAMEX> because the sound patterns in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
languages were so different from those of English
that they could not hear, much less imitate, the exact
words the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> were using.

            Some of the names have interesting stories behind
them.  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kalamazoo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>, is supposed to have got
its name from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Potawatomi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ke-ke</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">kala</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">kala</NUMEX>-mazoo
means something like `where the water
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boils</ENAMEX> (or steams) in the pot.'  Supposedly a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> bet
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that he could run to the river and back
before they could get a pot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to boil.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> Sleep ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX>, got its name because it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten days</TIMEX>' travel
by foot from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yellowstone</ENAMEX>.  Chugwater , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX>, is at
the bottom of a high bluff over which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>
would stampede buffalo to kill them.  When the bodies
of the buffalo his into the stream, they would make a
‚Äúchug‚Äù-like noise, hence the name.  Thunderbolt ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia</ENAMEX>, got its name <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> when a
bolt of lightning hit near the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>.  When the people
ran to see what had happened, they found a mineral
spring.  Believing that the lightning had created the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">spring</ENAMEX>, they named the area after the miraculous
event.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American English</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert H. Marckwardt</ENAMEX>,
contains the information that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> comes from an
Algonquian word meaning `garlic field.'  It is further
pointed out that words coming from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> languages
frequently undergo semantic change:


Mackinaw, the name of the island at the junction
of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lakes Huron</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>, according to one
explanation at least, was a shortening of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michili</ENAMEX>-mackinac,
meaning `great <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtle</ENAMEX>.'  The reason for
this application is clear enough to anyone who has
suddenly come upon the pine-wooded hills of the
island projecting from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.

            

            Mistranslations from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American Indian</ENAMEX> languages
were also common.  In his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illustrated Dictionary</ENAMEX>
of Place Names: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> , Kelsie
Harder points out that when the explorers asked the
Indians what a place was called, they responded
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúCanada.</ENAMEX>‚Äù  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> meant `<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>.' but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>
took it to mean the name of the area.

            Often a name which appears to be <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> is something
very different.  According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George R. Stewart</ENAMEX>,
in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">American Place Names, Wewanta</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> is
derived from the persistent plea in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> of ‚ÄúWe
want a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Stewart</ENAMEX> also reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Itasca</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX> is a manufactured name: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúCoined</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1832</TIMEX>
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W.T. Boutwell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.R. Schoolcraft</ENAMEX>, who believed
it to be the `true <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</ENAMEX>.  Boutwell
rendered this in crude <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veritas Caput</ENAMEX> ; Schoolcraft
joined the tail of the first word with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>.‚Äù

            A different type of mistranslation can result in a
strange kind of doublet.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mahoning/Licking</ENAMEX> came to us
partly as a transliteration, and partly as a translation.
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean L. Mutter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona State University</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tempe</ENAMEX>),


Upon learning that mahon-meant `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>-lick,' the
name was partially translated into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lick-ing</ENAMEX>,
the -ing being added by phonetic transfer and
probably some morphological influence, as well.

            

            Sometimes the borrowing of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> words was
complicated by going through a middle language, often
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.  For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sioux</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> (they
spoke <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omaha</ENAMEX>) called a river in the central part of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Niboapka</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Gasque</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of
Names points out that this word comes from ni `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>'
and bthaska `flat (like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>), spreading out.'  When
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> explorers came upon the name, they knew
enough <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sioux</ENAMEX> to know the name meant `<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>,' so they
used a translated version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> name and
called it la <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rivi√©re Platte</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> adopted
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> name and talked about the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Platte River</ENAMEX> .
They named <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> on its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> North
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Platte</ENAMEX> .  But when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> applied for admission to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1867</TIMEX>, it was under the original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> name
which they spelled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nebraska</ENAMEX> .

            In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> place
names have come from fifty different languages, but as
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> names, most of the pronunciations
have been anglicized and many of the words have been
translated.  The stress pattern of a place-name expression
can sometimes differentiate between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> meanings,
but this clue can be lost if names alternate between
languages.  In a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX> article in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Onoma</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henri</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dorion</ENAMEX> gives an example from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.  The name
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grande Rivi√©re de la Baleine</ENAMEX> became anglicized into
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Whale River</ENAMEX> , but this is ambiguous in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
since the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great</ENAMEX> can modify either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Whale</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River</ENAMEX> .
When it was translated back into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, the wrong
sense was used, and it became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rivi√©re de la Grande</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baleine</ENAMEX> rather than the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grande Rivi√©re de la</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baleine</ENAMEX> .

            Another often-mistaken etymology is the name
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajo</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>.  This is thought by many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to be
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> word for `garlic,' but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Multer</ENAMEX> points
out that an indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> has a similar-sounding
word meaning `paint,' and this might be the correct
origin of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>'s name:


The first documented source of the name was almost
certainly not written <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Papago</ENAMEX>.  Formerly, more
importance was placed on written <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> than on
the oral ones.  The surroundings supported both
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">derivations</ENAMEX>; the ores from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mines</ENAMEX> supplied red
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paint</ENAMEX>, and a type of onion, akin to garlic, grew
there.
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Multer</ENAMEX> adds that these conflicting bits of evidence
make the etymology of Ajo difficult to confirm.

            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stupey</ENAMEX>, similar but less commercial
names include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chanesa</ENAMEX> named after the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
of a railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nellie , and Sarah</ENAMEX> ; and
Edruvera , also named after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vera</ENAMEX> .  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daisy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cora</ENAMEX> , and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nora</ENAMEX> , were honored at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dacono</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna S. Wilson</ENAMEX> was
honored at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anness</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen Woods</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lenwood</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glendora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evadale</ENAMEX> were named to honour early
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">husband-and-wife</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Glen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dora</ENAMEX> and Eva
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale</ENAMEX> .

            Sometimes names were reversed.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yewed</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dewey</ENAMEX> ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corum</ENAMEX> is Muroc backwards.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enon</ENAMEX> is none, Saxet
is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reklaw</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker</ENAMEX> : there was already a
siding named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker</ENAMEX> and so when the same name was
again suggested, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> just reversed it.
The main reason for the reversals was that they allowed
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> to name a siding after himself without
appearing to be egocentric.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> was too humble
to have a siding named after him.  He was a popular
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rancher</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>.  When he declined the offer, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> said he was ‚Äúmucho modesto,‚Äù and they decided
to honor him indirectly by naming the siding
Modesto , now the name of a good-sized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.

            
               Tenino was named for the number <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äú1090</NUMEX>,‚Äù but
there is disagreement on its significance.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> story is
that locomotive Number <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1090</TIMEX> was wrecked nearby.
Another is that the elevation is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,090 feet</NUMEX>, and still
another is that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,090</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> lived there when the siding
was built.  There is an unconfirmed story that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laredo</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, was named for the sounds made by the
chimes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">la</ENAMEX>, re , and do .  Another
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk etymology</ENAMEX> has it that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Snake River</ENAMEX> was so
named because it coiled back and forth so much.  The
truth is, however, that it was named after the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Snake</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> of that area; and it is further true that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Snake Indians</ENAMEX> got their name from their habit of eating
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX>: that part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> was very
poor, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX> were often the only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> available.
Some names do not tell false stories; they tell no stories
at all.  Azusa for example is euphonious, but it does not
immediately suggest its own history.  In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Azusa</ENAMEX> was
made from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and last letters of the alphabet,
followed by ‚ÄúUSA.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù  Ding Dong</ENAMEX> was chosen as the
whimsical name for a siding in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bell County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>.

            Wish fulfillment is seen in the midst of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>'s
Death <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Valley</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sidings</ENAMEX> were given such coolsounding
names as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klondike</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Siberia</ENAMEX> .  These exotic
names also provided opportunities for playful statements
like, ‚ÄúWe're really sailing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.  We've come
from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fifteen minutes</TIMEX>.‚Äù

            The story is told that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railroad</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> met near
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Bernardino</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>.  The last item on the
agenda was to find a name for a new siding.  They had
each been instructed to bring a suggestion--perhaps a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>-sounding name, but one that was short and
easy to say.  Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s suggestion was rejected by the
others, hence they were surprised when the supervisor
ended the meeting saying they had made a unanimous
decision.  When questioned, he replied, ‚ÄúWell, you all
said, `<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">On</ENAMEX>, no!'  so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ono</ENAMEX> is what we'll use.‚Äù

            The most common way for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> to honor their
native lands and languages as they spread out over the
continent was to bring old names from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to their
new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX>, was called <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paradise</ENAMEX> until
its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">postmaster</ENAMEX> decided to change it.  This is
especially interesting in view of recent place-name
changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, whereby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsaritsyn</ENAMEX> was changed to
Stalingrad , then again to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volgograd</ENAMEX> .  Likewise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Petersburg</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Petrograd</ENAMEX> and later <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leningrad</ENAMEX> .
Even in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, politics change, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> go in
and out of favor.  In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúFrom Hero to Celebrity,‚Äù Daniel</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boorstin</NUMEX> points out that soon after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Lindbergh</ENAMEX>
acquired a reputation as a pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> and accepted a
decoration from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lindbergh Beacon</ENAMEX> atop a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">skyscraper</ENAMEX> was renamed the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palmolive Beacon</ENAMEX> ,
and high in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado Rockies Lindbergh Peak</ENAMEX>
was given the more obscure name of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lone Eagle Peak</ENAMEX> .

            Many names were brought over from the Old
World, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan; Shamrock</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waterloo</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Copenhagen</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>.
There is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf Service Station</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, so this is called, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">‚Äúthe Gulf of Mexico</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Staten Island</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> was named after the legislative
governing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Staten-General</ENAMEX> ,
perhaps because a meeting was held there in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1776</TIMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX>
tried unsuccessfully to negotiate a peaceful end to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Revolution</ENAMEX>.

            Picturesque images are often captured in names,
as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bridal Veil Falls</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teapot Dome</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX>.  In addition to these there is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shiprock</ENAMEX> , a
rock resembling a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, the Finger
Lakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sawtooth Mountain Range</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX>.  The ‚Äúsawtooth‚Äù metaphor occurs also in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Nevada</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> means ‚ÄúSnowcovered
Saw.‚Äù  In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Rock Candy Mountain</ENAMEX>
looks good enough to eat, and the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lemonade</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Springs</ENAMEX> makes a person thirsty.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chocolate Mountains</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> are brown; the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Painted Desert</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flaming Gorge</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX> are multicolored.

            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> are named after <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
There is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Pigeon</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Deer Isle</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elk Run Heights</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Deerfield</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raven</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> that had a
unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> name decided that the uniqueness was
not worth the bother.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ptarmigan</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX>, named after a wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> common to the area.
However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had such a hard time remembering
how to spell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptarmigan</ENAMEX> that they just began calling the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town Chicken</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX>.

            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> names express hope, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hope</ENAMEX> ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Freedom</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Era</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>,
and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paradise</ENAMEX> .  Once in a
while, however, a place gets a dysphemistic name,
such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Badlands</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great</ENAMEX> Dismal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swamp</ENAMEX> , which is a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1500-square-mile</NUMEX> section of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>.

            It is just for amusement that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ann</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arbor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> write ‚ÄúA¬≤‚Äù instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ann Arbor</ENAMEX> in
their return addresses; or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>
joke about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> , and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lyme</ENAMEX> ; or a motel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Comfort</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, which
happens to be near <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louise</ENAMEX> ,
puts up a billboard saying, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúSleep here in Comfort</ENAMEX>
between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louise</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

            Arizonans are amused at how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showlow</ENAMEX> and Why
were named.  Showlow started out as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> ranch
and got its name when it was won by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gambler</ENAMEX> who
showed the low card in a game of seven-up.  Why was a
winter campground in the desert where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would
bring their mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">campers</ENAMEX> and stay during
the cold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>.  When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> would arrive, many of
them would ask, ‚ÄúWhy here?‚Äù  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> decided to
take the words right out of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>' mouths by
naming the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> Why, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>.  Truth or Consequences ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, used to be named <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hot Springs</ENAMEX> ,
but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> voted to change its name
when the host of a popular radio show promised free
publicity to any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that would do such a thing.
Some names sound more appealing than they are.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lovers Retreat</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> has a violent rather than a romantic
history.  It is a rocky area where a rancher
named <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Lover hid</ENAMEX> among the boulders from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> intent
on killing him.

            It is not always possible to document the naming
of particular places.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intercourse</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>,
gets so many questions about the origin of its
name that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has printed a brochure offering
several explanations.  The name has been traced back
as far as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1814</TIMEX>, and one theory is that it was the local
term for a junction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>.  Another theory is
that there used to be a race <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> in the area and
Intercourse was the spot where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> entered onto
the course.  Calistoga , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, is supposed to have
been accidentally named when a real estate developer
from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sarasota</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, rose before a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> to give a
sales pitch for the new property he was promoting.  He
was nervous and instead of saying that it was going to
be the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sarasota</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> , he said it was going to be
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calistoga of Sarifornia</ENAMEX> .  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> were so amused
that the name stuck.  Eleva , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX>, is said to have
been named by the whim of a snowstorm.  It was in the
fall, and a sign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> was perched high on the side of
a newly completed grain elevator where he was to
paint the name of the grain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.  He started with
the word Elevator , but by the time he had finished the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> letters, he was forced down by the snowstorm.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winter</ENAMEX> had come and it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine months</TIMEX> before the
weather was good enough and the cement dry enough
to finish the painting.  But by then, the name was so
firmly established that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> did not bother to
climb up and finish the job.

            Ironic names are often given in hopes of achieving
a commercial advantage.  This is easily demonstrated
in the real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> work hard
to create names that will ‚Äúsell‚Äù their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.  Someone
developing a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on what used to be a swamp might
put a word like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Heights</ENAMEX> in the name to counteract
negative feelings or fears <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> might have about
leaking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basements</ENAMEX>.  Someone cutting up a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> into
small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lots</ENAMEX> will try to communicate a feeling of spaciousness
with such words as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ranch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manor</ENAMEX> , or
Garden .  Sometimes the onomastic irony merely resulted
in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> viable perceptions of the same place.
Talking about some original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> naming patterns,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelsie Harder</ENAMEX> said that ‚ÄúAt the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Grassy Meadow‚Äù</ENAMEX> might
be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s perception of a place, while ‚ÄúAt the
Chigger-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Infested Patch‚Äù</ENAMEX> might be another's.

            Some of the original place names were rather
crude and had to be changed to appeal to more genteel
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tastes</ENAMEX>, but such amelioration was sporadic.  Whore-house
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meadows</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> was changed to Naughty
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Girls Meadows</ENAMEX> by the federal mapmakers, and Bullshit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Springs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> was changed to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bullshirt Springs</ENAMEX> .  Interestingly,
the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> were very upset about
the first change, but not about the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Titus Canyon</ENAMEX>
is also a concealed obscenity.  The original name
was ‚ÄúTight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ass Canyon</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù</ENAMEX> named because of the narrowness
of the pass.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Rennick</ENAMEX> has noted that
many local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> were indignant that civilization
had chosen to modify the name.

            Some names, although they may be objectionable,
are not changed.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Eschholz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Rosa</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> quote an article which appeared in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 11, 1972</TIMEX> issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> .


Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> place names have a unique resonance
about them--places like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maggie</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nipples</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greasy Creek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lickskillet</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scroungeout</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX>.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Collectors</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Americana</ENAMEX> also savor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braggadocio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humptulips River</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hen Scratch</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dead Bastard Peak</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teats</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aswaguschwadic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>.

            

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years ago</TIMEX> we were volunteer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. Cassidy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of American Regional English</ENAMEX> .
In going through an early explorer's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> we found
frequent references to some mountains called The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teats</ENAMEX> .  After investigating we found that in the 1800s
this was the common name for what we now use
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> for so that we can genteelly talk about The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Tetons</ENAMEX> .

            Through selective editing, names can be chosen to
illustrate a desirable quality of a location.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cassidy</ENAMEX> also
found <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mud Lake</ENAMEX> transformed into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Silver Lake</ENAMEX> for purposes
of promotion.  An the other hand, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iceland</ENAMEX> gave their own island the unappealing name of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iceland</ENAMEX> in hopes of discouraging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> from
coming to what is actually a relatively warm and comfortable
place to live, since it is heated by geothermal
activity.  Then they named the neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>
which is actually covered with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 10,000</NUMEX> feet
deep in places-- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenland</ENAMEX> .  It might have been <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Red</ENAMEX> who bestowed the verdant name ‚ÄúGreenland‚Äù
upon the usually snow-and<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-ice</ENAMEX> covered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.

            This is a strange flip-flop, because in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just as today</TIMEX>, more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were interested in attracting
rather than repelling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX>.  We see this
in the way that postmasters increased their fame by
naming post <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> after their businesses.  The first
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> mail service began in conjunction with stagecoach
runs.  The stops were at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX> or country <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who ran the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> received a little extra
money to serve as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">postmaster</ENAMEX> and in this role could
decide on the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX>.  At first, little
attention was paid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX> name, but as mail
became increasingly important, it was the post office
name which often won out as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> name.  This is
how <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> got such names as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown Store</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yellow House</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Cabin</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Willey House</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macks Inn</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX>.
Mail for other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> was left at crossroads or
waterways, yielding the names of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Moores Bridge</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama; Paris Crossing</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tracys Landing</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maryland; Wells Bridge</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galivants Ferry</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harpers Ferry</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX>.

            Let us conclude with an insightful statement
made by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Taylor</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Words and Places :</ENAMEX>


The words of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s speech are continually
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clipped</ENAMEX> and worn down by constant currency, until,
like ancient coins, the legend which they bore at
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> becomes effaced.

            

            Unlike the ancient coins, however, the legends in place
names can sometimes be recovered.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bound</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gagged Morpheme</ENAMEX>



            For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about the last century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American English</ENAMEX> has
been openly kidnapping bits of words and putting
them to work as new bound morphemes without
the least regard for their original meanings--or,
rather, lack of meanings.  A morpheme is the smallest
unit of meaning in a language; a bound morpheme is
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that appears only in combination with another
morpheme, such as the suffixes and prefixes of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
The American propensity for lexical shanghaiing has
produced a new type of morpheme, the bound and
gagged morpheme.  It is a series of sounds impressed
into a kind of semantic slavery, for urltil recently the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collocations</ENAMEX> could do no semantic work on their own in
their present form.

            Admittedly I have given in to temptation in coining
the term ‚Äúbound and gagged morpheme‚Äù--the
temptation of wit.  Many of these new morphemes
have not been gagged at all, since no part of them
meant anything in thefirst place.  Still, let the term
stand.  It describes in spirit, at least, how neomorphemes
like -athon, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-tigue, -burger, -</ENAMEX>(a)teria,
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-alator, -ercize/-icize, -ician, -aholic, -</ENAMEX>on, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-capade</ENAMEX>,
-cade, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-alyzer</ENAMEX>, -gate, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">heli-</ENAMEX>, docu- have become affixes.

            The news and advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> have introduced
most such morphemes into common usage, a spinoff of
their tiieless search for novel, titillating ways to attract
public attention.  The pattern for coinage is simple and
uniform.  A familiar noun provides the model for variation,
usually because it contains a memorable ending.
Everything except this memorable portion of the word
is then dropped, and a new morpheme is substituted
in an innovation; once the innovation is generally
known, it suggests a pattern for further combinations
with the neomorpheme, whose meaning generalizes
upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>'s salient contemporary import.  Because
the model behind the original innovation must
be easily recognizable to provide material for a new
morpheme, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are either placenames or
common words for locations and activities.

            
               -<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Athon</ENAMEX> is the classic example, although not the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marathon</ENAMEX> provided the model after it was reintroduced
into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> with the First
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic Games</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1896</TIMEX>, according to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> .  The long-distance running event honored the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX> who in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">490</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX> ran to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> in order to
announce the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> victory over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX> on the
plains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marathon</ENAMEX>.  The grueling <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twenty-six-mile</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympic</ENAMEX> run has become one of the games' most popular
events, emblematic of the endurance and strength
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympian</ENAMEX> must have.

            But marathon soon escaped the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arena</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX>
competition and sport.  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1908</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily Chronicle</ENAMEX>
used it figuratively to characterize a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato</ENAMEX>-peeling
contest.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúThe Murphy Marathon</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and in the 1920s
endurance dances were regularly called marathons
(the earliest such reference, surprisingly, comes from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">dour Scotland</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glasgow Herald</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1923</TIMEX>).  But even in
these extensions of the word, - athon was only part of a
placename, even though now regularly applied to
physical activities, and had no meaning on its own in
either <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> or the original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>.  Then in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX> the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco Examiner</ENAMEX> reported on a telethon , cautiously
enclosing the word in quotation marks to show
it was a neologism.  It is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> citation in the OED
Supplement , Volume <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>), which defines the word
as a ‚ÄúTV program lasting <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</TIMEX>, especially to
solicit contributions,‚Äù coined by analogy from <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">marathon</ENAMEX> .
What had apparently happened was that a false
analysis had divided the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> event into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> specious
morphemes, as if mar(a) meant `running' and
-(a)thon meant `long' as a suffix.

            In any case, telethon took hold quickly.  By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1952</TIMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baltimore Sun</ENAMEX> could use it without the quotation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marks</ENAMEX>, and so it has become an ineradicable part of
viewing terminology, admitted into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s Third
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New International Dictionary</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX>.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OED</ENAMEX> insists
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telethon</ENAMEX> is ‚Äúorig. and chiefly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>,‚Äù but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australia</ENAMEX>
had taken it up by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>, and there was no more appropriate
word at hand in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX> when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Listener</ENAMEX> wrote, ‚ÄúPerhaps we have all been
corrupted by the telethons of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> television reporting.‚Äù
Perhaps we have.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telethon</ENAMEX> seems here to stay, sanctioned by dictionaries,
but no dictionary records the next innovation
with -athon , and I can only guess that the new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suffix</ENAMEX> began attaching to other base elements in the
1950s and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">'60s</TIMEX>.  As it is, the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX> have seen
a bewildering array of applications, all in the sense of
a `long-lasting, demanding activity,' a `test of endurance,'
or an `indication of enormous capacity.'  It has
appeared in such unlikely combinations as talkathon,
walkathon, aquathon, ski-a-thon, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX>-athon, birdathon,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sell</ENAMEX>-athon, sale-athon, curl-a-thon (a `hairstyling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extravaganza'</ENAMEX>), and even the seemingly unnecessary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jogathon</ENAMEX> and runathon (denoting more leisurely
or shorter races than a marathon).  Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">usages</ENAMEX> are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">self-explanatory</ENAMEX>, but not all.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toolathon</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bergen County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, rather than a construction
contest, and roofathon was an odd sales promotion in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX> involving bicyclists atop a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7-11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Reno</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX>.  That forms like sale-athon retain the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a even</TIMEX>
after the base element's e demonstrates that the -athon
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">marathon</ENAMEX> , rather than the -ethon of telethon , is
perceived as the primary form of the suffix, but the
matter has not been completely settled: consider alcothon
(which I hope was a test of abstinence rather
than indulgence).

            It will not do to heap scorn on -athon and denounce
athoninators as licentious with language.  A
new morpheme survives the novelty of its first innovation
(like telethon for - athon ) because it turns out to be
useful, almost as if by accident, and brings something
new into the idiom.  -<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Athon</ENAMEX> clearly serves a purpose
when a business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> or public relations representative
wants to advertise a lot of some activity with a
single, handy, distinctive term.  But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> alone has
not kept -athon current.  It is easy to reuse, and more
important, each new usage reflects an attempt at creativity,
however feeble.  What is easy and witty is
bound to become popular.  The hyphens that separate
-athon from the base morpheme is most new usages
surely are self-conscious attempts to call attention to
the wit invested in the coinage, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parsley</ENAMEX> atop a
casserole of leftovers.  It is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-facetious showmanship.

            Even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> taste for plundering
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placenames</ENAMEX> has provided words like telethon to other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nations</ENAMEX>, some have commited semantic thefts of their
own.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> peace movement, for example,
has taken -shima from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiroshima</ENAMEX> to denote a site of
nuclear devastation.  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúNein Euroshima‚</ENAMEX>Äù the astonished
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">visitor</ENAMEX> is likely to find on tee shirts and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalks</ENAMEX> wherever
anti-nuclear sentiments run strong.  I would like to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contribute ‚ÄúNo Amerishima‚</ENAMEX>Äù as well.

            A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> class of bound and gagged morphemes
comprises innovations based upon a portion of a common
term that is either not a morpheme or an incorrect
form of a morpheme used in a new sense.  My
favorite is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-ercise/-</ENAMEX>icise because of the notable diffidence
of its applications.  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s obsession with
physical fitness has brought us specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> calisthenics,
which we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designate jazzercise</ENAMEX>, aerobicise , or
dancercise on the model exercise , depending on what
type of music is playing or degree of enthusiasm.  But
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-ercise/-icise</ENAMEX> cannot mean simply `<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> dance exercises,'
because there is also sexercise , which almost certainly
involves neither large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> or dancing.

            These are only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> examples of the
bound and gagged morpheme.  More neomorphemes
and their consequent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neologisms</ENAMEX> exist than can be
sumupercised, spawned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> by ingenuity and the desire
to put some flash into news copy, advertising
drives, or the names of businesses.  Most will disappear
as quickly as they were created.  That is the way of all
flash.

            The bound and gagged morpheme is in fact the
stepchild of the pun and initially is meant to be recombined
only as long as it seems clever to do so.  It can
thrive because the temptation arises, so often too powerful
to resist, as was the case with this essay's title, to
throw in a little wit for good measure, even if without
much accuracy.  Like the puns above, most word forms
with newly created morphemes are incidental and almost
always dismissible, but not functionless.  They
make us pause to groan the groan that is nearly laughter.
Even when we scorn yet another neologism with
-athon , or ridicule a new -gate (as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Irangate</ENAMEX> ), or
wince at alcoholic becoming chocoholic , it has already
made us concentrate on language and refreshed our
interest by whetting our humor.  That is a function,
that is precious.

            And for all our groans to the contrary, bound and
gagged morphemes are a feature of our national disposition,
our lighthearted lack of regard for linguistic
tradition.  We can dismiss them no more than we can
dismiss our euphemisms, jargons, and gobbledygook
without frustrating our sensibility.  The neomorphemes
show that in public life we are in a hurry and do not
want to slow down long enough to devise an explanatory
phrase if we can pack enough of our intention into
a single word.  We can get by with a coinage like laughorama
because we know -orama's affiliation with panorama
will tell our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX> enough for the moment,
even though the innovation's -orama does not clearly
mean `view,' as it does in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.

            Here lies the most engaging feature of the lay
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> attitude toward language: meaning is an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">advisor</ENAMEX>, but not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX>, in usage.  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who
establish and preserve innovations are unlikely to have
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">philologist</ENAMEX>'s taste for etymological fidelity, but that
hardly means they are uneducated or uninterested in
language.  On the contrary, their attention to meaning
must be acute, even if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purists</ENAMEX> pale at the inelegance of
the many neologisms, because bound and gagged morphemes
succeed in communicating with marvelous
ease and utility.  No one could scorn them if they were
meaningless; then they would simply be empty oddities.
It is the emphasis of neologists, the nature of their
interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX>, that is intriguing--an interest in
playfulness over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">etymology</TIMEX>, an emphasis upon the wit
of brevity, and an ear finely tuned for useful novelty.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teachers</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> are usually credited
with setting the standard for usage; but in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, at least, theirs is not the only standard.  There
is rather a double standard, first the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
Standard that textbooks try to inculcate, the dignified
parlance of discourse, and then the related but divergent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Wit</ENAMEX>, the standard of ingenuity, which
trafficks freely in analogy, pun, and portmanteau.  At its
best it can enrich the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> idiom with phrases,
words, and even bound morphemes.
            Both -acute (execute to electrocute) and -alysis (analysis to urinalysis)

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the issues discussed at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX>-sponsored
seminar attended by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, including
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, was bad language (on radio and TV),
which, as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> become quickly aware,
seems to be used with far less inhibition in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> than
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>.  The situation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúimproving‚Äù</ENAMEX>--if
that is the correct word--in that some
TV films I have seen there recently have not had the
naughty bits bleeped out.  In the view of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hatch</ENAMEX>,
managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC Radio</ENAMEX>, a rude word on the
radio is not a rude word if it is sworn in context and
broadcast at the right time.  A rude word is, of course,
always a rude word, and the ‚Äúright time‚Äù is somewhat
arbitrary: it is not as though everyone is not familiar
with the rude words; indeed, those who object to them
the most are not likely to be in bed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine o'clock</TIMEX>.
The feeling, one assumes, is that broadcasting them,
regardless of context, at times when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are listening,
lends rude words a patina of approval that
inures them to the corrosive atmosphere of taboo.
Thus, when uttered by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> whose thumb has just
been struck by a hammer or who has suffered some
frustration or other outrage, any of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several four</NUMEX>-letter
words seem as natural as in real life.  When uttered in
circumstances where taboo language would seem either
gratuitous or otherwise inappropriate, rude words
are not only equally out of place in the world of make-believe
as in the real world but, worse, they interfere
(in both) with the message.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> comedians, though not quite as outspoken
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenny Bruce</ENAMEX>, show less restraint in their choice of
words than their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>, but the better
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">funnier</NUMEX>) ones (like the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ronnies</ENAMEX>) are typically
more subtle than the rest.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benny Hill</ENAMEX>, whose shows
have often been seen (too often, some might be
inclined to say) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>, rarely resorts to rude language,
focusing rather on what is viewed as a revival
of old burlesque routines in which there is much rolling
of the eyes, winking, and the sly aside to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>,
all of which add up to the rudeness being in the
mind of the beholder.  As many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> comedians
either speak with thick <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North or West</ENAMEX> Country
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accents</ENAMEX>, mumble, talk too fast, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>, it is sometimes
difficult to understand what they (and their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX>) are on about.  They appear to revel in the
delivery of punch lines that are totally unintelligible--not,
I hasten to say, because of a culture gap or a
diminution of (this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX>'s) auditory acuity but because
of essential lack of clarity of expression.

            As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Hamilton</ENAMEX>'s item in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 June</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>] reminds us, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> guidelines of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX>,
since abandoned, were quite specific: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúThere is an absolute
ban upon the following: jokes about lavatories,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">effeminacy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, immorality of any kind, suggestive
references to honeymoon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX>, chambermaids, fig
leaves, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX>' underwear, lodgers and commercial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">travellers</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù  Observation</ENAMEX> reveals that we have been
spared the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, but the rest are retained as mainstays
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> humor, especially knickers (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>: panties), the mere mention of which seems to
send everyone in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.K.</ENAMEX> in paroxysms of uncontrollable
laughter.  The same reaction is guaranteed by
references to poofs (`<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX>'), (big), boobs, lavatories,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-fronts (`<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jockey shorts'</ENAMEX>), and, especially, incontinence.
It is not suggested that these subjects be interdicted,
merely that it is difficult, even after some
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX> of acculturation, for an outlander to discern
much that is funny about them.  To me, the funniest
comedians by far, chiefly because much of their
humor is linguistic in nature, are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> Ronnies
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronnie Barker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronnie Corbett</ENAMEX>), whose TV appearances
came to an end <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early in 1988</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barker</ENAMEX>'s
announced retirement to run a business in antiques,
for which he doubtlessly acquired a taste from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benny</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX>'s jokes.  Another form of humor that enjoys great
popularity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> is that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transvestites</ENAMEX> like Barrie
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Humphreys (‚ÄúDame Edna Everage‚Äù</ENAMEX>), whom I find hilarious,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny LaRue</ENAMEX>, whom I have never seen.
They do not seem to appeal to insecure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who have
a defensive macho image of themselves (even in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>),
hence are likely to have less allure in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>

            Getting back to strong language, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.K.</ENAMEX> soap operas, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grange Hill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brookside</ENAMEX>, defended
its use on the grounds of realism, though it was
pointed out that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> for the latter had fallen
from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.5 million to 500,000</NUMEX> because of its language.  In
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.K.</ENAMEX> that would seem an over-reaction, and I
should <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">venture</ENAMEX> to suggest that the quality of the show
is more to blame.  On the other hand, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Wade</ENAMEX>
reports, ‚ÄúMore <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, it appears, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring</ENAMEX> or write in [to

other single subject.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>  [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Times</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 June 1988</TIMEX>] There
is probably something to be said in favour of the occasional
use of rude language in drama for the sake of
realism; on the other hand, in the real world rude
language is often the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of those who are unable to
